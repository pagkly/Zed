# Current and Noncurrent Assets: The Difference

> ## Excerpt
> Current assets are assets that are convertible to cash in less than a year; noncurrent assets are long-term assets. Here, we cover both.

---
In financial [[Accounting|accounting]], assets are the resources that a company requires in order to run and grow its business. Assets are divided into two categories: current and noncurrent assets, which appear on a company's [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) and combine to form a company's total assets.

## Current and Noncurrent Assets as Balance Sheet Items

The portion of ExxonMobil's balance sheet pictured below displays where you may find current and noncurrent assets.[[1]]

-   **Current assets** generally sit at the top of the balance sheet. Here, they are highlighted in green, and include receivables due to Exxon, along with [cash and cash equivalents](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashandcashequivalents.asp), [accounts receivable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp), and inventories.
-   **Noncurrent assets** are listed below current assets. These are highlighted in blue, and represent Exxon's long-term investments like oil rigs and production facilities that come under [property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppe.asp).
-   The combined **total assets** are highlighted in yellow.

## Understanding Short and Long-Term Assets

You may think of current assets as _short-term assets_, which are necessary for a company's immediate needs; whereas noncurrent assets are l_ong-term,_ as they have a useful life of more than a year.

## Current Assets: Short-Term

[Current assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp) are considered short-term assets because they generally are convertible to cash within a firm's fiscal year, and are the resources that a company needs to run its day-to-day operations and pay its current expenses. Current assets are generally reported on the balance sheet at their current or [market price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp).

Current assets may include items such as:

-   Cash and cash equivalents
-   Accounts receivable
-   Prepaid expenses
-   Inventory
-   Marketable securities

Cash and equivalents (that may be converted) may be used to pay a company's [short-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp). Accounts receivable consist of the expected payments from customers to be collected within one year. Inventory is also a current [[Asset|asset]] because it includes raw materials and finished goods that can be sold relatively quickly.

Another important current [[Asset|asset]] for any business is inventories. It is important for a company to maintain a certain level of inventory to run its business, but neither high nor low levels of inventory are desirable. Other current assets can include deferred income taxes and prepaid revenue.

## Noncurrent Assets: Long-Term

[Noncurrent assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncurrent-assets.asp) are a company’s [long-term investments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longterminvestments.asp) that have a useful life of more than one year. Noncurrent assets cannot be converted to cash easily. They are required for the long-term needs of a business and include things like land and heavy equipment.

Noncurrent assets are reported on the balance sheet at the price a company paid for them, which is adjusted for [depreciation and amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/amortizationvsdepreciation.asp) and is subject to being re-evaluated whenever the market price decreases compared to the [book price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp).

Noncurrent assets may include items such as:

-   Land
-   Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)
-   Trademarks
-   Long-term investments and [goodwill](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill.asp)—when a company acquires another company

Noncurrent assets may be subdivided into tangible and intangible assets—such as fixed and intangible assets.

[Fixed assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp) include property, plant, and equipment because they are tangible, meaning that they are physical in nature; we may touch them. A company cannot liquidate its PP&E easily. For example, an auto manufacturer's production facility would be labeled a noncurrent [[Asset|asset]].

[Intangible assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp) are nonphysical assets, such as patents and copyrights. They are considered as noncurrent assets because they provide value to a company but cannot be readily converted to cash within a year. Long-term investments, such as bonds and notes, are also considered noncurrent assets because a company usually holds these assets on its balance sheet for more than a year.

## How Current and Noncurrent Assets Differ: A Quick Look

Current Assets

-   Equal to cash or will be converted into cash within a year
    
-   Used to fund immediate or current needs
    
-   Items like cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivables, inventories
    
-   Valued at market prices
    
-   Tax implications: Selling current assets results in the profit from trading activities
    
-   Current assets generally not subject to revaluation—though in certain cases, inventories subject to revaluation
    

Noncurrent Assets

-   Will not be converted into cash within one year
    
-   Used to fund long-term or future needs
    
-   Items like long term investments, PP&E, goodwill, depreciation and amortization, long-term deferred taxes assets
    
-   Valued at cost less depreciation
    
-   Tax implications: Selling assets results in capital gains and capital gains tax is applied
    
-   Common revaluation of PP&E—for instance, when the market value of a tangible [[Asset|asset]] decreases compared to the [[Book|book]] value, a firm needs to revalue that [[Asset|asset]]
