## Understanding Articles of Association

Articles of association often identify the manner in which a company will issue shares, pay [dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp), audit financial records, and provide [voting rights](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp).

### Company Name

As a legal entity, the company must have a name that can be found in the articles of association. All jurisdictions will have rules concerning company names. Usually, a suffix such as "Inc." or "Ltd." must be used to show that the entity is a company. Also, some words that could confuse the public, such as "government" or "church," cannot be used or must be used only for specific types of entities. Words that are offensive or heinous are also usually prohibited.

### Purpose of the Company

The reason for the creation of the company must also be stated in the articles of association. Some jurisdictions accept very broad purposes—"management"—while others require greater detail—"the operation of a wholesale bakery," for example.

### Share Capital

The number and type of shares that comprise a company's capital are listed in the articles of association. There will always be at least one form of [common share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp) that makes up a company's capital. In addition, there may be several types of [preferred shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp). The company may or may not [issue the shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issuedshares.asp), but if they are found in the articles of association, they can be issued if and when the need presents itself.

A company may or may not issue shares, but if they are listed in the articles of association, shares can be issued if and when needed.

## Small Business Example of Articles of Association

A person, or group of people, starting a business will typically refer to a lawyer, [accountant](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountant.asp), or both for advice when setting up a company.

The company will choose a name and define its purpose. The company is then registered at the state/province or federal level. Note that [trademarking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trademark.asp) a name is a different process.

A company may issue shares to divide up the company if it wishes, but it doesn't need to. The articles will lay out how this can be done. The lawyer or accountant will typically work with the directors of the company, asking them questions to help figure out how they wish to grow and how the company may end up being structured in the future.

Company directors are listed, along with their personal information. A business address is also provided.

Changes can be made to the articles of association with director(s) approval.
