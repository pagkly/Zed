## What Is Electronic Commerce (e-commerce)?

Electronic commerce or e-commerce (sometimes written as eCommerce_)_ is a [business model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp) that lets firms and individuals buy and sell things over the internet. E-commerce operates in all four of the following major market segments:

-   Business to business
-   Business to consumer
-   Consumer to consumer
-   Consumer to business

E-commerce, which can be conducted over computers, tablets, or smartphones may be thought of like a digital version of mail-order catalog shopping. Nearly every imaginable product and service is available through e-commerce transactions, including books, music, plane tickets, and financial services such as [stock investing](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/etfs-mutual-funds/080516/4-etfs-fang-stocks-fdnpnqiqqqskyy.asp) and online banking. As such, it is considered a very [disruptive technology](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disruptive-technology.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet.
-   E-commerce can be a substitute for brick-and-mortar stores, though some businesses choose to maintain both.
-   Almost anything can be purchased through e-commerce today.

E-commerce lets firms and individuals conduct business over the Internet.

## Understanding Electronic Commerce (e-commerce)

E-commerce has helped businesses establish a wider market presence by providing cheaper and more efficient distribution channels for their products or services. For example, the mass retailer Target has supplemented its [brick-and-mortar](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brickandmortar.asp) presence with an online store that lets customers purchase everything from clothes to coffeemakers to toothpaste to action figures.

By contrast, [Amazon](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-from-amazon-earnings-4685379) launched its business with an e-commerce-based model of online sales and product delivery. Not to be outdone, individual sellers have increasingly engaged in e-commerce transactions via their own personal websites. Finally, digital marketplaces such as eBay or Etsy serve as exchanges where multitudes of buyers and sellers come together to conduct business.

## The Advantages and Disadvantages of Electronic Commerce

E-commerce offers consumers the following advantages:

-   **Convenience_._** E-commerce can occur 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
-   **Increased selection_._** Many stores offer a wider array of products online than they carry in their brick-and-mortar counterparts. And many stores that solely exist online may offer consumers exclusive inventory that is unavailable elsewhere.

E-commerce carries the following disadvantages:

-   **Limited customer service.** If you are shopping online for a computer, you cannot simply ask an employee to demonstrate a particular model's features in person. And although some websites let you chat online with a staff member, this is not a typical practice.
-   **Lack of instant gratification.** When you buy an item online, you must wait for it to be shipped to your home or office. However, [retailers like Amazon](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/electronic-retailing-e-tailing.asp) make the waiting game a little bit less painful by offering same-day delivery as a premium option for select products.
-   **Inability to touch products_._** Online images do not necessarily convey the whole story about an item, and so e-commerce purchases can be unsatisfying when the products received do not match consumer expectations. Case in point: an item of clothing may be made from shoddier fabric than its online image indicates.
