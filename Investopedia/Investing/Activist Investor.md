An activist investor is an individual or group that buys a significant stake in a public company in order to influence how the company is run, such as by obtaining seats on its [board of directors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp). Companies that are mismanaged, have excessive costs, could be run more profitably if taken private, or have other problems the activist investor believes they can fix are often targets for activist investors.

## Breaking Down Activist Investor

Private equity firms, hedge funds and wealthy individuals are the types of investors that might decide to act as [shareholder activists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholderactivist.asp).
