## What Does Accredited in Business Valuation Mean?

Accredited in Business Valuation (ABV) is a professional designation awarded to a certified public accountant ([CPA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpa.asp)), who specializes in calculating businesses' value. The ABV certification is overseen by the [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/american-institute-of-certified-public-accountants.asp) (AICPA). It requires candidates to complete an application process, pass an exam, meet the minimum business experience and education requirements, and pay a credential fee. As of 2021, the annual fee for the ABV Credential was $380.1

## Accredited In Business Valuation Exam

The ABV Exam is conducted by computer and consists of two parts. Both parts must be passed in 12 months (based on passing the first part) to receive ABV credit.

Applicants are given three hours and 15-minutes to complete each section of the test, including a 15-minute break. The exam consists of 90 multiple-choice questions per module, and much of the exam are discrete multiple-choice questions (78 in total). A dozen questions are case studies with accompanying multiple-choice answers. These questions are meant to test a candidate's analytical aptitude and apply valuation theory and methodology.
