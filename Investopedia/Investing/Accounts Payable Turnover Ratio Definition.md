A limitation of the ratio could be when a company has a high turnover ratio, which would be considered as a positive development by creditors and investors. If the ratio is so much higher than other companies within the same industry, it could indicate that the company is not investing in its future or using its cash properly.

In other words, a high or low ratio shouldn't be taken on face value, but instead, lead investors to investigate further as to the reason for the high or low ratio.

## Example of the Accounts Payable Turnover Ratio

Company A purchases its materials and inventory from one supplier and for the past year had the following results:

-   Total supplier purchases were $100 million for the year.
-   Accounts payable was $30 million for the start of the year while accounts payable came in at $50 million at the end of the year.
-   The average accounts payable for the entire year is calculated as follows:
-   ($30 million + $50 million) / 2 or $40 million
-   The accounts payable turnover ratio is calculated as follows:
-   $100 million / $40 million equals 2.5 for the year
-   Company A paid off their accounts payables 2.5 times during the year.

Assume that during the same year, Company B, a competitor of Company A had the following results for the year:

-   Total supplier purchases were $110 million for the year.
-   Accounts payable of $15 million for the start of the year and by the end of the year had $20 million.
-   The average accounts payable is calculated as follows:
-   ($15 million + $20 million) / 2 or $17.50 million
-   The accounts payable turnover ratio is calculated as follows:
-   $110 million / $17.50 million equals 6.29 for the year
-   Company A paid off their accounts payables 6.9 times during the year. Therefore, when compared to Company A, Company B is paying off its suppliers at a faster rate.
