### Key Takeaways

-   An activity ratio broadly describes any type of financial metric that helps investors and research analysts gauge how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenues and cash.
-   Activity ratios may be utilized to compare two different businesses within the same sector, or they may be used to monitor a single company's fiscal health over time.
-   Activity ratios can be subdivided into merchandise inventory turnover ratios, total assets turnover ratios, return on equity measurements, and a spectrum of other metrics.

## Understanding Activity Ratios

Activity ratios are most useful when employed to compare two competing businesses within the same industry to determine how a particular company stacks up amongst its peers. But activity ratios may also be used to track a company's fiscal progress over multiple recording periods, to detect changes over time. These numbers can be mapped to present a forward-looking picture of a company's prospective performance.

Activity ratios can be broken down into the following sub-categories:

### Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio

The [accounts receivable turnover ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/receivableturnoverratio.asp) determines an entity's ability to collect money from its customers. Total credit sales are divided by the average accounts receivable balance for a specific period. A low ratio suggests a deficiency in the collection process.

### Merchandise Inventory Turnover Ratio

The merchandise inventory turnover ratio measures how often the inventory balance is sold during an [accounting period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountingperiod.asp). The [cost of goods sold](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp) is divided by the [average inventory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/average-inventory.asp) for a specific period. Higher calculations suggest that a company can move its inventory with relative ease.

### Total Assets Turnover Ratio

The total assets turnover ratio measures how efficiently an entity uses its assets to tender a sale. Total sales are divided by total assets to decipher how proficiently a business uses its assets. Smaller ratios may indicate that a company is struggling to move its products.

### Return on Equity

A performance metric knows as return on equity (ROE) measures the revenues raised from shareholder equity. ROE is calculated by dividing net income by all outstanding stock shares in the market.

### Asset Turnover Ratio

A metric called the [asset turnover ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetturnover.asp) measures the amount of revenue a company generates per dollar of assets. This figure, which is simply calculated by dividing a company's sales by its total assets, reveals how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate sales.

## Activity Ratios Vs. Profitability Ratios

Activity ratios and [profitability ratios](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitabilityratios.asp) are both fundamental analytical tools that help investors evaluate different facets of a company's fiscal strength. Profitability ratios depict a company's profit generation, while efficiency ratios measure how well a company utilizes its resources to generate those profits. Profitability ratios may help analysts compare a company's profits with those of its industry competitors, while also tracking the same company's progress across several different reporting periods.
