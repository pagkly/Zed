## What Are Accounting Policies?

Accounting policies are the specific principles and procedures implemented by a company's management team that are used to prepare its [financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp). These include any accounting methods, measurement systems, and procedures for presenting disclosures. Accounting policies differ from [accounting principles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-principles.asp) in that the principles are the accounting rules and the policies are a company's way of adhering to those rules.

### Key Takeaways

-   Accounting policies are procedures that a company uses to prepare financial statements. Unlike accounting principles, which are rules, accounting policies are the standards for following those rules. 
-   Accounting policies may be used to manipulate earnings legally.
-   A company's choice in accounting policies will indicate whether management is aggressive or conservative in reporting its earnings.
-   Accounting policies still need to adhere to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

## How Accounting Policies Are Used

Accounting policies are a set of standards that govern how a company prepares its financial statements. These policies are used to deal specifically with complicated accounting practices such as [depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) methods, recognition of [goodwill](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill.asp), preparation of research and development (R&D) costs, inventory valuation, and the consolidation of financial accounts. These policies may differ from company to company, but all accounting policies are required to conform to [generally accepted accounting principles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) (GAAP) and/or international financial reporting standards (IFRS).

Accounting principles can be thought of as a framework in which a company is expected to operate. However, the framework is somewhat flexible, and a company's management team can choose specific accounting policies that are advantageous to the financial reporting of the company. Because accounting principles are lenient at times, the specific policies of a company are very important.

Looking into a company's accounting policies can signal whether management is conservative or aggressive when reporting [earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp). This should be taken into account by investors when reviewing earnings reports to assess the [quality of earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualityofearnings.asp). Also, external auditors who are hired to review a company's financial statements should review the company's policies to ensure they conform to GAAP.

### Important

Company management can select accounting policies that are advantageous to their own financial reporting, such as selecting a particular inventory valuation method.

## Example of an Accounting Policy

Accounting policies can be used to legally manipulate earnings. For example, companies are allowed to value inventory using the [average cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averagecostmethod.asp), [first in first out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fifo.asp) (FIFO), or [last in first out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifo.asp) (LIFO) methods of accounting. Under the average cost method, when a company sells a product, the weighted average cost of all inventory produced or acquired in the [accounting period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountingperiod.asp) is used to determine the [cost of goods sold](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp) (COGS).

Under the FIFO inventory cost method, when a company sells a product, the cost of the inventory produced or acquired first is considered to be sold. Under the LIFO method, when a product is sold, the cost of the inventory produced last is considered to be sold. In periods of rising inventory prices, a company can use these accounting policies to increase or decrease its earnings.

For example, a company in the manufacturing industry buys inventory at $10 per unit for the first half of the month and $12 per unit for the second half of the month. The company ends up purchasing a total of 10 units at $10 and 10 units at $12 and sells a total of 15 units for the entire month. 

If the company uses FIFO, its cost of goods sold is: (10 x $10) + (5 x $12) = $160. If it uses average cost, its cost of goods sold is: (15 x $11) = $165. If it uses LIFO, its cost of goods sold is: (10 x $12) + (5 x $10) = $170. It is therefore advantageous to use the FIFO method in periods of rising prices in order to minimize the cost of goods sold and increase earnings.
