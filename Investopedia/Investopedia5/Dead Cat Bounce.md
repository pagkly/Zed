Dead Cat Bounce
## What Is a Dead Cat Bounce?

A dead cat bounce is a temporary, short-lived recovery of asset prices from a prolonged decline or a [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) that is followed by the continuation of the [downtrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtrend.asp). Frequently, downtrends are interrupted by brief periods of recovery—or small rallies—during which prices temporarily rise.

The name "dead cat bounce" is based on the notion that even a dead cat will bounce if it falls far enough and fast enough. It is an example of a [sucker's rally](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sucker-rally.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A dead cat bounce is a short-lived and often sharp rally that occurs within a secular downtrend, or one that is unsupported by fundamentals that is reversed by price movement to the downside.
-   In technical analysis, a dead cat bounce is considered to be a continuation pattern, where at first the bounce may appear to be a reversal of the prevailing trend, but it is quickly followed by a continuation of the downward price move. 
-   Dead cat bounce patterns are usually only realized after the fact and are difficult to identify in real-time.

## What Does a Dead Cat Bounce Tell You?

A dead cat bounce is a price pattern used by technical analysts. It is considered a [continuation pattern](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/continuationpattern.asp), where at first the bounce may appear to be a reversal of the prevailing trend, but it is quickly followed by a continuation of the downward price move. It becomes a dead cat bounce (and not a [reversal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp)) after the price drops below its prior low.

Frequently, downtrends are interrupted by brief periods of recovery, or small [rallies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rally.asp), when prices temporarily rise. This can be a result of traders or investors closing out [short positions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) or buying on the assumption that the security has reached a bottom.

A dead cat bounce is a [price pattern](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/112601.asp) that is usually recognized in hindsight. Analysts may attempt to predict that the recovery will be only temporary by using certain technical and [fundamental analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) tools. A dead cat bounce can be seen in the broader economy, such as during the depths of a recession, or it can be seen in the price of an individual stock or group of stocks.

Short-term traders may attempt to profit from the small rally, and traders and investors might try to use the temporary reversal as a good opportunity to initiate a short position.

Similar to identifying a market peak or trough, recognizing a dead cat bounce ahead of time is fraught with difficulty, even for skilled investors. In March 2009, for example, economist Nouriel Roubini of New York University referred to the [incipient stock market recovery](https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2009/03/roubini-reflections-on-latest-suckers.html) as a dead cat bounce, predicting that the market would reverse course in short order and plummet to new lows. Instead, March 2009 marked the beginning of a protracted [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp), eventually surpassing its pre-recession high.1

## Example of a Dead Cat Bounce

Let's consider a historical example. Stock prices for Cisco Systems peaked at $82 per share in March 2000 before falling to $15.81 in March 2001 amid the [dot-com collapse](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp).

Cisco saw many dead cat bounces in the ensuing years. The stock recovered to $20.44 by November 2001, only to fall to $10.48 by September 2002. Fast forward to June 2016 and Cisco traded at $28.47 per share, barely one-third of its peak price during the tech bubble in 2000.2

### $43

Cisco's average share price in 2020, with highs of $48 and lows of $32.

## Limitations in Identifying a Dead Cat Bounce

As mentioned above, most of the time a dead cat bounce can only be identified after the fact. This means that traders that notice a rally after a steep decline may think it is a dead cat bounce when in reality it is a trend reversal signaling a prolonged upswing.

How can investors determine whether a current upward movement is a dead cat bounce or a market reversal? If we could answer this correctly all the time, we'd be able to make a lot of money. The fact is that there is no simple answer to spotting a market [bottom](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottom.asp).
