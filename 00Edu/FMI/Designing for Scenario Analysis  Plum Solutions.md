Designing for Scenario Analysis | Plum Solutions
If you have any questions or problems throughout the course, you can get help in the following ways:

-   Email us directly at info@plumsolutions.com.au
-   Telephone +612 9818 7250 during business hours AEST (Sydney, Australia)
-   Log into the website, and click on the Live Support button on the bottom right-hand side

Note that for the exam, you will only need to perform drop-down scenarios, either as a data validation or combo-box, but in my opinion, any good financial modeller should know how to use the other methods as well!

**Step 1:** Download the Course Materials

-   [Scenarios, Sensitivities & What-if Analysis](https://plumsolutions.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Scenarios-Sensitivities-What-if-Analysis.xlsx) is used in the first video

**Step 2:** Complete each of the lesson topics  
**Step 3:** Take the quiz
