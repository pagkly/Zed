_This module forms part of the_ _[](https://www.plumsolutions.com.au/online-courses/financial-modelling-excel-online)_ _[FMI Level 1 – Exam Preparation](https://plumsolutions.com.au/courses/fmi-level-1-exam-preparation/)_ _online course._

The first two videos contain some strategies on how to best set up the file to get started on the exam, and the last one is on general assumptions documentation. Getting your model set up right in the first place is going to save you a HUGE amount of time during the exam, as formatting can be very time-consuming. You need to practice setting up the model with all the correct tabs and formatting within the first 5 minutes as soon as you get into the exam, and that way you can spend the next 3 hours and 55 minutes focussing on building your model!
