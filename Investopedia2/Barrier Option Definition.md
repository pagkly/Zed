Barrier Option Definition
## What is a Barrier Option

A barrier option is a type of [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) where the payoff depends on whether or not the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp) has reached or exceeded a predetermined price. A barrier option can be a [knock-out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knock-outoption.asp), meaning it expires worthless if the underlying exceeds a certain price, limiting profits for the holder and limiting losses for the [writer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writer.asp). It can also be a [knock-in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knock-inoption.asp), meaning it has no value until the underlying reaches a certain price. 

## Basics of a Barrier Option

Barrier options are considered [exotic options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exoticoption.asp) because they are more complex than basic [American](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/americanoption.asp) or [European](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanoption.asp) options. Barrier options are also considered a type of path-dependent option because their value fluctuates as the underlying's [value changes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value-change.asp) during the option's contract term. In other words, a barrier option's payoff is based on the underlying asset's price path. The option becomes worthless or may be activated upon crossing of a price point barrier. Barrier options are typically classified as either knock-in or knock-out.

## Knock-In Barrier Options

A [knock-In](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knock-inoption.asp) option is a type of barrier option where the rights associated with that option only come into existence when the price of the underlying security reaches a specified barrier during the option's life. Once a barrier is knocked in, or comes into existence, the option remains in existence until it expires.

Knock-in options may be classified as [up-and-in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/up-and-inoption.asp) or [down-and-in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daio.asp). In an up-and-in barrier option, the option only comes into existence if the price of the underlying asset rises above the pre-specified barrier, which is set above the underlying's initial price. Conversely, a down-and-in barrier option only comes into existence when the underlying asset price moves below a pre-determined barrier that is set below the underlying's initial price.

## Knock-Out Barrier Options

Contrary to knock-in barrier options, [knock-out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knock-outoption.asp) barrier options cease to exist if the underlying asset reaches a barrier during the life of the option. Knock-out barrier options may be classified as [up-and-out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/up-and-outoption.asp) or [down-and-out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daoo.asp). An up-and-out option ceases to exist when the underlying security moves above a barrier that is set above the underlying's initial price. A down-and-out option ceases to exist when the underlying asset moves below a barrier that is set below the underlying's initial price. If an underlying asset reaches the barrier at any time during the option's life, the option is knocked out, or terminated.

## Other Types of Barrier Options

Other variants of the barrier options described above are possible. Here are three of them:

1.  **_Rebate Barrier Options_**: Both knock-out and knock-in barrier options can contain a provision to provide rebates to holders, if the option does not reach the barrier price and becomes worthless. Such options are known as [rebate barrier options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebatebarrieroption.asp). Rebates, in such cases, take the form of a percentage of the premium paid by the holder for the option.
2.  **_Turbo Warrant Barrier Options:_** Mainly traded in Europe and Hong Kong, Turbo warrant are a type of down-and-out option that are highly leveraged and are characterized by low volatility. They are popular in Germany and are used for speculation purposes.
3.  **_Parisian Option:_** In a Parisian option, reaching the barrier price does not trigger the contract. Instead the underlying asset's price has to spend a pre-defined amount of time beyond the trigger barrier price for the contract to kick in. The amount of time that the underlying asset's price spends outside and inside the barrier price range is measured in this type of option.

## Reasons To Trade Barrier Options

Because barrier options have additional conditions built in, they tend to have cheaper [premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp) than comparable options with no barriers. Therefore, if a trader believes the barrier is unlikely to be reached, then they may opt to buy a knock-out option, for example, since it has a lower premium and the barrier condition is unlikely to affect them. 

Someone who wants to [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) a position, but only if the price of the underlying reaches a specific level, may opt to use knock-in options. The lower premium of the barrier option may make this more appealing than using non-barrier American or European options.

### Key Takeaways

-   Barrier options are a type of option in which payout depends on whether the option has reached or exceeded a pre-determined barrier price.
-   Barrier options offer cheaper premiums as compared to standard options and are also used to hedge positions.
-   There are primarily two types of barrier options: Knock-out and Knock-in barrier options.

## Examples of Barrier Options

Here are two examples of barrier options described above.

### Knock-In Barrier Option

Assume an investor purchases an up-and-in call option with a strike price of $60 and a barrier of $65, when the underlying stock is trading at $55. The option would not come into existence until the underlying stock price moved above $65. While the investor pays for the option, and the potential that it could become valuable, the option only becomes applicable if the underlying reaches $65. If it doesn't, the option is never triggered and the option buyer loses what they paid for the option.

### Knock-Out barrier option

Assume a trader purchased an up-and-out put option with a barrier of $25 and a strike price of $20, when the underlying security was trading at $18. The underlying security rises above $25 during the life of the option, and therefore, the option ceases to exist. The option is now worthless, even if it only touched $25 briefly and then dropped back below.
