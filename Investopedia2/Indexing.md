Indexing
## What is Indexing?

Indexing is broadly referred to as an indicator or measure of something. In the financial markets, indexing can be used as a statistical measure for tracking economic data, a methodology for grouping a specific market segment or as an investment management strategy for passive investments.

## Understanding Indexing

Indexing is used in the financial market as a statistical measure for tracking economic data. Indexes created by economists provide some of the market’s leading indicators for economic trends. Economic indexes closely followed in the financial markets include the [Purchasing Managers' Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pmi.asp), the [Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ism-mfg.asp) and the [Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cili.asp).

Statistical indexes may also be used as a gauge for linking values. The cost of living adjustment (COLA) is a statistical measure obtained through analysis of the Consumer Price Index. Many pension plans use COLA and the Consumer Price Index as a measure for retirement benefit payout adjustments with the adjustment using inflation-based indexing measures.

### Key Takeaways

-   Indexing is the practice of compiling economic data into a single metric.
-   There are many indices in finance that reflect on economic activity or summarize market activity - these become performance benchmarks against which portfolios and fund managers are measured against.
-   Indexing is also used to refer to passively investing in market indices to replicate broad market returns rather than actively selecting individual stocks.

## Indexing in the Investment Market

In the investment market, indexes exist to represent specific market segments. Leading market indexes in the U.S. are the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500. Indexes are constructed with specified methodologies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted index giving greater weight to stocks in the index with a higher price. The S&P 500 Index is a market-capitalization weighted index giving greater weight to stocks in the S&P 500 Index with a higher market capitalization.

Index providers have numerous methodologies for constructing investment market indexes. Investors and market participants use these indices as benchmarks on performance. If a fund manager is underperforming the S&P 500 over the long-term, for example, it will be hard to entice investors into the fund rather than an exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500.

## Indexing and Passive Investing

Indexing is broadly known in the investment industry as a passive investment strategy for gaining targeted exposure to a specified market segment. The majority of active investment managers typically do not consistently beat index benchmarks. Moreover, investing in a targeted segment of the market for capital appreciation or as a long-term investment can be expensive given the trading costs associated with buying individual securities. Therefore, indexing is a popular option for many investors.

An investor can achieve the same risk and return of a target index by investing in an [index fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp). Most index funds have low expense ratios and work well in a passively managed portfolio. Index funds can be constructed using individual stocks and bonds to replicate the target indices. They can also be managed as a [fund of funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp) with mutual funds or exchange-traded funds as their base holdings.

## Indexing and Tracker Funds

More complex indexing strategies may seek to replicate the holdings and returns of a customized index. Customized index tracking funds have evolved as a low-cost investment option for investing in a screened subset of securities. These tracker funds are essentially trying to take the best of the best within a category of stocks - for example, the best energy companies within the indices that track the energy industry. These tracking funds are based on a range of filters including fundamentals, dividends, growth characteristics and more.
