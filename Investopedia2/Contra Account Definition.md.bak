Contra Account Definition
## What Is a Contra Account?

A contra account is used in a [general ledger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalledger.asp) to reduce the value of a related account when the two are netted together. A contra account's natural balance is the opposite of the associated account. If a debit is the natural balance recorded in the related account, the contra account records a credit.

## Understanding Contra Accounts

Contra accounts are reported on the same [financial statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) as the associated account. For example, a contra account to accounts receivable is a contra asset account. This type of account could be called the [allowance for doubtful accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/allowancefordoubtfulaccounts.asp) or [bad debt reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baddebtreserve.asp). The balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts represents the dollar amount of the current accounts receivable balance that is expected to be uncollectible. The amount is reported on the [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) in the asset section immediately below accounts receivable. The net of these two figures is typically reported on a third line.

### Key Takeaways

-   A contra account is an account used in a general ledger to reduce the value of a related account.
-   They are useful to preserve the historical value in a main account while presenting a decrease or write-down in a separate contra account that nets to the current book value.
-   Contra accounts are presented on the same financial statement as the associated account, typically appearing directly below it with a third line for the net amount.

Accountants use contra accounts rather than reduce the value of the original account directly to keep financial accounting records clean. If a contra account is not used, it can be difficult to determine [historical costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historical-cost.asp), which can make tax preparation more difficult and time-consuming. By keeping the original dollar amount intact in the original account and reducing the figure in a separate account, the financial information is more transparent for financial reporting purposes. For example, if a piece of heavy machinery is purchased for $10,000, that $10,000 figure is maintained on the general ledger even as the asset's [depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) is recorded separately.

Contra accounts provide more detail to accounting figures and improve transparency in financial reporting.

## Recording Contra Accounts

When a contra asset account is first recorded in a journal entry, the offset is to an expense. For example, an increase in the form of a credit to allowance for doubtful accounts is also recorded as a debit to increase [bad debt expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bad-debt-expense.asp).

When accounting for assets, the difference between the asset's account balance and the contra account balance is referred to as the [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp). There are two major methods of determining what should be booked into a contra account. The allowance method of accounting allows a company to estimate what amount is reasonable to book into the contra account. The percentage of sales method assumes that the company cannot collect payment for a fixed percentage of goods or services that it has sold. Both methods result in an adjustment to book value.

For example, a company has $40,000 worth of accounts receivable at September month end. It estimates 10% of its accounts receivable will be uncollectible and proceeds to create a credit entry of 10% x $40,000 = $4,000 in the contra account, allowance for doubtful accounts. In order to balance the journal entry, a debit will be made to the bad debt expense for $4,000. Although the accounts receivable is not due in September, the company still has to report credit losses of $4,000 as bad debts expense in its income statement for the month. If accounts receivable is $40,000 and allowance for doubtful accounts is $4,000, the net book value reported on the balance sheet will be $36,000.

### Fast Fact

The difference between an asset's account balance and the contra account balance is known as the book value.

## Examples of Contra Accounts

Another example of a contra asset account is the [accumulated depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulated-depreciation.asp) account which reduces the reporting value of [capital assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalasset.asp). Allowance for [obsolete inventory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obsoleteinventory.asp) or obsolete inventory reserve are also examples of contra asset accounts. Sales returns is a contra revenue account as the figure is a negative amount net against total sales revenue. It would appear on the company's income statement in the revenue section.
