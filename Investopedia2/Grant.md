## What Is a Grant?

A grant is an award, usually financial, given by one entity (typically a company, foundation, or government) to an individual or a company to facilitate a goal or incentivize performance. Grants are essentially gifts that do not have to be paid back, under most conditions. These can include [education loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/education-loan.asp), research money, and [stock options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp). Some grants have waiting periods—called lock-up or vesting periods—before the grantee can take full ownership of the financial reward.

## Option Grants Explained

For businesses, a grant usually refers to the award of [options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) on the company's stock given to an employee to elicit loyalty and incentivize strong job performance. After the waiting period, the employee can then [exercise](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp) these stock options and take position of shares, often at a price below the market value of the stock at the time. Sometimes actual shares of stock are granted and can be sold after a waiting period.

### Key Takeaways

-   A grant is a gift to an individual or company that does not need to be paid back.
-   Research money, education loans, and stock options are some examples of grants.
-   Companies sometimes offer stock options as a way to incentivize performance.
-   Qualified stock option grants are eligible for favorable tax treatment, but typically cannot be passed on to others, unless in a will or trust.
-   Non-qualified stock option grants can often be passed on to children or charities and are taxed at the time of purchase, depending on the specific price of the grant and the market value of the stock being granted.

Stock option grants are usually offered to employees after they have worked at the company for a set period of time. Each company decides how its grant program operates, but most of the time, employees must continue to work for the company and cannot exercise their granted options (sell their granted [shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp)) for a set period of time.

Moreover, grants usually follow a [vesting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp) schedule where rights to the financial rewards accrue over time. For example, an employee remains with the company and becomes 50% vested in the reward. At that point, the employee has [nonforfeitable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonforfeiture-clause.asp) rights to half the reward, even if employment is ended.

From the employer's standpoint, the idea behind stock option grants is to give employees the incentive to align their interests with that of the [shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp). From the employee's standpoint, a stock option grant is an opportunity to purchase stock in the company for which they work. Typically, the grant price is set as the [market price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) at the time the grant is offered.

If the market price of the stock goes up in value, the grant price is still the same and the employee is purchasing a stock at a lower price than market value when exercising the option. In this way, grants are similar to [call options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), but without an [expiration date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp).

## Qualified vs. Non-Qualified Stock Option Grants

A qualified stock option grant, also known as an [incentive stock option (ISO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iso.asp), is eligible for a special tax treatment: you don't have to pay income tax when you purchase an option, you instead pay [capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) when you sell the option, or taxes on the profits made from the stock option. However, the grant might not be provided at a lower price than market value, as non-qualified options are.

Also, a qualified stock option grant type is sometimes riskier, as the employee must hold on to the option for a longer period of time to qualify for special tax treatment. It is usually reserved for the higher-level employees, and the company cannot write it off as a tax deduction. ISOs cannot be transferred to another person or entity, unless through a will or trust.

[Non-qualified stock option (NSO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nso.asp) grants can be transferred to a child or a charity, depending on the specific company's policies. Non-qualified stock option grants are tax-deductible by the company that provides them. Since the grant is provided at a specific price, which is usually lower than the [market value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp) for the company's stock, employees who choose to take advantage of this opportunity pay income tax on the difference between these two prices upon purchase. It's important to note that employees are not subject to taxes when the option becomes available to them; instead, they only pay taxes when they purchase a stock option.
