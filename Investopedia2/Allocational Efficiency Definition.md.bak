Allocational Efficiency Definition
## What Is Allocational Efficiency?

Allocational efficiency, also known as allocative efficiency, is a characteristic of an [efficient market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp) where capital is assigned in a way that is most beneficial to the parties involved.

### Key Takeaways

-   Allocational, or allocative, efficiency is a property of an efficient market whereby all goods and services are optimally distributed among buyers in an economy.
-   It occurs when parties are able to use the accurate and readily available data reflected in the market to make decisions about how to utilize their resources.
-   In economics, the point of allocational efficiency for a product or service occurs at the price and quantity defined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves.
-   Allocational efficiency only holds if markets themselves are efficient, both informationally and transactionally.

## Understanding Allocational Efficiency

Allocational efficiency represents an optimal distribution of goods and services to consumers in an [economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp), as well as an optimal distribution of financial [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) to firms or projects among investors. Under allocational efficiency, all goods, services, and capital is allotted and distributed to its very best use.

By definition, efficiency means that capital is put to its optimal use and that there is no other distribution of capital that exists which would produce better outcomes.

Allocational efficiency occurs when organizations in the public and [private sectors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp) spend their resources on projects that will be the most profitable and do the most good for the population, thereby promoting [economic growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp). This is made possible when parties are able to use the accurate and readily available data reflected in the market to make decisions about how to utilize their resources.

When all of the data affecting a [market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp) is accessible, companies can make accurate decisions about what projects might be most profitable and manufacturers can concentrate on producing products that are most desired by the general population.

In economics, allocative efficiency materializes at the intersection of the [supply and demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp) curves. At this [equilibrium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp) point, the price offered for a given supply exactly matches the demand for that supply at that price, and so all products are sold.

## Requirements for Allocational Efficiency

In order to be allocationally efficient, a market must be efficient overall. An efficient market is one in which all pertinent data regarding the market and its activities is readily available to all market participants and is always reflected in [market prices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp).

For the market to be efficient, it must meet the prerequisites of being both [informationally efficient](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strongform.asp) and transactionally or [operationally efficient](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operationalefficiency.asp). When a market is informationally efficient, all necessary and pertinent information about the market is readily available to all parties involved in the market. In other words, no parties have an informational advantage over any other parties.

Meanwhile, when a market is transactionally efficient, all [transaction costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transactioncosts.asp) are reasonable and fair. This ensures that all transactions are equally executable by all parties and not prohibitively expensive to anyone.

If these conditions of fairness are met and the market is efficient, [capital flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-flows.asp) will direct themselves to the places where they will be the most effective, providing an optimal risk/reward scenario for investors.
