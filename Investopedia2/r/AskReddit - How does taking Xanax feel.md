r/AskReddit - How does taking Xanax feel?
Okay I also have a scrip for xanax so I hope I can help. I take it "as needed" but for me that's really rarely because I don't like the way it makes me feel in the longterm and I also don't like getting high off/addicted to drugs.

So the effects: 30 minutes, maybe less, after you take it, there's a relaxed euphoric feeling that washes over you. The first time I took it I felt _amazing_. I could actually breathe, eat, function, and it was brilliant. On top of that there was the buzz itself, but to be honest it's not that intense at low doses (I'm on .5mg). Now when I take it I get a slight buzz, but not high.

Another thing that you should know before taking it is that it will mess with your memory. When I first started taking xanax it I couldn't drive anywhere far because I would forget where I was going and miss turns, then realize I'd forgotten and turn around only to forget again. After a few days of taking it and now years later when I take it I don't get that memory loss very much.

The only time I take xanax now is when I'm unable to sleep due to anxiety (racing thoughts, heart pounding, upset stomach, etc) because it will make you tired and take away those symptoms a bit. Anxiety on the whole in my life still gets shitty but I try my best to avoid taking the xanax during the day because I'm afraid of that "oh no, emotions! better pop this pill!" mentality that'll turn you into a zombie in no time. I also don't like the after-high feeling which is like... if you take a nap and the rest of the day everything seems sorta fucked up in your body chemistry or something.

When I do take it to help me sleep I find that the next night I'm more anxious than the night before, and this will escalate if I take another pill because I need to sleep. But the cycle's breakable.

I got my first prescription from the emergency room because I was barely able to breathe. If you get like that, by all means take the pill. If you're just stressed, exercising may be able to take care of that. But if you have the pills, I would take one on a day where there's nothing else going on and just see what it feels like so that if a time comes when you do need to take it ever comes, you'll know what to expect and how to take care of yourself under the effects of the drug.

ed - Also, don't combine it with alcohol. Seriously. I almost ruined my life by doing this because I'm an idiot and thought it would be fun. Maybe it was fun at the time, I'll never know because xanax+drunk=complete blackout, but the consequences... definitely not worth it. So don't do it.
