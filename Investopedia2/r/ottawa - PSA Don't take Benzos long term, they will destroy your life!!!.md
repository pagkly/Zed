r/ottawa - PSA: Don't take Benzos long term, they will destroy your life!!!
I'm tapering off Klonopin, day 516 now, @ 52 years old, have been on it daily since 2014, it's been harrowing, and so much left to go , this is what I wrote to local news media, ( they never got back to me ) down to almost 0.3 mg's of Klonopin from original dose of 1.5 mg's

I am a sufferer of a class of medications called "Benzodiazepines," which include such common names, like Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, and Ativan. I have lost all quality of life because of this medication, which is really only intended for short term use, 2-4 weeks for anxiety disorders, or one off uses, at the dentist, or before a medical procedure etc...

I was not given "Informed Consent" from my psychiatrist that this class of meds could cause these severe problems, I've now been taking them 5 years, I took this medication from my psychiatrist, "As Prescribed" she, herself is now 6 months retired, my family Dr is trying to help me now. There is a name for this problem “Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome” otherwise known as "The Hidden Drug Crisis" this is a nasty drug/chemical induced brain injury. resulting in "Down Regulated GABA Receptors", I'm now on day 516 of a grueling taper , from Klonopin, using a DIY crude water taper, which isn't going well.... and is probably making me worse, but I'm really trying.. I have very people to help me. lots of talk about the New LRT, I'm like the human version of it, totally messed up..

There is a world wide Benzo support community that exists on Facebook, and the web with thousands upon thousands of sufferers struggling through brutal , long tapers, and withdrawals, often alone. there is no support locally for this problem, ( for sufferers) and most doctors don't understand Benzo Withdrawal Syndrome (BWS)

I have not left the house on my own accord, in 20 months now, due to Agoraphobia and crippling anxiety, that's been made 10 times worse, due to hitting tolerance, and now, tapering from this medication. I experience many severe debilitating physical/mental withdrawal symptoms, 24/7. this has been life changing and harrowing.
