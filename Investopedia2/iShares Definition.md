## The Basics of iShares

ETFs from iShares are a flexible, low-cost way for investors to gain exposure to various market segments, including fixed income, emerging markets and broad-based indexes. For example, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF ([IVV](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=ivv)) tracks the S&P 500 Index, whereas the iShares MSCI Emerging Market ETF ([EEM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=eem)) follows more than 800 large and [mid-cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/midcapstock.asp) companies in developing countries.3 4

By combining low fees with tax efficiency in an asset that seeks to match an index, ETFs can build greater longer term savings compared with mutual funds. Beyond savings, most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index, which means turnover is less frequent and thus fees are lower. However, this doesn't come at the expense of performance. In fact, iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their peers on average over the past five years.5   

Almost all major global marketplaces list iShares funds, including the London Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange, among others. At any given time, iShares and Vanguard represent more than 50% of the total ETF market.6
