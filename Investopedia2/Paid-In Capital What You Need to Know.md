Paid-In Capital: What You Need to Know
## What Is Additional Paid-In Capital?

Additional paid-in capital (APIC), is an accounting term referring to money an investor pays above and beyond the [par value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/par.asp) price of a stock. Often referred to as "[contributed capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contributed-capital.asp) in excess of par”, APIC occurs when an investor buys newly-issued shares, directly from a company, during its [initial public offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO) stage. Therefore, APICs, which are itemized under the “shareholder’s equity” section of a balance sheet, are viewed as profit opportunities for companies, who receive excess cash from stockholders.

**\[Important: Additional paid-in-capital is recorded at the initial public offering (IPO) only; the transactions that occur after the IPO do not increase the additional paid-in capital account.\]**

#### Additional Paid-In Capital

## How Does Additional Paid-In Capital Work?

### Investors may pay any amount greater than par

During its IPO, a firm is entitled to set any price for its stock that it sees fit. Meanwhile, [investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) may elect to pay any amount above this declared par value of a share price, which generates the additional paid-in capital.

Let us assume that during its IPO phase, the XYZ Widget Company issues one million shares of stock, with a par value of $1 per share, and that investors bid on shares for $2, $4, and $10 above the par value. Let us further assume that those shares ultimately sell for $11, consequently making the company $11 million. In this instance, the additional paid-in capital is $10 million ($11 million minus the par value of $1 million). Therefore, the company’s balance sheet itemizes $1 million as "paid-in-capital," and $10 million as "additional paid-in capital".

### And after the IPO?

Once a stock trades in the [secondary market](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/primary-and-secondary-markets/), an investor may pay whatever the market will bear. When investors buy shares directly from a given company, that corporation receives and retains the funds as paid-in-capital. But after that time, when investors buy shares in the [open market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp), the generated funds go directly into the pockets of the investors selling off their positions.

## Understanding Additional Paid-In Capital Further

### Adds to shareholders' equity

Additional paid-in capital is an accounting term, whose amount is generally booked in the shareholders' equity (SE) section of the balance sheet.

## Par value

Due to the fact that additional paid-in capital represents money paid to the company, above the par value of a security, it is essential to understand what par actually means. Simply put, “par” signifies the value a company assigns to stock at the time of its IPO, before there is even a market for the security. Issuers traditionally set stock par values deliberately low—in some cases as little as a penny per share, in order to preemptively avoid any potential legal liability, which might occur if the stock dips below its par value.

## Market value

Market value is the actual price a financial instrument is worth at any given time. The stock market determines the real value of a stock, which shifts continuously, as shares are bought and sold throughout the trading day. Thus, investors make money on the [changing value](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/155.asp) of a stock over time, based on company performance and investor sentiment.

## _Key Takeaways_

-   _Additional paid-in capital is the difference between the par value of a stock and the price that investors actually pay for it._
-   _To be "additional" paid-in capital, an investor must buy the stock directly from the company at its IPO._
-   _The additional paid-in capital is usually booked as shareholders' equity on the balance sheet._

## Why Is Additional Paid-In Capital Important?

For common stock, [paid-in-capital](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/abcs-of-private-equity.asp) consists of a stock's par value and additional paid-in capital--the latter of which may provide a substantial portion of a company's equity capital, before retained earnings begin to accumulate. This capital provides a layer of defense against potential losses, in the event that retained earnings begin to show a deficit.
