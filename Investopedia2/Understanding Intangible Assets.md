Understanding Intangible Assets
## What Is an Intangible Asset?

An intangible asset is an asset that is not physical in nature. [Goodwill](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100614/goodwill-vs-other-intangible-assets-whats-difference.asp), brand recognition and [intellectual property](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intellectualproperty.asp), such as patents, [trademarks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trademark.asp), and copyrights, are all intangible assets. Intangible assets [exist in opposition to tangible assets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012815/what-difference-between-tangible-and-intangible-assets.asp), which include land, vehicles, equipment, and inventory.

Additionally, financial assets such as stocks and bonds, which derive their value from contractual claims, are considered tangible assets.

#### What are Intangible Assets?

### Key Takeaways

-   An intangible asset is an asset that is not physical in nature, such as a patent, brand, trademark, or copyright.
-   Businesses can create or acquire intangible assets.
-   An intangible asset can be considered indefinite (a brand name, for example) or definite, like a legal agreement or contract.
-   Intangible assets created by a company do not appear on the balance sheet and have no recorded book value. 

## Understanding an Intangible Asset

An intangible asset can be classified as either indefinite or definite. A company's brand name is considered an indefinite intangible asset because it stays with the company for as long as it continues operations. An example of a definite intangible asset would be a legal agreement to operate under another company's patent, with no plans of extending the agreement. The agreement thus has a limited life and is classified as a definite asset.

While an intangible asset doesn't have the obvious physical value of a factory or equipment, it can prove valuable for a firm and be critical to its long-term success or failure.

For example, a business such as Coca-Cola wouldn't be nearly as successful if it not for the money made through [brand recognition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp).1 Although brand recognition is not a physical asset that can be seen or touched, it can have a meaningful impact on generating sales.

### Valuing Intangible Assets 

Businesses can create or acquire intangible assets. For example, a business may create a mailing list of clients or establish a patent. If a business creates an intangible asset, it can write off the expenses from the process, such as filing the patent application, hiring a lawyer, and paying other related costs.

In addition, all the expenses along the way of creating the intangible asset are expensed. However, intangible assets created by a company do not appear on the balance sheet and have no recorded book value. Because of this, when a company is purchased, often the purchase price is above the [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp) of assets on the [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp). The purchasing company records the premium paid as an intangible asset on its balance sheet.

## Example of Intangible Assets

Intangible assets only appear on the balance sheet if they have been acquired. If Company ABC purchases a patent from Company XYZ for an agreed-upon amount of $1 billion, then Company ABC would record a transaction for $1 billion in intangible assets that would appear under long-term assets.

The $1-billion asset would then be written off over a number of years via [amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-are-differences-between-amortization-and-impairment.asp). Indefinite life intangible assets, such as goodwill, are not amortized. Rather, these assets are assessed each year for impairment, which is when the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value.
