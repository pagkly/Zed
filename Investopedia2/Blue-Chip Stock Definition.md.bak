Blue-Chip Stock Definition
## What is a Blue-Chip Stock?

A blue-chip stock is a huge company with an excellent reputation. These are typically large, well-established and financially sound companies that have operated for many years and that have dependable earnings, often paying dividends to investors. A blue-chip stock typically has a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) in the billions, is generally the [market leader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-leader.asp) or among the top three companies in its sector, and is more often than not a household name. For all of these reasons, blue-chip stocks are among the most popular to buy among investors. Some examples of blue-chip stocks are IBM Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and Boeing Co.

## Understanding a Blue-Chip Stock

While [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) payments are not absolutely necessary for a stock to be considered a blue chip, most blue chips have long records of paying stable or rising dividends. The term is believed to have been derived from poker, where [blue chips](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031915/what-qualifies-company-blue-chip.asp) are the most expensive chips.

A blue-chip stock is generally a component of the most reputable market indexes or averages, such as the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp), the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 and the Nasdaq-100 in the United States, the TSX-60 in Canada or the [FTSE](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ftse.asp) Index in the United Kingdom.

How big a company needs to be to qualify for blue-chip status is open to debate. A generally accepted benchmark is a market capitalization of $5 billion, although market or sector leaders can be companies of all sizes. The T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund doesn't have a specific guideline for what type of company qualifies outside of focusing on large-cap and mid-cap companies that are well-established in their industries, although the median market cap of the fund's holdings has historically been in the range of close to $100 billion.1

### Key Takeaways

-   Blue-chip stocks are huge companies with excellent reputations, often including some of the biggest household names.
-   Investors turn to blue-chip stocks because they have dependable financials and often pay dividends.
-   There is a perception among investors that blue-chips can survive market challenges of many kinds; while this may be largely true, it is not a guarantee. For this reason, it's crucial to diversify a portfolio beyond only blue-chip stocks.

## The Safety of Blue-Chip Stocks

While a blue-chip company may have survived several challenges and [market cycles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market_cycles.asp), leading to it being perceived as a safe investment, this may not always be the case. The [bankruptcies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) of General Motors and [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp), as well as a number of leading European banks during the [global recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/global-recession.asp) of 2008, is proof that even the best companies may struggle during periods of extreme stress.

## Blue Chips as Part of a Larger Portfolio

While blue-chip stocks are appropriate for use as core holdings within a larger portfolio, they generally shouldn't be the entire portfolio. A diversified portfolio usually contains some allocation to bonds and cash. Within a portfolio's allocation to stocks, an investor should consider owning mid-caps and small-caps as well. Younger investors can generally tolerate the risk that comes from having a greater percentage of their portfolios in stocks, including blue chips, while older investors may choose to focus more on capital preservation through larger investments in bonds and cash.
