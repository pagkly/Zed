## Special Considerations

The Inter-American Development Bank has 584 projects.4 Past projects that have been completed include those with Daycoval, Banco Industrial do Brasil, Banco Industrial, Exchange of Experiences in State Budget Management, and Banco Internacional de Costa Rica S.A. (BICSA). The bank’s current goals include focusing on social inclusion, economic integration, and innovation. As well, it’s interested in climate change, gender issues, and diversity.

When he was president of the IAB, Luis Alberto Moreno said the focus of the bank included tackling inequality and improving public services for the countries it serves. Change is needed, said Moreno, pointing to the various protests in the streets within the region during 2019. Moreno pointed out the lack of growth in Latin America since 2014—the end of the commodity boom. Since then, the region has experienced the worst economic growth in the world.

In September 2020, Mauricio J. Claver-Carone was elected President of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) during an electronic meeting of the Bank’s Board of Governors. Claver-Carone took office on October 1, 2020, for a five-year term. Previously, Claver-Carone was Deputy Assistant to the Former U.S. President Donald Trump and Senior Director for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the U.S. National Security Council. He has also served as Senior Advisor to the Under Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.5
