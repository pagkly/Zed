Understanding the Calm Waters of Blue Ocean Market Opportunities
## What Is Blue Ocean?

Blue ocean is a slang term created in 2005. The idea behind it is the referral to the vast marketing options that occurs when an unknown industry or innovation occurs.

The term blue ocean was coined by professors W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne in their book [_Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant (2005)_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625274491/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0). The authors define blue oceans as markets associated with high potential profits.

Business leaders with innovative products and services who can identify blue ocean markets have endless opportunities

## How Blue Ocean Works

In an established industry, companies compete with each other for every piece of available [market share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp). The competition is often so intense that some [firms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firm.asp) cannot sustain themselves. This type of industry describes a red ocean, representing a [saturated market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsaturation.asp) share bloodied by competition. Blue oceans offer the opposite. Many firms choose to innovate or expand in the hopes of finding a blue ocean market with uncontested competition. Blue ocean markets are also of high interest to entrepreneurs.

## Examples of Blue Ocean Strategies

Ford ([F](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=f)) and Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)) are two examples of leading companies that created their blue oceans by pursuing high product differentiation at a relatively low cost, which also raised the barriers for competition.

### Ford Motor Co.

In 1908, Ford Motor Co. introduced the Model T as the car for the masses. It only came in one color and one model, but it was reliable, durable, and affordable. At the time, the automobile industry was still in its infancy with approximately 500 automakers producing custom-made cars that were more expensive and less reliable. Ford created a new manufacturing process for mass-producing standardized cars at a fraction of the price of its competitors. The Model T's market share jumped from 9% in 1908 to 61% in 1921, also officially replacing the horse-drawn carriage as the principal mode of transportation.

### Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. found a blue ocean with its iTunes music download service. While billions of music files were being downloaded each month illegally, Apple created the first legal format for downloading music in 2003. It was easy to use, providing users with the ability to buy individual songs at a reasonable price. Apple won over millions of music listeners who had been pirating music by offering higher-quality sound along with search and navigation functions. Apple made iTunes a win-win-win for the music producers, music listeners, and Apple by creating a new stream of revenue from a new market while providing more convenient access to music.
