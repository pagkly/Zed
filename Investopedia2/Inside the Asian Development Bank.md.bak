Inside the Asian Development Bank
## What Is the Asian Development Bank?

Founded in 1966, the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) headquarters are in Manila, Philippines. The Asian Development Bank's primary mission is to foster growth and cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific Region. 

It has been responsible for a number of major projects in the region and raises capital through the international [bond markets](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/centuryofbonds.asp). The ADB also relies on member contributions, retained earnings from lending, and the repayment of loans for funding of the organization.

The two largest shareholders of the Asian Development Bank are the United States and Japan. 

## How the Asian Development Bank Works

The Asian Development Bank provides assistance to its developing member countries, the private sector, and [public-private partnerships](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-private-partnerships.asp) through grants, loans, technical assistance, and equity investments to promote development. The ADB regularly facilitates policy dialogues and provides advisory services. They also use co-financing operations that tap a number of official, commercial, and export credit sources while providing assistance.
