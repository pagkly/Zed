Cash Flow From Investing Activities
## What Is Cash Flow from Investing Activities?

Cash flow from investing activities is one of the sections on the cash flow statement that reports how much cash has been generated or spent from various investment-related activities in a specific period. Investing activities include purchases of physical assets, investments in securities, or the sale of securities or assets.

Negative cash flow is often indicative of a company's poor performance. However, negative cash flow from investing activities might be due to significant amounts of cash being invested in the long-term health of the company, such as research and development.

## Understanding Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Before analyzing the different types of positive and negative cash flows from investing activities, it's important to review where a company's investment activity falls within its financial statements. There are three main financial statements: the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

The balance sheet provides an overview of a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's equity as of a specific date. The income statement provides an overview of company revenues and expenses during a period. The cash flow statement bridges the gap between the income statement and the balance sheet by showing how much cash is generated or spent on operating, investing, and financing activities for a specific period.

### Key Takeaways

## Cash Flow from Investing

Cash flows from investing activities provides an account of cash used in the purchase of [non-current assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncurrent-assets.asp)–or long-term assets– that will deliver value in the future. 

Investing activity is an important aspect of growth and capital. A change to [property, plant, and equipment (PPE),](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppe.asp) a large line item on the balance sheet, is considered an investing activity. When investors and analysts want to know how much a company spends on PPE, they can look for the sources and uses of funds in the investing section of the cash flow statement.

Capital expenditures (CapEx), also found in this section, is a popular measure of capital investment used in the valuation of stocks. An increase in capital expenditures means the company is investing in future operations. However, capital expenditures are a reduction in cash flow. Typically, companies with a significant amount of capital expenditures are in a state of growth.

Below are a few examples of cash flows from investing activities along with whether the items generate negative or positive cash flow.

-   Purchase of [fixed assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp)–cash flow negative
-   Purchase of investments such as stocks or securities–cash flow negative
-   Lending money–cash flow negative
-   Sale of fixed assets–cash flow positive
-   Sale of investment securities–cash flow positive
-   Collection of loans and insurance proceeds–cash flow positive

If a company has differences in the values of its non-current assets from period-to-period (on the balance sheet), it might mean there's investing activity on the cash flow statement.
