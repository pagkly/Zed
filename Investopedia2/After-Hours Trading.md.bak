After-Hours Trading
## What Is After-Hours Trading?

After-hours trading starts at 4 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time after the major U.S. stock exchanges close. The after-hours trading session can run as late as 8 p.m., though volume typically thins out much earlier in the session. Trading in the after-hours is conducted through [electronic communication networks (ECNs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecn.asp).

#### What's After-Hours Trading?

### Key Takeaways

-   After-hours trading starts at 4 p.m. and ends at around 8 p.m.
-   Stocks are not as liquid during after-hours trading.
-   The spread between the bid and the ask may be wider in after-hours trading.

## Understanding After-Hours Trading

### The Spark

[After-hours trading is something traders or investors can use if news breaks after the close of the stock exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/saleafterhours.asp). In some cases, the news, such as an earnings release, may prompt an investor to either buy or sell a stock.

### Volume

The [volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) for a stock may spike on the initial release of the news but most of the time thins out as the session progresses. The amount of volume generally slows significantly by 6 p.m. There is a substantial risk when trading in illiquid stocks after-hours. 

### Price

Not only does volume sometimes come at a premium in the after-hours trading sessions but so does price. It is not unusual for the spreads to be wide in the after-hours. The [spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp) is the difference between the bid and the ask prices. Due to fewer shares trading, the spread may be significantly wider than during the normal trading session.

### Participation

If liquidity and prices weren’t enough of a reason to make after-hours trading risky, the lack of participants makes it even riskier. In some cases, certain investors or institutions may choose simply not to participate in [after-hours trading](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050313/activities-you-can-take-advantage-premarket-and-afterhours-trading-sessions.asp), regardless of the news or the event.

This means that it is quite possible for a stock to fall sharply in the after-hours only to rise once the regular trading session resumes the next day at 9:30 a.m., should many big institutional investors have a different view of the price action during the after-hours trading session.

Because volume is thin and spreads are wide in after-hours trading it is much easier to push prices higher or lower, requiring fewer shares to make a substantial impact. Since after-hours trading can have a significant impact on a [stock's price](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/saleafterhours.asp), it's not a bad idea to put a limit order on any shares you intend to buy or sell outside of regular trading periods.

## Real-World Example of After-Hours Trading

Nvidia Corp. ([NVDA](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=nvda)) earnings results in February 2019 are an excellent example of how after-hours trading works and the dangers that come with it. Nvidia reported quarterly results on February 14.1 The stock was greeted by a big jump in price, rising to nearly $169 from $154.50 in the 10 minutes following the news.

As the chart shows, volume was steady in the first 10 minutes and then dropped quickly after 4:30 p.m. During the first 5 minutes of trading, around 700,000 shares traded and the stock jumped nearly 6%. However, volume slowed materially with just 350,000 shares trading between 4:25 and 4:30. By 5 p.m., the amount of volume trading slowed to only 100,000 shares, while the stock was still trading around $165.

However, the next morning was a different story, which was when all the market participants had a chance to weigh in on Nvidia’s results. From 9:30 a.m. 9:35 a.m., nearly 2.3 million shares traded, more than three times greater than the volume in the initial minutes of the previous day's after-hours, and the price dropped from $164 to $161.

The stock proceeded to trade lower throughout the rest of the day, closing at $157.20. That was just $3 higher than the previous day's close, after being up nearly $15 in the after-hours session. Nearly all of the after-hours gains had evaporated.
