Aptitude Test: Know Your Skills
## What Is an Aptitude Test?

An aptitude test is an exam used to determine an individual's skill or propensity to succeed in a given activity. Aptitude tests assume that individuals have inherent strengths and weaknesses, and have a natural inclination toward success or failure in specific areas based on their innate characteristics.

Note that an aptitude test does not test knowledge or intelligence; only a particular skill or propensity. Therefore, it is not a test for which a person can study.

### Key Takeaways

-   An aptitude test is used to determine an individual's ability, assessing how they are likely to perform in an area in which they have no prior training or knowledge.
-   Schools use aptitude tests to determine if students are inclined toward advanced placement classes or certain areas of study, like engineering or a foreign language.
-   In the work world, human resources departments at some companies will use career assessment tests to learn about a potential candidate's strengths and weaknesses.

Aptitude tests, as well as personality tests, can be useful in determining skills and abilities to highlight on a resume or cover letter when applying for a job.

## Educational Aptitude Tests

Some schools administer aptitude tests to students beginning in elementary school. Along with intelligence tests and achievement tests that measure student mastery of academic content, aptitude tests may be used to determine placement in gifted and talented programs or other specific educational tracks. For example, the Modern Language Aptitude Test measures a student's potential for successfully mastering foreign languages. Aptitude tests can also help determine if a student needs special education services.

For older students, Differential Aptitude Tests assess a range of aptitudes from spatial relations to language usage. The results can help administrators make curricular recommendations. Counselors might use high scores in a test in mechanical reasoning, for example, to guide a student toward courses that prepare them for engineering or designing studies in college. Students who score well in tests measuring speed, accuracy, and problem solving might decide to choose coursework in computer science, [finance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finance.asp), or other fields requiring attention to detail.
