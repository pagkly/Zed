What is a Blue Chip?
## What Is a Blue Chip?

A blue chip is a nationally recognized, well-established, and financially sound company. Blue chips generally sell high-quality, widely accepted products and services. Blue-chip companies are known to weather downturns and operate profitably in the face of adverse economic conditions, which helps to contribute to their long record of stable and reliable growth.

### Key Takeaways

-   A blue chip refers to an established, stable, and well-recognized corporation.
-   Blue-chip stocks are seen as relatively safer investments, with a proven track record of success and stable growth.
-   Blue-chip stocks are still nonetheless subject to volatility and failure, such as with the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the impact of the financial crisis on General Motors.

## Understanding Blue Chips

The term "blue chip" was first used to describe high-priced stocks in 1923 when Oliver Gingold, an employee at Dow Jones, observed certain stocks trading at $200 or more per share.1 Poker players bet in blue, white, and red chips with the blue chips having more value than both red and white chips. Today, blue-chip stocks don’t necessarily refer to stocks with a high price tag, but more accurately to stocks of high-quality companies that have withstood the test of time.

A blue-chip stock is generally a component of the most reputable market indexes or averages, such as the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp), the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 and the Nasdaq-100 in the United States, the TSX-60 in Canada, or the [FTSE](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ftse.asp) Index in the United Kingdom. How big a company needs to be to qualify for blue-chip status is open to debate. A generally accepted benchmark is a market capitalization of $5 billion, although market or sector leaders can be companies of all sizes.2 

A blue-chip company is a multinational firm that has been in operation for a number of years. Think companies like Coca-Cola, Disney, PepsiCo, Walmart, General Electric, IBM, and McDonald’s, which are dominant leaders in their respective industries. Blue-chip companies have built a reputable [brand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand.asp) over the years and the fact that they have survived multiple [downturns in the economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp) makes them stable companies to have in a portfolio.2

The name "blue chip" came about from the game of poker in which the blue chips have the highest value.

Many [Conservative investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conservativeinvesting.asp) with a [low risk profile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-profile.asp) or nearing retirement may usually go for blue-chip stocks. These stocks are great for [capital preservation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preservationofcapital.asp) and their consistent [dividend payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) not only provide income, but also protect the portfolio against inflation. In his book _The Intelligent Investor_, Benjamin Graham points out that conservative investors should look for companies that have consistently paid dividends for 20 years or more.3

The [Dividend Aristocrat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend-aristocrat.asp) List published by Standard and Poor’s comprises of [large-cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp) blue-chip companies from the S&P 500 that have increased dividends every year for the last 25 years.4

## Blue Chip Stock Characteristics

Blue-chip stocks are seen as less [volatile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) investments than owning shares in companies without blue-chip status because blue chips have an institutional status in the economy. The stocks are highly [liquid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) since they are frequently traded in the market by individual and institutional investors alike. Therefore, investors who need cash on a whim can confidently create a sell order for their stock knowing that there will always be a buyer on the other end of the transaction.

Blue-chip companies are also characterized as having little to no debt, large [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp), stable [debt-to-equity ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp), and [high return on equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) (ROE) and [return on assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp) (ROA). The solid [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) fundamentals coupled with high liquidity have earned all blue-chip stocks the [investment-grade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentgrade.asp) bond ratings. While [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) payments are not absolutely necessary for a stock to be considered a blue chip, most blue chips have long records of paying stable or rising dividends.

An investor can track the performance of blue-chip stocks through a [blue-chip index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blue-chip-index.asp), which can also be used as an indicator of industry or economy performance. Most publicly traded blue-chip stocks are included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), one of the most popular blue-chip indices. Although changes made to the DJIA index are rare, an investor tracking blue chips should always monitor the DJIA to stay up to date with any changes made.5

## Blue-Chip Stocks' Safety

While a blue-chip company may have survived several challenges and [market cycles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market_cycles.asp), leading to it being perceived as a safe investment, this may not always be the case. The [bankruptcies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) of General Motors and [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp), as well as a number of leading European banks during the [global recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/global-recession.asp) of 2008, is proof that even the best companies may struggle during periods of extreme stress.6

While [blue-chip stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031915/what-qualifies-company-blue-chip.asp) are appropriate for use as core holdings within a larger portfolio, they generally shouldn't be the entire portfolio. A diversified portfolio usually contains some allocation to bonds and cash. Within a portfolio's allocation to stocks, an investor should consider owning mid-caps and small-caps as well.

Younger investors can generally tolerate the risk that comes from having a greater percentage of their portfolios in stocks, including blue chips, while older investors may choose to focus more on capital preservation through larger investments in bonds and cash.
