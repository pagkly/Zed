Many find by sharing business performance better, it becomes a sustainable growth and competitive differentiation strategy.

## Types of Assurance Services

Below is a list of the most common assurance services.

### Risk Assessment

Entities are subjected to greater risks and more precipitous changes in fortune than ever before. Managers and investors are concerned about whether entities have identified the full scope of these risks and taken precautions to mitigate them. This service assures that an entity's profile of business risks is comprehensive and evaluates whether the entity has appropriate systems in place to effectively manage those risks.

### Business Performance Measurement

Investors and managers demand a more comprehensive information base than just financial statements; they need a "balanced scorecard." This service evaluates whether an entity's performance measurement system contains relevant and reliable measures for assessing the degree to which the entity's goals and objectives are achieved or how its performance compares to its competitors.

### Information Systems Reliability

Managers and other employees are more dependent on good information than ever and are increasingly demanding it online. It must be right in real-time. The focus must be on systems that are reliable by design, not correcting the data after the fact. This service assesses whether an entity's internal information systems (financial and non-financial) provide reliable information for operating and financial decisions.

### Electronic Commerce

The growth of [electronic commerce](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecommerce.asp) has been hindered by a lack of confidence in the systems. This service assesses whether systems and tools used in electronic commerce provide appropriate data integrity, security, privacy, and reliability.

As a result, healthcare recipients and their employers are increasingly concerned about the quality and availability of healthcare services. This service provides assurance about the effectiveness of healthcare services provided by HMOs, hospitals, doctors, and other providers.
