CRPCs are focused on retirement planning. The CRPC program is developed with a focus on client-centered problem-solving.

The College for Financial Planning describes the program as helping financial planners and advisers define and create a "road map for retirement" for their clients.2 The study program to become a CRPC covers the entire [retirement planning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement-planning.asp) process, including meeting multiple financial objectives, sources of retirement income, personal savings, employer-sponsored retirement plans, [income taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp), retirement cash flow, [asset management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetmanagement.asp), [estate planning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp), and more.
