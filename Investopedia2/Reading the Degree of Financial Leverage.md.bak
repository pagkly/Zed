Reading the Degree of Financial Leverage
## What Is a Degree of Financial Leverage - DFL?

A degree of financial leverage (DFL) is a [leverage ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverageratio.asp) that measures the sensitivity of a company’s earnings per share (EPS) to fluctuations in its operating income, as a result of changes in its capital structure. The degree of financial leverage (DFL) measures the percentage change in EPS for a unit change in [operating income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp), also known as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

This ratio indicates that the higher the degree of financial leverage, the more volatile earnings will be. Since interest is usually a fixed expense, leverage magnifies returns and EPS. This is good when operating income is rising, but it can be a problem when operating income is under pressure.

## The Formula for DFL Is

DFL\=%change in EPS%change in EBIT\\text{DFL}=\\frac{\\%\\text{change in EPS}}{\\%\\text{change in EBIT}}

DFL can also be represented by the equation below:

DFL\=EBITEBIT − Interest\\text{DFL}=\\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{EBIT }-\\text{ Interest}}

#### Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL)

## What Does Degree of Financial Leverage Tell You?

The higher the DFL, the more volatile [earnings per share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS) will be. Since interest is a fixed expense, leverage magnifies returns and EPS, which is good when [operating income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp) is rising but can be a problem during tough economic times when operating income is under pressure.

DFL is invaluable in helping a company assess the amount of debt or financial leverage it should opt for in its [capital structure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp). If operating income is relatively stable, then earnings and EPS would be stable as well, and the company can afford to take on a significant amount of debt. However, if the company operates in a sector where operating income is quite volatile, it may be prudent to limit [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/12/good-debt-bad-debt.asp) to easily manageable levels.

The use of financial leverage varies greatly by industry and by the business sector. There are many industry sectors in which companies operate with a high degree of financial leverage. Retail stores, airlines, grocery stores, [utility companies](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022516/worlds-top-10-utility-companies.asp), and banking institutions are classic examples. Unfortunately, the excessive use of financial leverage by many companies in these sectors has played a paramount role in forcing a lot of them to file for [Chapter 11](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chapter11.asp) bankruptcy.

Examples include R.H. Macy (1992), Trans World Airlines (2001), Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co (A&P) (2010) and Midwest Generation (2012). Moreover, excessive use of financial leverage was the primary culprit that led to the U.S. [financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp) between 2007 and 2009. The [demise of Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/lehman-brothers-collapse.asp) (2008) and a host of other highly levered financial institutions are prime examples of the negative ramifications that are associated with the use of highly levered capital structures.

### Key Takeaways

-   The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is a leverage ratio that measures the sensitivity of a company’s earnings per share to fluctuations in its operating income, as a result of changes in its capital structure.
-   This ratio indicates that the higher the degree of financial leverage, the more volatile earnings will be.
-   The use of financial leverage varies greatly by industry and by the business sector.

## Example of How to Use DFL

Consider the following example to illustrate the concept. Assume hypothetical company BigBox Inc. has operating income or [earnings before interest and taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT) of $100 million in Year 1, with [interest expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp) of $10 million, and has 100 million shares outstanding. (For the sake of clarity, let’s ignore the effect of taxes for the moment.)

EPS for BigBox in Year 1 would thus be:

Operating Income of $100 Million − $10 Million Interest Expense100 Million Shares Outstanding\=$0.90\\frac{\\text{Operating Income of \\$100 Million }-\\text{ \\$10 Million Interest Expense}}{\\text{100 Million Shares Outstanding}}=\\$0.90

The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is:

$100 Million$100 Million − $10 Million\=1.11\\frac{\\text{\\$100 Million}}{\\text{\\$100 Million }-\\text{ \\$10 Million}}=1.11

This means that for every 1% change in EBIT or operating income, EPS would change by 1.11%.

Now assume that BigBox has a 20% increase in operating income in Year 2. Notably, interest expenses remain unchanged at $10 million in Year 2 as well. EPS for BigBox in Year 2 would thus be:

Operating Income of $120 Million − $10 Million Interest Expense100 Million Shares Outstanding\=$1.10\\frac{\\text{Operating Income of \\$120 Million }-\\text{ \\$10 Million Interest Expense}}{\\text{100 Million Shares Outstanding}}=\\$1.10

In this instance, EPS has increased from 90 cents in Year 1 to $1.10 in Year 2, which represents a change of 22.2%.

This could also be obtained from the DFL number = 1.11 x 20% (EBIT change) = 22.2%.

If EBIT had decreased instead to $70 million in Year 2, what would have been the impact on EPS? EPS would have declined by 33.3% (i.e., DFL of 1.11 x -30% change in EBIT). This can be easily verified since EPS, in this case, would have been 60 cents, which represents a 33.3% decline.
