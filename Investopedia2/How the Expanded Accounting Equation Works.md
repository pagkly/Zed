How the Expanded Accounting Equation Works
## What Is the Expanded Accounting Equation?

The expanded accounting equation is derived from the common [accounting equation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-equation.asp) and illustrates in greater detail the different components of [stockholder equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockholdersequity.asp) in a company.

By decomposing equity into component parts, analysts can get a better idea of how profits are being used—as dividends, reinvested into the company, or retained as cash.

### Key Takeaways

-   The expanded accounting equation is the same as the common accounting equation but decomposes equity into component parts.
-   The components of equity include contributed capital, retained earnings, and revenue minus dividends.
-   Total assets and total liabilities are also accounted for.

## The Formula for the Expanded Accounting Equation Is

The expanded version of the accounting equation details the equity role in the basic accounting equation:

Assets\=Liabilities+Owner’s Equitywhere:Liabilities\=All current and long-term debtsand obligationsOwner’s Equity\=Assets available to shareholdersafter all liabilities\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Assets} = \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{Owner's Equity}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{Liabilities} = \\text{All current and long-term debts} \\\\ &\\text{and obligations}\\\\ &\\text{Owner's Equity} = \\text{Assets available to shareholders} \\\\ &\\text{after all liabilities}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

Here is the expanded accounting equation:

Assets\=Liabilities+CC+BRE+R−E−Dwhere:CC\=Contributed Capital, capital provided bythe original stockholders (also known as Paid-In Capital)BRE\=Beginning Retained Earnings, earnings notdistributed to stockholders from the previous periodR\=Revenue, what’s generated from the ongoingoperation of the companyE\=Expenses, costs incurred to run operations ofthe businessD\=Dividends, earnings distributed to the stockholdersof the company\\begin{aligned}&\\text{Assets} = \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{CC} + \\text{BRE} + \\text{R} - \\text{E} - \\text{D} \\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&\\text{CC} = \\text{Contributed Capital, capital provided by} \\\\&\\text{the original stockholders (also known as Paid-In Capital)} \\\\&\\text{BRE} = \\text{Beginning Retained Earnings, earnings not} \\\\&\\text{distributed to stockholders from the previous period} \\\\&\\text{R} = \\text{Revenue, what's generated from the ongoing} \\\\&\\text{operation of the company} \\\\&\\text{E} = \\text{Expenses, costs incurred to run operations of} \\\\&\\text{the business} \\\\&\\text{D} = \\text{Dividends, earnings distributed to the stockholders} \\\\&\\text{of the company}\\end{aligned}

## How the Expanded Accounting Equation Works

Sometimes, analysts want to better understand the composition of a company's shareholders' equity. Besides assets and liabilities, which are part of the general accounting equation, stockholders' equity is expanded into the following elements:

-   _**Contributed capital**_ is the capital provided by the original stockholders (also known as [Paid-In Capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paidincapital.asp)).
-   _**Beginning retained earnings**_ are the earnings not distributed to the stockholders from the previous period.
-   _**Revenue**_ is what's generated from the ongoing operation of the company.
-   _**Expenses**_ are those costs incurred to run operations of the business_._
-   _**Dividends**_ are subtracted since they are the earnings distributed to the stockholders of the company.

[Contributed capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contributed-capital.asp) and dividends show the effect of transactions with the stockholders. The difference between the revenue and profit generated and expenses and losses incurred reflects the effect of [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) for stockholders' equity. Overall, then, the expanded accounting equation is useful in identifying at a basic level how stockholders' equity in a firm changes from period to period.

Some terminology may vary depending on the type of entity structure. "Members' Capital" and "Owners' Capital" are commonly used for partnerships and [sole proprietorships](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soleproprietorship.asp), respectively, while "distributions" and "withdrawals" are substitute nomenclature for "dividends."

## Real-World Example of the Expanded Accounting Equation

Below is a portion of Exxon Mobil Corporation's [(XOM)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=xom) [balance sheet](https://ir.exxonmobil.com/sec-filings?c=115024&p=irol-sec) as of September 30, 2018. 

-   Total assets were $354,628 (highlighted in green).
-   Total liabilities were $157,797 (1st highlighted red area).
-   Total equity was $196,831 (2nd highlighted red area).

The accounting equation whereby Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' equity is calculated as follows:

-   **Accounting equation** = $157,797 (total liabilities) + $196,831 (equity) equal $354,628, which equals the total assets for the period.

We could also use the expanded accounting equation to see the effect of reinvested earnings ($419,155), other comprehensive income ($18,370) and treasury stock ($225,674). We could also look to XOM's income statement to identify the amount of revenues and dividends the company earned and paid out.
