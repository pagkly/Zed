EBITDA-To-Interest Coverage Ratio
## What Is the EBITDA-to-Interest Coverage Ratio?

The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is a financial ratio that is used to assess a company's financial durability by examining whether it is at least profitable enough to pay off its interest expenses using its pre-tax income. Specifically it looks to see what proportion of [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp) (EBITDA), can be used for this purpose.

The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is also known simply as as EBITDA coverage. The main difference between EBITDA coverage and the [interest coverage ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestcoverageratio.asp), is that the latter uses [earnings before income and taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT), rather than the more encompassing EBITDA.

-   The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio, or EBITDA coverage, is used to see how easily a firm can pay the interest on its outstanding debt.
-   The formula divides earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization by total interest payments, making it more inclusive than the standard interest coverage ratio.
-   A higher coverage ratio is better, although the ideal ratio may vary by industry.

## Understanding the EBITDA-to-Interest Coverage Ratio

The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio was first widely used by [leveraged buyout](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp) bankers, who would use it as a first screen to determine whether a newly restructured company would be able to service its [short-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp) obligations. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the company has more than enough interest coverage to pay off its interest expenses.

While the ratio is a very easy way to assess whether a company can cover its interest-related expenses, the applications of this ratio are also limited by the relevance of using EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) as a proxy for various financial figures. For example, suppose that a company has an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of 1.25; this may not mean that it would be able to cover its interest payments since the company might need to spend a large portion of its profits on replacing old equipment. Because EBITDA does not account for depreciation-related expenses, a ratio of 1.25 might not be a definitive indicator of financial durability.

## EBITDA-To-Interest Coverage Ratio Calculation and Example

There are two formulas used for the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio that differ slightly. Analysts may differ in opinion on which one is more applicable to use depending on the company being analyzed. They are as follows:

> EBITDA-to-interest coverage = (EBITDA + lease payments) / (loan interest payments + lease payments)

and

> Interest coverage ratio, which is EBIT / interest expenses.

As an example, consider the following. A company reports sales revenue of $1,000,000. Salary expenses are reported as $250,000, while utilities are reported as $20,000. Lease payments are $100,000. The company also reports [depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) of $50,000 and [interest expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp) of $120,000. To calculate the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio, first an analyst needs to calculate the EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated by taking the company's [EBIT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (earnings before interest and tax) and adding back the depreciation and amortization amounts.

In the above example, the company's EBIT and EBITDA are calculated as:

-   EBIT = revenues - operating expenses - depreciation = $1,000,000 - ($250,000 + $20,000 + $100,000) - $50,000 = $580,000
-   EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation + amortization = $580,000 + $50,000 + $0 = $630,000

Next, using the formula for EBITDA-to-interest coverage that includes the lease payments term, the company's EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is:

-   EBITDA-to-interest coverage = ($630,000 + $100,000) / ($120,000 + $100,000)
-   \= $730,000 / $220,000
-   \= 3.32
