# Chrome Extension for Downloading Videos

## About
A chrome extension that looks into the current page for URLs of video files.

Once it finds them, it allows the user to download the videos or open them in
a new tab (which, in the more exotic cases, also defaults to download
instead of play).

The file extensions that it looks for are:
`3g2, 3gp, 3gpp, asf, avi, divx, f4v, flv,
h264, ifo, m2ts, m4v, mkv, mod, mov, mp4,
mpeg, mpg, mswmm, mts, mxf, ogv, rm, swf,
ts, vep, vob, webm, wlmp, wmv`
