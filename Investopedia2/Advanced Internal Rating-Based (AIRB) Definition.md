Advanced Internal Rating-Based (AIRB) Definition
## What Is Advanced Internal Rating-Based (AIRB)?

An advanced internal rating-based (AIRB) approach to credit risk measurement is a method that requests that all risk components be calculated internally within a [financial institution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp). Advanced internal rating-based (AIRB) can help an institution reduce its [capital requirements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalrequirement.asp) and [credit risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp).

In addition to the basic internal rating-based (IRB) approach estimations, the advanced approach assesses the risk of default using [loss given default (LGD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lossgivendefault.asp), [exposure at default (EAD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exposure_at_default.asp), and the probability of default (PD). These three elements help determine the risk-weighted asset (RWA) that is calculated on a percentage basis for the total required capital."

### Key Takeaways

-   An advanced internal rating-based (AIRB) system is a way of accurately measuring a financial firm's risk factors.
-   In particular, AIRB is an internal estimate of credit risk exposure based on isolating specific risk exposures such as defaults in its loan portfolio.
-   Using AIRB, a bank can streamline its capital requirements by isolating the specific risk factors that are most serious and downplaying others.

## Understanding Advanced Internal Rating-Based Systems

Implementing the AIRB approach is one step in the process of becoming a Basel II-compliant institution. However, an institution may implement the AIRB approach only if they comply with certain supervisory standards outlined in the [Basel II](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baselii.asp) accord.

Basel II is a set of international banking regulations, issued by the [Basel Committee on Bank Supervision](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baselcommittee.asp) in July 2006, which expand upon those outlined in [Basel I](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basel_i.asp). These regulations provided uniform rules and guidelines to level the international banking field. Basel II expanded the rules for minimum capital requirements established under Basel I, provided a framework for regulatory review, and set disclosure requirements for assessment of capital adequacy. Basel II also incorporates [credit risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) of institutional assets.

## Advanced Internal Rating-Based Systems and Empirical Models

The AIRB approach allows banks to estimate many internal risk components themselves. While the empirical models among institutions vary, one example is the Jarrow-Turnbull model. Originally developed and published by Robert A. Jarrow (Kamakura Corporation and Cornell University), along with Stuart Turnbull, (University of Houston), the Jarrow-Turnbull model is a “reduced-form” credit model. Reduced form credit models center on describing bankruptcy as a statistical process, in contrast with a microeconomic model of the firm's capital structure. (The latter process forms the basis of common "structural credit models.") The Jarrow–Turnbull model employs a random interest rates framework. Financial institutions often work with both structural credit models and Jarrow-Turnbull ones, when determining the risk of default.

Advanced Internal Rating-Based systems also help banks determine [loss given default (LGD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lossgivendefault.asp) and [exposure at default (EAD).](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exposure_at_default.asp) Loss given default is the amount of money to be lost in the event of a borrower default; while exposure at default (EAD) is the total value a bank is exposed to at the time of said default.

## Advanced Internal Rating-Based Systems and Capital Requirements

Set by regulatory agencies, such as the [Bank for International Settlements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bis.asp), the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp), and the [Federal Reserve Board](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frb.asp), capital requirements set the amount of [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) is needed to be held for a certain level of assets at many financial institutions. They also ensure that banks and depository institutions have enough capital to both sustain [operating losses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-loss.asp) and honor withdrawals. AIRB can help financial institutions determine these levels.
