Publication 972: Child Tax Credit
## What Is Publication 972: Child Tax Credit?

Publication 972 is a document published by the [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) that provides guidance on determining the exact amount of the [child tax credit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/childtaxcredit.asp) that taxpayers can claim.

The document includes an update on any changes in the tax credit for the year,1 a worksheet to help taxpayers calculate their child credits in certain unusual cases,2 as well as instructions for determining the child tax credit to claim on [Form 1040](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp), and the amount of earned income to enter on Schedule 8812: Additional Child Tax Credit.2

#### Tax Deductions Vs. Tax Credits

### Key Takeaways

-   Publication 972 explains one of America's most popular tax credits, the Child Tax Credit.
-   For 2020, the maximum credit per child is $2,000.
-   There are upper-income limits on eligibility for the credit.

## Understanding Publication 972: Child Tax Credit

Most parents, foster parents, and guardians of children under age 17 can use the child tax credit to lower their [taxable income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp) for the year.2 This benefit can be claimed using Form 1040 or 1040NR.3

### Eligibility

IRS Publication 972, downloadable [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p972.pdf), can be used to determine if a child is eligible. According to the document, a qualifying child or [dependent](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent.asp) must:

-   Be under the age of 17 by the end of the tax year;
-   Be claimed as a dependent on the taxpayer's federal tax return;
-   Be a U.S. citizen, [resident alien](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/residentalien.asp), or nationalâ€”more information on residency requirements can be found in IRS [Publication 519](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs-pub-519.asp);
-   Have lived with the taxpayer for more than half of the tax year; and
-   Not have provided more than half of their own financial support.2

### Credit Amount

Publication 972 also discloses how much credit a taxpayer can receive. In the 2020 [tax year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxyear.asp), the maximum amount that can be requested for a qualifying child is $2,000. That limit has been in effect since 2018, when the IRS doubled the $1,000 credit available on 2017 [tax returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxreturn.asp).4

IRS Publication 972 provides a worksheet that can be used to determine the amount of child tax credit that can be claimed.2

### Refunds

Publication 972 provides guidance on potentially getting a portion of any unused credit refunded, too.2 Following changes to the law in 2017, the refundable portion of the child tax credit, known as the [additional child tax credit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/additional-child-tax-credit.asp) (ACTC), increased to $1,400 from $1,000. This means low-income taxpayers whose credits exceed their [tax liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp) can get refunded up to $1,400.2

The IRS allows families with an annual income of more than $2,500 to request a refund using the ACTC.2 To make a claim for a refund, filers must complete Schedule 8812.5

## Special Considerations

The child tax credit has limits and is not available to taxpayers at certain high-income levels.

In 2020, the tax credit is reduced for single parents with an [adjusted gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp) (AGI) of $200,000. Meanwhile, for [married couples filing jointly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfj.asp), eligibility is reduced at $400,000 and eliminated at $440,000.6
