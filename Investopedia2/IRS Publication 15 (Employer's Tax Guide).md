IRS Publication 15 (Employer's Tax Guide)
## What Is the IRS Publication 15?

IRS Publication 15: Employer's Tax Guide is a document published by the [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) detailing an employer's responsibilities for filing and reporting tax information. The document covers the [withholding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withholdingtax.asp), depositing, reporting, paying, and correcting of taxes for employees (although not for the corporation itself). IRS Publication 15 is also referred to as Circular E.1

### Key Takeaways

-   IRS Publication 15: Employer's Tax Guide is a document published by the Internal Revenue Service detailing an employer's responsibilities for filing and reporting tax information.
-   The document covers the withholding, depositing, reporting, paying, and correcting of taxes for employees (although not for the corporation itself).
-   The Tax Guide details federal income tax amounts for payroll withholdings, including Medicare and Social Security amounts.

## Understanding IRS Publication 15

IRS Publication 15 is used to determine [federal income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal_income_tax.asp), but not state or [local taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/localtax.asp). The Tax Guide details federal income tax amounts for payroll withholdings, including [Medicare](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp) and Social Security amounts.2 Employers should refer to their state's tax rules to ensure that proper state income tax amounts are withheld from employees' paychecks. Extra tax information is also available in IRS Publication 15-A.3

Previously, one of the most important features contained in the Employer’s Tax Guide was the Percentage Method Tables and Wage Bracket Method Tables for Income Tax Withholding.4 However, for the 2020 Employer's Tax Guide, these withholding tables have been removed. These tables—and the employer instructions on how to figure employee withholding—are now included in Publication 15-T, Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods. The IRS also provides an assistant on their website, called the [Income Tax Withholding Assistant for Employers](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/income-tax-withholding-assistant-for-employers), to help employers figure out employee withholding.5

These wage bracket tables help an employer to know exactly which percentage of their employees’ payroll they should be [withholding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withholding.asp) for taxes every pay period in order to comply with federal tax regulations. In order to determine the tax withholding amount, an employee must also file a [W-4 Form](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w4form.asp), which can be updated as situations change in the employee’s life, such as a new family member.6 In the event that an employee does not file a W-4, the Employer’s Tax Guide also details what amount to withhold instead.7
