What You Should Know About Deliverables
## What Are Deliverables?

The term _deliverables_ is a [project management term](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/project-management.asp) that's traditionally used to describe the quantifiable goods or services that must be provided upon the completion of a project. Deliverables can be tangible or intangible in nature. For example, in a project focusing on upgrading a firm's technology, a deliverable may refer to the acquisition of a dozen new computers.

On the other hand, for a software project, a deliverable might allude to the implementation of a computer program aimed at improving a company's [accounts receivable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp) computational efficiency.

## Understanding Deliverables

In addition to computer equipment and software programs, a deliverable may refer to in-person or online training programs, as well as design samples for products in the process of being developed. In many cases, deliverables are accompanied by instruction manuals.

### Documentation

Deliverables are usually contractually obligated requirements, detailed in agreements drawn up between two related parties within a company, or between a client and an outside consultant or developer. The documentation precisely articulates the description of a deliverable, as well as the delivery timeline and payment terms.

**\[Important: Sometimes, distributors that are purchasing independent films for theatrical release will not include a list of deliverables with the first draft of a term sheet; it's thus important for filmmakers to proactively ask for the expected deliverables so that they can be assembled in a timely manner.\]**

### Milestones

Many large projects include [milestones](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/010616/whats-average-401k-balance-age.asp), which are interim goals and targets that must be achieved by stipulated points in time.
