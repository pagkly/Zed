Lis Pendens
## What Is a Lis Pendens?

A lis pendens is an official notice to the public that a lawsuit involving a claim on a property has been filed. Lis pendens is connected to the concept that a buyer of a property must assume any litigation that exists pertaining to the property. If a bank is suing the owner of a lot and a new buyer purchases the lot, then the new owner must face the lawsuit; sale of the property does not prevent the plaintiff from seeking redress via litigation. It can represent a [[contingent liability]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contingentliability.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A lis pendens is an official, public notice that a property has a pending lawsuit or claim attached to it.
-   Lis pendens can only be filed if a claim is related specifically to the property; however, it specifies that the owner of the property must assume any litigation associated with it.
-   Lis pendens are common divorce cases in which spouses are divvying up assets, or in cases in which a home is up for foreclosure after a borrower is delinquent.

## How Lis Pendens Work

Lis pendens is literally translated from Latin as "a suit pending." This condition can adversely affect the sale price or possibility of a sale since any pending litigations are typically unfavorable for the owner. The term is commonly abbreviated "lis pend."

Lis pendens provides constructive notice, or a warning, to prospective homebuyers that the ownership of a property is in dispute and there is litigation pending. Lis pendens can only be filed if a claim is related specifically to the property. By filing a lis pendens, an individual or entity is protecting its claim to the title pending the outcome of the lawsuit. A lis pendens is only lifted once the lawsuit has been settled. Because pending litigation can take months and sometimes years, buyers are often advised to stay clear of these properties.

## When a Lis Pendens Is Used

Lis pendens is often filed in divorce cases where the distribution of [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp) properties has not been settled. It is particularly common in cases where a property is listed in the name of one spouse, and the other spouse seeks a portion of the asset. The spouse whose name is on the title would have a difficult time selling the property under pending litigation.

Lis pendens is almost always used by lenders who have filed a [[notice of default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notice-of-default.asp) on a delinquent borrower. Banks use the procedure to put the public on notice that a property is in [[foreclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp). Other types of creditors whose debt is secured by property can also foreclose on a property. This often occurs when a homeowners' association initiates a foreclosure for delinquent fees.

It is not uncommon for lis pendens to arise in cases of contract disputes, where a buyer feels he has been wrongly excluded from the purchase of a home. For example, if buyer A and a seller enter into a contract for the sale of a home and the seller decides to sell the home to buyer B, buyer A may sue the seller to enforce the sale. The buyer can file a lis pendens, making it difficult for the seller to actually sell the house. If buyer B proceeds with the purchase and the courts determine that buyer A is entitled to enforce the sale, buyer B loses the property to buyer A and must go to the seller to get his money back.
