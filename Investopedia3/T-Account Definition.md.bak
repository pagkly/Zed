T-Account Definition
## What is a T-Account?

A T-account is an informal term for a set of [financial records](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-records.asp) that uses [double-entry bookkeeping](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-entry.asp). The term describes the appearance of the bookkeeping entries. First, a large letter T is drawn on a page. The title of the account is then entered just above the top horizontal line, while underneath [debits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debit.asp) are listed on the left and [credits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp) are recorded on the right, separated by the vertical line of the letter T.

A T-account is also called a ledger account.

## Understanding T-Account

In [double-entry bookkeeping](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-entry.asp), a widespread [accounting method](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountingmethod.asp), all financial transactions are considered to affect at least two of a company's accounts. One account will get a debit entry, while the second will get a credit entry to record each transaction that occurs. 

The credits and debits are recorded in a [general ledger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalledger.asp), where all account balances must match. The visual appearance of the ledger journal of individual accounts resembles a T-shape, hence why a ledger account is also called a T-account.

A T-account is the graphical representation of a [general ledger](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/general-ledger/) that records a business’ transactions**.** It consists of the following:

-   An account title at the top horizontal line of the T
-   A debit side on the left
-   A credit side on the right

### Key Takeaways

-   A T-account is an informal term for a set of financial records that use double-entry bookkeeping.
-   It is called a T-account because the bookkeeping entries are laid out in a way that resembles a T-shape.
-   The account title appears just above the T. Underneath, debits are listed on the left and credits are recorded on the right, separated by a line.
-   The T-account guides accountants on what to enter in a ledger to get an adjusting balance so that revenues equal expenses. 

## Example of T-Account

If Barnes & Noble Inc. sold $20,000 worth of books, it will debit its [cash account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashaccount.asp) $20,000 and credit its books or [inventory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp) account $20,000. This double-entry system shows that the company now has $20,000 more in cash and a corresponding $20,000 less in inventory on its books. The T-account will look like this:

## T- Account Recording

For different accounts, debits and credits may translate to increases or decreases, but the debit side must always lie to the left of the T outline and the credit entries must be recorded on the right side. The major components of the [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp)—[assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp), [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp) and [shareholders’ equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp) (SE)—can be reflected in a T-account after any financial transaction occurs. 

The debit entry of an asset account translates to an increase to the account, while the right side of the asset T-account represents a decrease to the account. This means that a business that receives cash, for example, will debit the asset account, but will credit the account if it pays out cash. 

The liability and shareholders’ equity (SE) in a T-account have entries on the left to reflect a decrease to the accounts and any credit signifies an increase to the accounts. A company that [issues shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issuedshares.asp) worth $100,000 will have its T-account show an increase in its asset account and a corresponding increase in its equity account:

T-accounts can also be used to record changes to the [income statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp), where accounts can be set up for [revenues](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp) ([profits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp)) and [expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp) (losses) of a firm. For the revenue accounts, debit entries decrease the account, while a credit record increases the account. On the other hand, a debit increases an expense account, and a credit decreases it.

## T-Account Advantages

T-accounts are commonly used to prepare [adjusting entries](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjusting-journal-entry.asp). The matching principle in [accrual accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrualaccounting.asp) states that all expenses must match with revenues generated during the period. The T-account guides accountants on what to enter in a ledger to get an adjusting balance so that revenues equal expenses.

A business owner can also use T-accounts to extract information, such as the nature of a transaction that occurred on a particular day or the balance and movements of each account.
