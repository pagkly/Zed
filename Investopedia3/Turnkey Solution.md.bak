Turnkey Solution
## What is a Turnkey Solution?

A turnkey solution is a type of system built [end-to-end](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/end-to-end.asp) for a customer that can be easily implemented into a current business process. It is immediately ready to use upon implementation and is designed to fulfill a certain process such as manufacturing (in part or whole), billing, website design, training, or content management.

A turnkey solution system is different than a custom-built or designed system. When a company or business isn't looking for multiple bells and whistles, a turnkey solution may be an affordable and simple option.

In a turnkey solution, a corporate buyer just has to "turn" a "key" to commence a business activity in the newly built structure. "Solution" evolved in the turnkey concept as economies became more service-based.

### Key Takeaways

-   Turnkey is a word that can be used to describe a solution, a business, or a property.
-   A turnkey solution is the opposite of a custom-built solution. 
-   Turnkey solutions are created to be implemented into a current business process without disruption. 
-   Turnkey solutions can save a company time and money when implemented with success.

A possible drawback of this method, as opposed to designing a process in-house or a custom-built system, is that specifications that are important to a particular company may not be sufficiently integrated into the solution. In-house or custom-built versus turnkey decisions take the complexity of a business process into consideration.

With rapid advances in technology [software](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050416/industry-handbook-software-industry.asp) and hardware, turnkey solutions are popular for businesses that desire speed to market.

## Other Types of Turnkey Terms

Traditionally, turnkey, as a term, is commonly applied to construction projects, such as warehouses, other purpose-built buildings, or houses. The idea is that the building contractor finishes a product that the buyer can utilize immediately.

A turnkey property is usually a newly renovated and updated apartment building or home that is move-in ready for buyers or renters. Real estate companies, property sellers and buyers, and real estate investors often describe new buildings or homes as "turnkey" ready.

A turnkey business may refer to a business that can be purchased without having to make any changes to the business model or products sold. For example, a franchise like Taco Bell is a type of turnkey business.

## Pros and Cons of Turnkey Solutions

A turnkey solution may be the most affordable way to construct something end-to-end that is beneficial to multiple users. However, turnkey solutions may not take into account the individual needs of a company. A turnkey solution for content management software offered by a third-party company may be cheaper to purchase, but it may not cover all the needs of the purchaser.

## Example of a Turnkey Solution

A company looking to implement an online billing feature on its website can use third-party providers to process each [transaction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction.asp) and handle all the technical issues surrounding this process. The use of a turnkey solution, in this case, allows the company to avoid the headaches of programming the tool in-house and the approvals associated with developing a billing system from scratch.
