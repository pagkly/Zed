Vortex Indicator (VI)
## What is the Vortex Indicator (VI)?

A vortex indicator (VI) is an indicator composed of two lines - an uptrend line (VI+) and a downtrend line (VI-). These lines are typically colored green and red respectively. A vortex indicator is used to spot trend [reversals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp) and confirm current trends.

## Understanding Vortex Indicator (VI)

The vortex indicator was first developed by Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman who introduced the concept in a 2009 edition of “Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities.” 1The vortex indicator is based on two trendlines: VI+ and VI-.

## Vortex Indicator Calculations

The calculation for the indicator is divided into four parts.

1\. True range (TR) is the greatest of:

-   Current high minus current low
-   Current high minus previous close
-   Current low minus previous close

2\. [Uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp) and downtrend movement:

-   VM+ = Absolute value of current high minus prior low
-   VM- = Absolute value of current low minus prior high

3\. Parameter length (n)

-   Decide on a parameter length (between 14 and 30 days is common)
-   Sum the last n period’s true range, VM+ and VM-:
-   Sum of the last n periods’ true range = SUM TRn
-   Sum of the last n periods’ VM+ = SUM VMn+
-   Sum of the last n periods’ VM- = SUM VMn−

4\. Create the trendlines VI+ and VI-

-   SUM VMn+/SUM TRn = VIn+
-   SUM VMn-/SUM TRn = VIn−
-   Repeating this process daily forms the VI+ and VI- trendlines.

The traditional application of using VI- and VI+ crossovers can result in a number of false trade signals when price action is choppy. Increase the number of periods used in the indicator to reduce this, for example, using 25 periods instead of 14.

## Inferences

The vortex indicator is commonly used in conjunction with other reversal trend patterns to help support a reversal signal. It is integrated into most [technical analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) software programs. VI+ and VI- are typically graphed independently below a candlestick chart. The chart below provides an example with lines that indicate changing trend signals on a [candlestick](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp) chart.

An uptrend or buy signal occurs when VI+ is below VI- and then crosses above VI- to take the top position among the trendlines. A downtrend or sell signal occurs when VI- is below VI+ and crosses above VI+ to take the top position among the trendlines. Overall, the trendline in the top position generally dictates whether the [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) is in an uptrend or downtrend.
