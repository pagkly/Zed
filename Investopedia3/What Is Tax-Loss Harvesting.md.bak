What Is Tax-Loss Harvesting?
## What Is Tax-Loss Harvesting?

Tax-loss harvesting is the selling of securities at a loss to offset a [capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) liability. This strategy is typically employed to limit the recognition of short-term capital gains. Short-term capital gains are generally taxed at a higher federal income tax rate than long-term capital gains.1 However, the method may also offset long-term capital gains.

## Understanding Tax-Loss Harvesting

Tax-loss harvesting is also known as "tax-loss selling." Usually, this strategy is implemented near the end of the calendar year but may happen at any time in a tax year.

With tax-loss harvesting, an investment that has an unrealized loss is sold allowing a credit against any realized gains that occurred in the portfolio. The asset sold is then replaced with a similar asset to maintain the [portfolio's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) asset allocation and expected risk and return levels.

For many investors, tax-loss harvesting is the most critical tool for reducing taxes. Although tax-loss harvesting cannot restore an investor to their previous position, it can lessen the severity of the loss. For example, a loss in the value of Security A could be sold to offset the increase in the price of Security B, thus eliminating the [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp) [tax liability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp) of Security B.

## Example of Tax-Loss Harvesting

Assume an investor earns income that puts them into the highest capital gains tax category (more than $434,550 if single; $488,850 if married filing jointly). They sold investments and realized [long-term capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-term_capital_gain_loss.asp), which are subject to a tax rate of 20%.1 Below are the investor's portfolio gains and losses and trading activity for the year:

**Portfolio:**

-   Mutual Fund A: $250,000 unrealized gain, held for 450 days
-   Mutual Fund B: $130,000 unrealized loss, held for 635 days
-   Mutual Fund C: $100,000 unrealized loss, held for 125 days

**Trading Activity:**

-   Mutual Fund E: Sold, realized a gain of $200,000. Fund was held for 380 days
-   Mutual Fund F: Sold, realized a gain of $150,000. Fund was held for 150 days

Without tax-loss harvesting, the tax liability from this activity is:

-   Tax without harvesting = ($200,000 x 20%) + ($150,000 x 37%) = $40,000 + $55,500 = $95,500

If the investor harvested losses by selling [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) B and C, they would help to offset the gains, and the tax liability would be:

-   Tax with harvesting = (($200,000 - $130,000) x 20%) + (($150,000 - $100,000) x 37%) = $14,000 + $18,500 = $32,500

The proceeds of the sales may then be reinvested in assets like the ones sold, although [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) rules dictate that investors must wait at least 30 days before purchasing another asset that is “substantially identical” to the asset that was sold at a loss for tax-loss harvesting purposes.2

This can help preserve the value of the investor’s portfolio while defraying the cost of capital gains taxes on the profits of the sales of Mutual Fund E and Mutual Fund F. Using the tax-loss harvesting strategy, investors can realize significant tax savings.
