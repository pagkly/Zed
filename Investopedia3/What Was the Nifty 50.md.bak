## Understanding the Nifty Fifty

The Nifty 50 stocks got their notoriety in the [bull markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) of the 1960s and early 1970s. They became known as "one-decision" stocks because investors were told by individuals such as University of Pennsylvania professor Jeremy Siegel that they could [buy and hold](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyandhold.asp) them forever. That wasn't always the case. Though no one comprehensive list exists of the Nifty 50, examples of some of these stocks included General Electric ([GE](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GE)), Coca-Cola ([KO](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=KO)), and IBM ([IBM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=IBM)). However, part of this list included companies that have been troubled in the last decade, such as Xerox and Polaroid.

## Nifty Fifty Stocks and Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios

Historically nifty-fifty stocks were favored in part due to their high price-to-earnings or P/E ratios. P/E ratios compare a stock’s current market value (price) to its earnings-per-share. Earnings are the company’s net profits, which the CEO and investor relations team announce each quarter on the company’s earnings conference call. The P/E ratio indicates the dollar amount an investor should invest in a company to receive one dollar of that company’s earnings. The P/E is thus sometimes referred to as the price multiple.

Today high P/E ratios, such as with many technology companies (i.e. Tesla’s ([TSLA](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=TSLA)) forward P/E of 1,076) can indicate volatility and a lack of stability. If the company’s price is significantly higher than its actual concrete earnings, this imbalance could suggest investors have over-hyped the company. If the company fails to generate profits, investors who have purchased the stock at a high [valuation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp) could see their holdings decline if the market catches on and price drops accordingly.

## Nifty Fifty and Today’s Blue Chip Stocks

Today’s [blue-chip stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechip.asp) in several ways resemble the Nifty Fifty stocks of prior decades. Blue-chip stocks are nationally recognized, well-established, and financially sound companies such as Coca-Cola, Disney, PepsiCo, Wal-Mart, General Electric, IBM, and McDonald’s. Dominant in their respective industries, many of these names overlap with those in the Nifty Fifty. Blue-chip stocks represent highly reputable brands and have survived multiple downturns in the economy over the years.

Investors with a low-risk profile (i.e. more conservative or potentially older investors, nearing retirement and looking for stability) often place their assets in blue-chip stocks. These are excellent options for capital preservation. Steady dividend payments provide a stream of income if the investor does not have a salary and also protects the portfolio against inflation.
