## Upside Gap Three Methods Trader Psychology

Suppose the market is engaged in a current uptrend. The rally continues on the first candle in a healthy session with the close well above the open, generating a wide range real body. This increases the bull's confidence, while putting bears on the defensive. Their caution is justified because the second candle opens with a gap up and healthy buying pressure that lifts the security to a new high. [Profit-taking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profittaking.asp) causes the third candle to close the gap between the first and second candles. The bulls assume the uptrend will resume now that the gap has filled.

## Downside Gap Three Methods Trader Psychology

Now suppose the market is engaged in a current downtrend. The decline continues on the first candle in a weak session with the close well below the open, generating a wide range real body. This increases the bear's confidence, while putting bulls on the defensive. Their caution is justified because the second candle opens with a down gap and active selling pressure that drops the security to a new low. [Short covering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp) causes the third candle to close the gap between the first and second candles. The bears assume the downtrend will resume now that the gap has filled.

## Practical Example of Trading a Gap Three Methods Pattern

Paul has spotted an Upside Gap Three Methods pattern on the chart of Cellectis S.A. and wants to use the formation to enter a long position in the direction of the trend and set his risk parameters. He could execute a trade at the closing price of the third candle at $16.39 and place a [stop-loss order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) below the first candle’s low at $15.75. David may decide to take a more conservative approach and enter a [buy stop order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buystoporder.asp) slightly above the second candle’s high at $16.95, waiting for confirmation that the uptrend has resumed. He could then use the low of the third candle at $16.27 as a stop-loss point.
