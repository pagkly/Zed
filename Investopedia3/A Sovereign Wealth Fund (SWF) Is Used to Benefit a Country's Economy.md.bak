A Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) Is Used to Benefit a Country's Economy
## What Is a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF)?

A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund comprised of money generated by the government, often derived from a country's surplus reserves. SWFs provide a benefit for a country's economy and its citizens.

The funding for a SWF can come from a variety of sources. Popular sources are surplus reserves from state-owned natural resource revenues, trade surpluses, [bank reserves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-reserve.asp) that may accumulate from budgeting excesses, foreign currency operations, money from privatizations, and governmental transfer payments.

In general, sovereign wealth funds usually have a targeted purpose. Some countries have sovereign wealth funds that can be similar to venture capital for the private sector.

### Key Takeaways

-   A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund.
-   Sovereign wealth funds can be derived from a variety of sources and used for a variety of purposes.
-   Acceptable investments in each SWF vary from fund to fund and country to country.

## Understanding Sovereign Wealth Funds

Similar to any type of investment fund, SWFs have their own objectives, terms, risk tolerances, liability matches, and liquidity concerns. Some funds may prefer returns over liquidity and vice versa. Depending on the assets and objectives, sovereign wealth funds’ risk management can range from very conservative to a high tolerance for risk.

## Types of SWFs

Traditional classifications of [sovereign wealth fund](https://www.swfinstitute.org/sovereign-wealth-fund/)s include:

-   Stabilization funds
-   Savings or future generation funds
-   Public benefit pension reserve funds
-   Reserve investment funds
-   Strategic Development Sovereign Wealth Funds (SDSWF)
-   Funds targeting specific industries (possibly emerging or distressed)
-   Foreign currency reserve assets. (Some classifications may not consider these funds as SWFs.) Foreign currency reserve funds are powerful funds that may be used for specific governmental purposes and/or for helping to manage the trading power of a currency globally.

## Investment Terms

The amount of money in a SWF is usually substantial. The acceptable investments included in each SWF vary from fund to fund and country to country. Countries can create or dissolve SWFs to match the needs of their population. Funds with liquidity concerns may limit investments to only very liquid public [debt instruments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtinstrument.asp). In some cases, sovereign wealth funds will invest directly in domestic industries. Liquidity, debt, and allocation balances can be some of the key factors in investment terms.

There can be a concern that SWFs have a political influence. Some of the most significant sovereign wealth funds are not entirely transparent about their investments and corporate governance practices.
