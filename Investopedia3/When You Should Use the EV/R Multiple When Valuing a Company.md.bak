When You Should Use the EV/R Multiple When Valuing a Company
## What Is the Enterprise Value-to-Revenue Multiple (EV/R)?

The enterprise value-to-revenue multiple (EV/R) is a measure of the value of a stock that compares a company's enterprise value to its revenue. EV/R is one of several fundamental indicators that investors use to determine whether a stock is priced fairly. The EV/R multiple is also often used to determine a company's [valuation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp) in the case of a potential acquisition. It’s also called the [enterprise value-to-sales](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevaluesales.asp) multiple.

### Key Takeaways

-   A measure of the value of a stock that compares a company's enterprise value to its revenue.
-   Often used to determine a company's valuation in the case of a potential acquisition.
-   Can be used for companies that do not generate income or profits.

## Understanding Enterprise Value-to-Revenue Multiple (EV/R)

The enterprise value-to-revenue (EV/R) multiple helps compare a company’s revenues to its enterprise value. The lower the better, in that, a lower EV/R multiple signals a company is undervalued.

Generally used as a valuation [multiple](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiple.asp), the EV/R is often used during acquisitions. An acquirer will use the EV/R multiple to determine an appropriate [fair value](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/fair-value/). The enterprise value is used because it adds debt and takes out cash, which an acquirer would take on and receive, respectively.

## How to Calculate Enterprise-Value-to-Revenue Multiple (EV/R)

The enterprise value-to-revenue (EV/R) is easily calculated by taking the [enterprise value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp) of the company and dividing it by the company's revenue.

EV/R\=Enterprise ValueRevenuewhere:Enterprise Value\=MC+D−CCMC\=Market capitalizationD\=DebtCC\=Cash and cash equivalents\\begin{aligned} &\\text{EV/R} = \\frac{ \\text{Enterprise Value} }{ \\text{Revenue} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{Enterprise Value} = \\text{MC} + \\text{D} - \\text{CC} \\\\ &\\text{MC} = \\text{Market capitalization} \\\\ &\\text{D} = \\text{Debt} \\\\ &\\text{CC} = \\text{Cash and cash equivalents} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

## Example of How to Use Enterprise Value-to-Revenue Multiple (EV/R)

Say a company has $20 million in short-term liabilities on the books and $30 million in long-term liabilities. It has $125 million worth of assets, and 10% of those assets are reported as cash. There are 10 million shares of the company's common stock outstanding, and the current price per share of the stock is $17.50. The company reported $85 million in revenue last year.

Using this scenario, the enterprise value of the company is:

Enterprise Value\=($10,000,000×$17.50)+($20,000,000+$30,000,000)−($125,000,000×0.1)\=$175,000,000+$50,000,000−$12,500,000\=$212,500,000\\begin{aligned} \\text{Enterprise Value} &= (\\$10,000,000 \\times \\$17.50) \\\\ &\\quad + (\\$20,000,000 + \\$30,000,000) \\\\ &\\quad - (\\$125,000,000 \\times 0.1) \\\\ &= \\$175,000,000 + \\$50,000,000 \\\\ &\\quad - \\$12,500,000 \\\\ &= \\$212,500,000 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Next, to find the EV/R, simply take the EV and divide it by the revenue for the year:

EV/R\=$212,500,000$85,000,000\=2.5\\begin{aligned} \\text{EV/R} &= \\frac{ \\$212,500,000 }{ \\$85,000,000 }\\\\ &= 2.5 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Enterprise value can be calculated using a slightly more complicated formula that includes a few more variables. Some analysts prefer this method over the more simplified version. The version of enterprise value with added terms is:

Enterprise Value\=MC+D+PSC+MI−CCwhere:PSC\=Preferred shared capitalMI\=Minority interest \\begin{aligned} &\\text{Enterprise Value} = \\text{MC} + \\text{D} + \\text{PSC} + \\text{MI} - \\text{CC} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{PSC} = \\text{Preferred shared capital} \\\\ &\\text{MI} = \\text{Minority interest }\\\\ \\end{aligned}

As a real-life example, consider the major retail sector, notably Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), Target (NYSE: TGT), and Big Lots (NYSE: BIG). The enterprise values of Wal-Mart, Target, and Big Lots are $433.9 billion, $79.33 billion, and $3.36 billion, respectively, as of Aug. 15, 2020.123

Meanwhile, the three have revenues over the [trailing 12 months](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) of $534.66 billion, $80.1 billion, and $5.47 billion, respectively. Dividing each of their enterprise values by revenues means Wal-Mart’s EV/R is 0.81, Target’s is 0.99, and Big Lots’ is 0.61.123

## The Difference Between Enterprise Value-to-Revenue Multiple (EV/R) and Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)

The enterprise value-to-revenue (EV/R) looks at a companies revenue-generating ability, while the enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)—also known as the [enterprise multiple](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ev-ebitda.asp)—looks at a company’s ability to generate operating cash flows.

EV/EBITDA takes into account operating expenses, while EV/R looks at just the top line. The advantage that EV/R has is that it can be used for companies that are yet to generate income or profits, such as the case with Amazon (AMZN) in its early days.

## Limitations of Using Enterprise Value-to-Revenue Multiple (EV/R)

The enterprise value-to-revenue multiple should be used to compare companies in the same industry, and as a benchmark of the ratio from best in breed in the industry to know whether the ratio represents a good performance or poor one.

Also, unlike market cap, which is readily available on the likes of Yahoo! Finance, the EV/R multiple requires calculating the enterprise value. This requires adding the debt and subtracting out the cash and could involve additional factors if using the expanded version.
