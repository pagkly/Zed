## Understanding the MSCI All Country World Index

A less costly and more efficient way would be to invest in ETFs that replicate the performance of an index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. When it comes to global stocks, the index with the widest selection is the MSCI ACWI.

Given that it is also exposed to U.S. equities, it is little surprise that the MSCI ACWI's top constituents by market capitalization are Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Amazon.com, Inc. As of July 2020, the total market capitalization of all companies represented in the MSCI ACWI was at $47.6 trillion. The countries representing the highest total market cap were the U.S. (58%), Japan (7%), and China (5%). The 44 countries with the smallest capitalization represented 24% of the total index by market cap.2

## Alternatives to the MSCI ACWI for Global Equities

An investor seeking to [diversify](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp) their portfolio geographically could invest a portion of their funds in an ETF that tracks the All Country World Index. This would give them exposure to a wide range of global stocks. But since the index tracks U.S. stocks as well as foreign equities, an investor who has already allocated a significant portion of their portfolio to U.S. stocks could opt for an ETF that tracks foreign equities only.

Deciding on how to allocate a portfolio is best discussed with a qualified [financial advisor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-advisor.asp).
