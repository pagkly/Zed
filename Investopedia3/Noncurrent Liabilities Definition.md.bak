Noncurrent Liabilities Definition
## What Are Noncurrent Liabilities?

Noncurrent liabilities, also called [long-term liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermliabilities.asp) or [long-term debts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermdebt.asp), are long-term financial obligations listed on a company’s balance sheet. These liabilities have obligations that become due beyond twelve months in the future, as opposed to current liabilities which are short-term debts with maturity dates within the following twelve month period.

### Key Takeaways

-   Noncurrent liabilities, also known as long-term liabilities, are obligations listed on the balance sheet not due for more than a year.
-   Various ratios using noncurrent liabilities are used to assess a company’s leverage, such as debt-to-assets and debt-to-capital.
-   Examples of noncurrent liabilities include long-term loans and lease obligations, bonds payable and deferred revenue.

## Understanding Noncurrent Liabilities

Noncurrent liabilities are compared to cash flow, to see if a company will be able to meet its financial obligations in the long-term. While lenders are primarily concerned with short-term [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) and the amount of [current liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp), long-term investors use noncurrent liabilities to gauge whether a company is using excessive leverage. The more stable a company’s cash flows, the more debt it can support without increasing its default risk.

### Important

While current liabilities assess liquidity, noncurrent liabilities help assess solvency.

Investors and creditors use numerous financial ratios to assess liquidity risk and leverage. The debt ratio compares a company's [total debt to total assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totaldebttototalassets.asp), to provide a general idea of how leveraged it is. The lower the percentage, the less leverage a company is using and the stronger its equity position. The higher the ratio, the more financial risk a company is taking on. Other variants are the [long term debt to total assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-term-debt-to-total-assets-ratio.asp) ratio and the long-term debt to capitalization ratio, which divides noncurrent liabilities by the amount of capital available.

Analysts also use coverage ratios to assess a company’s financial health, including the cash flow-to-debt and the [interest coverage ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestcoverageratio.asp). The cash flow-to-debt ratio determines how long it would take a company to repay its debt if it devoted all of its cash flow to debt repayment. The interest coverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing a company's [earnings before interest and taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT) by its debt interest payments for the same period, gauges whether enough income is being generated to cover interest payments. To assess short-term liquidity risk, analysts look at liquidity ratios like the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the acid test ratio.

## Examples of Noncurrent Liabilities

Noncurrent liabilities include debentures, long-term loans, bonds payable, [deferred tax liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxliability.asp), long-term lease obligations, and pension benefit obligations. The portion of a bond liability that will not be paid within the upcoming year is classified as a noncurrent liability. Warranties covering more than a one-year period are also recorded as noncurrent liabilities. Other examples include [deferred compensation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferred-compensation.asp), deferred revenue, and certain health care liabilities.

Mortgages, car payments, or other loans for machinery, equipment, or land are all long-term debts, except for the payments to be made in the subsequent twelve months which are classified as the [current portion of long-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentportionlongtermdebt.asp). Debt that is due within twelve months may also be reported as a noncurrent liability if there is an intent to [refinance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refinance.asp) this debt with a financial arrangement in the process to restructure the obligation to a noncurrent nature.
