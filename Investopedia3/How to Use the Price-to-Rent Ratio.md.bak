How to Use the Price-to-Rent Ratio
## What Is the Price-to-Rent Ratio?

The price-to-rent ratio is the ratio of home prices to annualized rent in a given location. This ratio is used as a benchmark for estimating whether it's cheaper to rent or own property. The price-to-rent ratio is used as an indicator for whether housing markets are fairly valued, or in a bubble.

### Key Takeaways

-   Price-to-rent is used as a benchmark for estimating whether it is cheaper to rent or own property.
-   It compares the economics of buying versus renting but says nothing about the affordability of either.
-   Trulia’s own price-to-rent ratio is called the Rent vs. Buy Index—comparing the total costs of homeownership with the total cost of renting a similar property.

## Formula and Calculation of Price-to-Rent Ratio

The price-to-rent ratio is calculated by dividing the median home price by the median yearly rent and the formula for the price-to-rent ratio is as follows:

### Price-to-Rent Ratio\=Median Home PriceMedian Annual Rent\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Price-to-Rent Ratio} = \\frac{ \\text{Median Home Price} }{ \\text{Median Annual Rent} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}

## What the Price-to-Rent Ratio Can Tell You

The price-to-rent ratio is used as an indicator for whether housing markets are fairly valued, or in a bubble. The dramatic increase in the ratio leading up to the [2008-2009 housing market crash](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/subprime-market-2008.asp) was, with hindsight, a red flag for the housing bubble. Trulia produces a price-to-rent ratio called the Trulia Rent Versus Buy Index, which compares the total costs of [homeownership](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/first-time-homebuyer-guide.asp) with the total cost of renting a similar property.

The total cost of homeownership factors in mortgage principal and interest, property taxes, insurance, closing costs, [homeowners association](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hoa.asp) (HOA), mortgage insurance, and tax advantages, such as the mortgage interest deduction.

Trulia established thresholds for the ratios as follows: a price-to-rent ratio of 1 to 15 indicates it is much better to buy than rent; a price-to-rent ratio of 16 to 20 indicates it is typically better to rent than buy, and a price-to-rent ratio of 21 or more indicates it is much [better to rent than buy.](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/reasons-renting-is-better-than-buying.aspx)1

## Special Considerations

The price-to-rent ratio shows whether buying or renting would be best for a particular property in a given market. The housing affordability index lays out whether an average family can afford the property based on home prices and income levels. This index is most often used as a gauge for qualifying for a mortgage.

While the price-to-rent ratio compares the economics of buying versus renting, it says nothing about the overall affordability of buying or renting in a given market. Cities where both renting and buying are very expensive, such as San Francisco or New York, could have the same price-to-rent ratio as a small Midwestern town where both homes and rents are relatively cheap.

## Example of How to Use the Price-to-Rent Ratio

As of the second quarter of 2020, the median home value was $291,300.2 The median home rent was $1,463 for August 2020.3 The price-to-rent ratio, thus, was 16.6, or $291,300 / ($1,463 \* 12). This is across the U.S., but the price-to-rent ratio can also be calculated based on figures for a specific city.

The total costs of renting factors in actual rent and renter's insurance.

For Trulia’s version of the price-to-rent ratio, it currently sits at around 18, suggesting it's better to rent than buy as of April 2020.4
