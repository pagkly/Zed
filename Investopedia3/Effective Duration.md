Effective Duration
## What Is Effective Duration?

Effective duration is a [duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) calculation for bonds that have embedded options. This measure of duration takes into account the fact that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change and is, therefore, a measure of risk. Effective duration can be estimated using [modified duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modifiedduration.asp) if a bond with embedded options behaves like an option-free bond.

### Key Takeaways

-   Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds that have embedded options.
-   Cash flows are uncertain in bonds with embedded options, making it difficult to know the rate of return.
-   The impact on cash flows as interest rates change is measured by effective duration.
-   Effective duration calculates the expected price decline of a bond when interest rates rise by 1%. 

## Understanding Effective Duration

A bond that has an embedded feature increases the doubtfulness of cash flows, thus making it hard for an investor to determine the [rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) of a bond. The effective duration helps calculate the [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) of interest rates in relation to the yield curve and therefore the expected cash flows from the bond. Effective duration calculates the expected price decline of a bond when interest rates rise by 1%. The value of the effective duration will always be lower than the maturity of the bond.

A bond with embedded options behaves like an option-free bond when exercising the [embedded option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/embeddedoption.asp) would offer the investor no benefit. As such, the security's cash flows cannot be expected to change given a change in yield. For example, if existing interest rates were 10% and a [callable bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callablebond.asp) was paying a coupon of 6%, the callable bond would behave like an option-free bond because it would not be optimal for the company to call the bond and re-issue it at a higher interest rate.

The longer the maturity of a bond, the larger its effective duration.

## Effective Duration Calculation

The formula for effective duration contains four variables. They are:

P(0) = the bond's original price per $100 worth of par value.

P(1) = the price of the bond if the yield were to decrease by Y percent.

P(2) = the price of the bond if the yield were to increase by Y percent.

Y = the estimated change in yield used to calculate P(1) and P(2).

The complete formula for effective duration is: 

Effective duration = (P(1) - P(2)) / (2 x P(0) x Y)

## Example of Effective Duration

As an example, assume that an investor purchases a bond for 100% par and that the bond is currently yielding 6%. Using a 10 basis-point change in yield (0.1%), it is calculated that with a yield decrease of that amount, the bond is priced at $101. It is also found that by increasing the yield by 10 [basis points](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp), the bond's price is expected to be $99.25. Given this information, the effective duration would be calculated as:

Effective duration = ($101 - $99.25) / (2 x $100 x 0.001) = $1.75 / $0.20 = 8.75

The effective duration of 8.75 means that if there were to be a change in yield of 100 basis points, or 1%, then the bond's price would be expected to change by 8.75%. This is an approximation. The estimate can be made more accurate by factoring in the bond's effective [convexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp).
