Definition Historical Volatility (HV)
## What Is Historical Volatility (HV)?

Historical volatility (HV) is a statistical measure of the [dispersion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dispersion.asp) of returns for a given security or [market index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp) over a given period of time. Generally, this measure is calculated by determining the average deviation from the [average price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averageprice.asp) of a financial instrument in the given time period. Using [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) is the most common, but not the only, way to calculate historical volatility. The higher the historical volatility value, the riskier the security. However, that is not necessarily a bad result as risk works both ways—bullish and bearish.

## Understanding Historical Volatility (HV)

Historical volatility does not specifically measure the likelihood of loss, although it can be used to do so. What it does measure is how far a security's price moves away from its [mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mean.asp) value.

For trending markets, historical volatility measures how far traded prices move away from a central average, or [moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp), price. This is how a strongly trending but smooth market can have low [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) even though prices change dramatically over time. Its value does not fluctuate dramatically from day to day but changes in value at a steady pace over time.

This measure is frequently compared with [implied volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing-strategy/071616/implied-vs-historical-volatility-main-differences.asp) to determine if options prices are over- or [undervalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp). Historical volatility is also used in all types of risk valuations. Stocks with a high historical volatility usually require a higher risk tolerance. And high volatility markets also require wider [stop-loss](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) levels and possibly higher [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) requirements.

Aside from options pricing, HV is often used as an input in other technical studies such as [Bollinger Bands](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp). These bands narrow and expand around a central average in response to changes in volatility, as measured by standard deviations.

## Using Historical Volatility

Volatility has a bad connotation, but many traders and investors can make higher profits when volatility is higher. After all, if a stock or other security does not move it has low volatility, but it also has a low potential to make [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp). And on the other side of that argument, a stock or other security with a very high volatility level can have tremendous profit potential but at a huge cost. It's loss potential would also be tremendous. Timing of any trades must be perfect, and even a correct market call could end up losing money if the security's wide price swings trigger a stop-loss or [margin call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp).

Therefore, volatility levels should be somewhere in the middle, and that middle varies from [market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp) to market and even from stock to stock. Comparisons among peer securities can help determine what level of volatility is "normal."
