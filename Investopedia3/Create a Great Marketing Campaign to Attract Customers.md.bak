## Types of Marketing Campaign Activities

There are many ways to market products and services to customers, from mailing brochures to coordinating a social media blitz. Small companies can email invitations to a special sale and offer a free product to every customer who brings the invitation. Larger companies can use paid advertising and professional agencies to reach a wider audience.

Whatever the size of the company, it's important that someone is dedicated to handling the influx of traffic a marketing campaign generates. If you are prompting customers to sign up for your email list, you must make sure that the list is managed well and that new customers receive welcoming messages. If visits to your website increase, you must continually update your content to convert this traffic to profitable sales.

Companies that lose sales due to major negative press often use marketing campaigns to rehabilitate their image. One example is Chipotle Mexican Grill, which was investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after dozens of customers became sick in 2015 from food safety issues related to E. coli and norovirus.1 Chipotle's sales dropped 30% in the first quarter of 2016, and to regain customer interest, the company offered coupons for free food via [direct mail](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/direct-mail.asp) and texts.2 Chipotle also used online video to announce a $10 million [grant](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grant.asp) to support local farmers.3

## Examples of Successful Marketing Campaigns

The long-running Aflac duck campaign is one example of a campaign that significantly raised [brand recognition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp).

Lay's launched its first "Do Us a Flavor" campaign in 2012, asking customers to suggest new potato-chip flavors through texts and social media. The company's sales increased 12%, and its volume of social media followers tripled.5
