## History of the Vienna Stock Exchange

Founded in 1771 by the empress Maria Theresa, the Vienna Stock Exchange is one of the oldest in the world. In its first years, it was a marketplace for trading [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), [bills of exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/billofexchange.asp), and foreign currencies. The first time that shares were traded was in 1818, and the first corporation to be listed on the exchange was the Austrian National Bank.

World War I saw the close of the Vienna Stock Exchange until the end of 1919. After the war, the exchange experienced a strong revival, which subsequently ended suddenly in March 1934. The global economic crisis and bank collapse affected exchange trading during these years; however, it should be noted the [Stock Market Crash of 1929](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash-1929.asp) in the United States did not have much impact.

In 1938, the incorporation of Austria into the Deutsche Reich caused Wiener Börse to lose its independence. Limited stock market trading continued from then until right before the end of World War II.

After the war, the exchange opened back up in 1948. The stock market was not as robust, but the bond market recovered in 1952. Bond market trading grew until a turnaround in 1985 when an American analyst drew attention to the potential of the Austrian capital market, which triggered a stock boom.
