James H. Clark is a serial and successful [entrepreneur](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp) and computer scientist, perhaps best known for co-founding Netscape with Marc Andreessen in 1994.1 Netscape Navigator was the market leader in web browsers in the early days of the internet, becoming the dominant browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s. However, because it was not free to use, it ultimately lost market share to Microsoft's free competitor, Internet Explorer. Netscape was eventually purchased by America Online (AOL) in 1998, making Clark a [billionaire](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/billionaire.asp).2 Clark started Netscape with a $4.1 million investment and exited the company with a $1.2 billion payout.3

## Understanding James H. Clark

The demise of Netscape Navigator was actually central to [Microsoft's antitrust trial](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/microsoft-antitrust.asp), the result of which was a ruling that stated that Microsoft's bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic, and therefore illegal, business practice. Regardless, by the time this ruling was made, it was too late for Netscape because Internet Explorer had already become the dominant web browser.

Clark's other ventures include founding Silicon Graphics, a company that produced high-quality visual effects for film and 3-D images for engineers. Silicon Graphics counted George Lucas' LucasFilm and Steven Spielberg among its customers, and, by 1991, Silicon Graphics had become a global leader in the production of Hollywood movie visual effects and 3-D imaging.

Clark also founded Healtheon, which merged with WebMD, in addition to being the original investor and chairman of the digital photo sharing and storage website Shutterfly, which was founded in 1999.4 Clark was also an early investor in many famous tech companies that have paid off handsomely.
