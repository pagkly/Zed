Key Ratio Definition
## What Is a Key Ratio?

A key ratio is an important [financial ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-ratios-4689817), one that is widely used and considered one of the fundamental ways to measure a company’s liquidity, efficiency, or [profitability](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033015/what-difference-between-efficiency-ratios-and-profitability-ratios.asp) in relation to its peers.

These financial ratios illustrate and summarize the current financial condition of a company. Those that are in sound [financial health](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-health.asp) will have superior ratios to those that are performing poorly. 

### Key Takeaways

-   Key ratios are the primary financial ratios used to illustrate and summarize the current financial condition of a company.
-   These are produced by comparing different line items from the subject firm's financial statements.
-   Analysts and investors use key ratios to see how companies stack up against their peers.
-   There are plenty of financial ratios at our disposal and determining which are key varies according to opinion and the type of company being analyzed.

## How a Key Ratio Works

Key ratios take data from the subject company's [financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp), such as the balance sheet, income statement, and [statement of cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp), and then compare them with other items. These numbers are then calculated together to produce a ratio that represents key aspects of the company's financial picture, such as liquidity, profitability, use of debt, and earnings strength.

There are plenty of financial ratios at one's disposal and determining which are key varies according to opinion and popularity. Some of the most prevalent ratios include:

-   **[Working capital ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/010915/what-proper-ratio-between-working-capital-current-assets-and-current-liabilities.asp):** Current assets are divided by current liabilities to establish how capable a company is of meeting its current financial [obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp).
-   **[Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp):** Divide the current stock price by [earnings per share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS) to determine the price investors pay for $1 of a company’s profit.
-   **[Return on assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp) (ROA)**: Divide [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) (NI) by total assets to discover the percentage of profit a company earns in relation to the resources it has at its disposal.
-   **[Return on equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) (ROE)**: Divide net income by [shareholders' equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp) to see what yield is returned to a firm's owners and/or investors.

Of course, other investors and analysts will consider other ratios to be the key ones.

Also keep in mind that not all companies operate in the same way, so commonly used ratios tend to vary by industry. In other words, the ratios applied to best compare technology companies won't be the same as those used to effectively compare banks.

In the case of the latter, it's typical to utilize the capital to assets ratio, the loan [loss reserves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loss-reserve.asp) to total loans ratio, and the liquidity ratio. For tech stocks, on the other hand, analysts and investors usually prefer to examine price-to-sales (P/S) ratios, [return on research capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return-on-research-capital.asp) (RORC), and so forth.

## Example of a Key Ratio

Sam is an [analyst](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst.asp) with XYZ Research and wants to learn more about ABC Corp. Sam goes to ABC Corp's investor relations website and downloads its most recent financial statements.

Sam wants to find out how efficient ABC Corp is at managing its [expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessexpenses.asp) to generate profits. Looking at net income, sales, operating costs, accounts payable, and net assets figures, Sam computes some of ABC Corp's key profitability ratios, such as ROA and [profit margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of a Key Ratio

Key ratios represent a crucial step in determining the financial health of a company, as well as whether it is being fairly priced by investors. When utilized correctly, they can help us to pinpoint each company’s strengths and weaknesses and discover how it stacks up against its peers.

That said, investors must be careful when using key ratios. Applying just one or two is usually not sufficient enough to get the full picture. Moreover, it’s also worth bearing in mind that companies may adhere to different [accounting practices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-practice.asp), making them harder to compare. A combination of ratios should be used in conjunction with one another after determining which are the most appropriate for a given case.

### Important

A company can seldom be properly evaluated or analyzed using just one ratio in isolation.
