How Investments Grow by DRIPS (Dividend Reinvestment Plans)
## What Is a Dividend Reinvestment Plan—DRIP?

A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is a program that allows investors to reinvest their [cash dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashdividend.asp) into additional shares or [fractional shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalshare.asp) of the underlying stock on the dividend payment date. Although the term can apply to any automatic reinvestment arrangement set up through a brokerage or investment company, it generally refers to a formal program offered by a publicly traded corporation to existing [shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp). Around 650 companies and 500 closed-end funds currently do so.

## Understanding a Dividend Reinvestment Plan—DRIP

Normally, when dividends are paid, they are received by shareholders as a check or a [direct deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directdeposit.asp) into their bank account. DRIPs, which are also known as dividend reinvestment programs, gives shareholders the option of reinvesting the amount of a declared dividend into additional shares, which are bought directly from the company. Because shares purchased through a DRIP typically come from the company’s own reserve, they are not marketable through stock [exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp). Shares must be redeemed directly through the company, also.

Most DRIPs allow investors to buy shares commission-free or for a nominal fee, and at a significant discount to the current [share price](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/how-companys-share-price-determined.asp); they may set dollar minimums. However, most do not allow [reinvestments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinvestment.asp) much lower than $10. While DRIPs are usually intended for existing shareholders, some companies do make them available to new investors, usually specifying a minimum purchase amount.

Although the shareholder does not actually receive the reinvested dividends, they still need to be reported as [taxable income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp) (unless they are held in a tax-advantaged account, like an IRA).1

## Additional Considerations for DRIPs

There are several advantages of purchasing shares through a DRIP, for both the company issuing the shares and the shareholder.

### Advantages for the Investor

DRIPs offer shareholders a way to accumulate more shares without having to pay a commission. Many companies offer shares at a discount through their DRIP from 1% to 10% off the current share price. Between no commissions and a price discount, the [cost basis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp) for owning the shares can be significantly lower than if the shares were purchased on the [open market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp). Through DRIPs, investors can also buy fractional shares, so every dividend dollar is really going to work.

Long term, the biggest advantage is the effect of automatic reinvestment on the [compounding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp) of returns. When dividends are increased, shareholders receive an increasing amount on each share they own, which can also purchase a larger number of shares. Over time, this increases the [total return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp) potential of the investment. Because more shares can be purchased whenever the stock price decreases, the long-term potential for bigger gains is increased.

### Advantages for the Company

Dividend-paying companies also benefit from DRIPs in a couple of ways. First, when shares are purchased from the company for a DRIP, it creates more capital for the company to use. Second, shareholders who participate in a DRIP are less likely to sell their shares when the [stock market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp) declines. Partly that's because participants tend to be long-term investors and recognize the role their dividends play in the [long-term growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermgrowth.asp) of their portfolio. Of course, another factor is that DRIP-purchased shares are not as liquid as shares purchased on the open market—they can only be redeemed via the company.

## Real-World Example of a DRIP

The 3M company offers a DRIP program. Administered by the company's transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, it gives registered shareholders the option of using all or a portion of their dividends (designated either by dollar percentage or by number of shares) to buy shares; if they don't choose an option when they enroll in the plan, all their dividends will be reinvested. The company pays all fees and commissions.
