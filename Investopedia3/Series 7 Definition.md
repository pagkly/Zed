Series 7 Definition
The Series 7 exam licenses the holder to sell all types of securities products except commodities and futures. Known formally as the General Securities Representative Qualification Examination, the Series 7 exam and its licensing is administered by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp).1

Stockbrokers in the United States need to pass the Series 7 exam to obtain a license to trade. The [[Series 7 exam]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/022216/cfa-vs-series-7-which-easier.asp) focuses on investment risk, taxation, equity, and debt instruments; packaged securities, options, retirement plans, and interactions with clients for prospective securities industry professionals.2 This introductory-level exam assesses a candidate’s knowledge of basic securities industry information including concepts fundamental to working in the industry.1

The purpose of the Series 7 license is to set a level of competency for a registered representative or stockbroker to work in the securities industry. The Series 7 license is an essential requirement for an entry-level [[broker]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp). The licensing exam covers an extensive range of financial terms and topics as well as securities regulations.1

If you need more information on the SIE, FINRA's SIE exam content outline provides more details.6

The firm must file a Form U4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer) for the candidate to be registered for the licensing exam.7 FINRA governs the activities of securities firms and registered brokers, ensuring that anyone who sells securities products is qualified and tested.1
