What Is the Macaulay Duration?
## What Is the Macaulay Duration

The Macaulay duration is the [weighted average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weightedaverage.asp) [term to maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termtomaturity.asp) of the cash flows from a [bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). The weight of each cash flow is determined by dividing the present value of the cash flow by the price. Macaulay duration is frequently used by [portfolio managers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanager.asp) who use an immunization strategy.

Macaulay duration can be calculated:

Macaulay Duration\=∑t\=1n(t×C(1+y)t+n×M(1+y)n)Current Bond Pricewhere:t\=respective time periodC\=periodic coupon paymenty\=periodic yieldn\=total number of periodsM\=maturity valueCurrent Bond Price\=present value of cash flows\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Macaulay Duration} = \\frac{ \\sum\_{t = 1} ^ {n} \\left ( \\frac{ t \\times C }{ (1 + y) ^ t } + \\frac{ n \\times M }{ (1 + y) ^ n } \\right ) }{ \\text{Current Bond Price} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &t = \\text{respective time period} \\\\ &C = \\text{periodic coupon payment} \\\\ &y = \\text{periodic yield} \\\\ &n = \\text{total number of periods} \\\\ &M = \\text{maturity value} \\\\ &\\text{Current Bond Price} = \\text{present value of cash flows} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

## Understanding the Macaulay Duration

The metric is named after its creator, Frederick Macaulay. The Macaulay duration can be viewed as the economic balance point of a group of cash flows. Another way to interpret the statistic is that it is the [weighted](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weighted.asp) average number of years an [investor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) must maintain a position in the bond until the present value of the bond's cash flows equals the amount paid for the bond.

## Factors Affecting Duration

A bond's price, maturity, coupon and [yield to maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldtomaturity.asp) all factor into the calculation of duration. All else equal, as maturity increases, duration increases. As a bond's coupon increases, its duration decreases. As interest rates increase, duration decreases and the bond's sensitivity to further interest rate increases go down. Also, a [sinking fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sinkingfund.asp) in place, a scheduled prepayment before maturity and [call provisions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callprovision.asp) lower a bond's duration.

## Example Calculation

The calculation of Macaulay duration is straightforward. Assume a $1,000 face value bond that pays a 6% coupon and matures in three years. Interest rates are 6% per annum with semiannual compounding. The bond pays the coupon twice a year, and pays the principal on the final payment. Given this, the following cash flows are expected over the next three years:

Period 1:$30Period 2:$30Period 3:$30Period 4:$30Period 5:$30Period 6:$1,030\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Period 1}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 2}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 3}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 4}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 5}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 6}: \\$1,030 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

With the periods and the cash flows known, a discount factor must be calculated for each period. This is calculated as 1 / (1 + r)n, where r is the interest rate and n is the period number in question. The interest rate, r, compounded semiannually is 6%/2 = 3%. Thus the discount factors would be:

Period 1 Discount Factor:1÷(1+.03)1\=0.9709Period 2 Discount Factor:1÷(1+.03)2\=0.9426Period 3 Discount Factor:1÷(1+.03)3\=0.9151Period 4 Discount Factor:1÷(1+.03)4\=0.8885Period 5 Discount Factor:1÷(1+.03)5\=0.8626Period 6 Discount Factor:1÷(1+.03)6\=0.8375\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Period 1 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 1 = 0.9709 \\\\ &\\text{Period 2 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 2 = 0.9426 \\\\ &\\text{Period 3 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 3 = 0.9151 \\\\ &\\text{Period 4 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 4 = 0.8885 \\\\ &\\text{Period 5 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 5 = 0.8626 \\\\ &\\text{Period 6 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 6 = 0.8375 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Next, multiply the period's cash flow by the period number and by its corresponding discount factor to find the present value of the cash flow:

Period 1:1×$30×0.9709\=$29.13Period 2:2×$30×0.9426\=$56.56Period 3:3×$30×0.9151\=$82.36Period 4:4×$30×0.8885\=$106.62Period 5:5×$30×0.8626\=$129.39Period 6:6×$1,030×0.8375\=$5,175.65∑ Period \=16\=$5,579.71\=numerator\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Period 1}: 1 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.9709 = \\$29.13 \\\\ &\\text{Period 2}: 2 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.9426 = \\$56.56 \\\\ &\\text{Period 3}: 3 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.9151 = \\$82.36 \\\\ &\\text{Period 4}: 4 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.8885 = \\$106.62 \\\\ &\\text{Period 5}: 5 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.8626 = \\$129.39 \\\\ &\\text{Period 6}: 6 \\times \\$1,030 \\times 0.8375 = \\$5,175.65 \\\\ &\\sum\_{\\text{ Period } = 1} ^ {6} = \\$5,579.71 = \\text{numerator} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Current Bond Price\=∑ PV Cash Flows \=16Current Bond Price\=30÷(1+.03)1+30÷(1+.03)2Current Bond Price\=+⋯+1030÷(1+.03)6Current Bond Price\=$1,000Current Bond Price\=denominator\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Current Bond Price} = \\sum\_{\\text{ PV Cash Flows } = 1} ^ {6} \\\\ &\\phantom{ \\text{Current Bond Price} } = 30 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 1 + 30 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 2 \\\\ &\\phantom{ \\text{Current Bond Price} = } + \\cdots + 1030 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 6 \\\\ &\\phantom{ \\text{Current Bond Price} } = \\$1,000 \\\\ &\\phantom{ \\text{Current Bond Price} } = \\text{denominator} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

(Note that since the coupon rate and interest rate are the same, the bond will trade at par)

Macaulay Duration\=$5,579.71÷$1,000\=5.58\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Macaulay Duration} = \\$5,579.71 \\div \\$1,000 = 5.58 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

A coupon paying bond will always have its duration less than its time to maturity. In the example above, the duration of 5.58 half-years is less than the time to maturity of six half-years. In other words, 5.58/2 = 2.79 years is less than three years.
