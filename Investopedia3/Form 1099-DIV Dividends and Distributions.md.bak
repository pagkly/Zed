## How to File Form 1099-DIV: Dividends and Distributions

Taxpayers are required to file the information on each Form 1099-DIV they receive on their annual tax form. This can be done on a [Schedule B](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081414/who-needs-fill-out-irs-form-schedule-b.asp) form or directly on [Form 1040](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp). Taxpayers who receive more than $1,500 in taxable interest and/or ordinary dividends during the year are required to fill out Schedule B, which accompanies a 1040 form.2

Dividends are taxed at an investor’s income tax rate with a few exceptions. Qualified dividends are the primary exception. [Qualified dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp) have met certain criteria that allow them to be taxed at a lower capital gains tax rate.3

The tax rate on capital gains may also vary from the ordinary income tax rate. [Short-term capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short-term-gain.asp) are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, but taxes on [long-term capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-term_capital_gain_loss.asp) are lower.4
