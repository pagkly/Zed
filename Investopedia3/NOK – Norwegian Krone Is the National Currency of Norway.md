NOK – Norwegian Krone Is the National Currency of Norway
## What Is NOK – Norwegian Krone

The Norwegian _krone_ (NOK) is the official currency of Norway with its regulation and circulation controlled by the country's central bank, the Norges Bank. The bank issued a total of eight series of [[banknotes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/banknote.asp), including the October 2018, issued of a new 50-_krone_ and 500-_krone_ bills. Consumers may still use the 50-_krone_ and 500-_krone_ banknotes from the previous series until 18 October 2019.

The Norwegian _krone_, or _kroner_ for the plural term, subdivides into 100 _øre_. The word _krone_ translates into English as the crown. Coins come in [[denominations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/denomination.asp) of 1, 5, 10, and 20 _krone_ and banknotes appear as in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 _kroner_. The currency code for NOK is “ISK,” and the currency symbol is “kr.”

### 1963

The year 5 kroner coins were introduced.

Banknotes feature prominent Norwegians such as noted scientists and artists on the front of the currency, along with information indicating the specific person’s contribution to Norwegian culture. The back of each bill depicts some aspect of Norwegian art. For example, the 50-_krone_ note contains a green tint, a portrait of Peter Christen Asbjørnsen on the front and an artist’s rendering of Asbjørnsen’s story _A Summer Night in Krogskogen_.

Production of 1 and 2 øre coins ceased in 1972, and silver was replaced by cupro-nickel in 1920.

## History of the Krone

The first circulation of the _krone_ came in 1875 when it became the replacement of the _speciedaler._ At this time, the conversion rate was four _kroner_ for one _speciedaler_. Following the switch, Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union, an alliance which existed until the outbreak of World War I. During the existence of the Union, the Norwegian _krone_ acted as the gold standard with one kilogram of gold equivalent to 2,480 _kroner_. Use of the NOK as a gold standard ended in 1931.

In 1939 the country's currency pegged to the [[U.S. dollar]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usd.asp) (USD), but while occupied by Germany during the Second World War, it pegged to the Reichsmark. At the war's end, the currency pegged to the [[British pound]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gbp.asp) (GBP). In 1992, the central bank moved away from a fixed exchange rate, allowing the currency to [[float]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatingexchangerate.asp) based on the [[foreign currency exchange rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/i/international-currency-exchange-rates.asp).

The 10 Syrian pound so closely resembles the 20 Norwegian kroner that it can fool many coin-operated, automated service machines in the country.

## Economic Impact on the NOK's Value

As with all currencies, economic trends trigger fluctuation in the value of the Norwegian _krone_. [[Currency investors may seek out the NOK]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/031615/safest-currencies-world.asp) when the [[euro’s]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp) (EUR) value is in doubt. Increased activity in trading the NOK may increase the rate of exchange. Changes in the global price of crude oil also affect the NOK's value as Norway is Western Europe’s leading oil exporter.

Norway's shipping, hydroelectric power, fishing and manufacturing all contribute to the country's [[gross domestic product]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) (GDP). However, it is interesting to note many industries are [[state-owned]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soe.asp). Historically, the _krone_ is a prudent investment as, Norway stakes claim to one of Europe’s most stable economies.
