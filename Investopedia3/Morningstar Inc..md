## History of Morningstar

In 1984, Joe Mansueto left his job as a stock analyst when he realized investors lacked the necessary information to make intelligent investment decisions. At the same time, the mutual fund industry started to accelerate as retirement plans shifted from defined benefit like company pensions to defined contribution. These changing dynamics informed the foundation of Morningstar. Over the next 30 years, Morningstar continued to add products and services that help investors of various expertise. Today, Joe Mansueto is no longer the CEO of Morningstar but still holds the position of executive chairman.
