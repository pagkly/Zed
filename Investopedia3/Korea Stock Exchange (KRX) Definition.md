Korea Stock Exchange (KRX) Definition
## What Is the Korea Stock Exchange (KRX)?

The Korea Stock Exchange is a division of the much larger Korea Exchange (KRX, or the Exchange). Previously, Korea's stock market was a standalone entity. In 2005, the Korea Stock Exchange merged with the Korea Futures Exchange and the electronic market, KOSDAQ, to form the Korea Exchange.

The exchange is the only securities exchange operator in South Korea, making markets in equities, bonds, [stock index futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfutures.asp), stock index options, and [equity options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp). KRX's headquarters are in Busan, and it has an office for cash markets and oversight in Seoul.

## The Korea Stock Exchange: Background

Since its inception in 1956, the Korea Stock Exchange had operated independently. Prior to its 2005 merger to form KRX, the Korea Stock Exchange created the Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (KOSDAQ)—a trading platform similar to its American counterpart, [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp), of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD).

In addition to launching electronic trading, some of the exchange's milestones include establishing a stock index futures and options market from 1996 to 1997, trading [warrants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrant.asp) in 2000, and equity options and [exchange traded funds (ETFs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) in 2002.

Today, investors can trade various instruments on the exchange including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and [real estate investment trusts (REITs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp). KOSDAQ lists more than 1000 high-profile companies including Korea New Network, Imagine Asia, Macrogen, Daewon Media, FNC Entertainment, Genie Music, and SK Broadband.

## How Does the Korea Stock Exchange Work?

In 2019, [the KRX listed 2194 companies](http://global.krx.co.kr/main/main.jsp) with a combined [market capitalization (market cap)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1.9 trillion. Normal trading sessions look the same as those of other major stock markets around the world. Trading opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 3:30 p.m. The market is open every day of the week except Saturday, Sunday and holidays (of which there are 13 in 2020). As with the [S&P 500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) in the United States, an index, the [Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kospi.asp) tracks the health of the exchange.

## The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI)

The KOPSI contains all of the common stocks that are traded on the exchange. The KOSPI was introduced in 1983 with a base value of $100 and today the index trades at around $2,500. As with other major indexes, KOPSI is calculated based on market cap and boasts daily trading volume in excess of multiple hundreds of million shares.

Several offshoots of the index track specific sectors, [factor strategies,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factor-investing.asp) and market caps. The KOSPI 200 Index, for example, consists of 200 large companies in the stock market division. As of 2020, among the biggest holdings in the KOPSI include tech giant [Samsung Electronics](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082714/how-invest-samsung.asp), automotive maker Hyundai Motor, and LG Chemical.

-   **Rapidly growing**: South Korea's economy is expected to continue growing at a rate of 3.9% to 4.2% percent per year through 2030, along with most [Next Eleven (N-11)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/next-eleven.asp) countries.
