Folio Number
## What is a Folio Number?

In [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp), a folio number is a unique number identifying your account with the fund. Like a bank account number, the folio number can be used as a way to uniquely identify fund investors. A folio number also records items such as how much money each investor has placed with the fund, their transaction history, and contact details.

A folio number can also be used to identify journal entries or parcels of land. Different fund houses and providers of similar folio numbers will all use a slightly different method to create a number value.
