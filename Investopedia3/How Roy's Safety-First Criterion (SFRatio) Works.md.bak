How Roy's Safety-First Criterion (SFRatio) Works
## What Is Roy's Safety-First Criterion – SFRatio?

Roy's safety-first criterion, also known as the SFRatio, is an approach to investment decisions that sets a minimum required return for a given level of [risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp). Roy's safety-first criterion allows investors to compare potential portfolio investments based on the probability that the portfolio returns will fall below their minimum desired return threshold.

## The Formula for the SFRatio Is

SFRatio\=re−rmσpwhere:re\=Expected return on portfoliorm\=Investor’s minimum required returnσp\=Standard deviation of the portfolio\\begin{aligned} &SFRatio = \\frac{r\_e-r\_m}{\\sigma\_p}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &r\_e = \\text{Expected return on portfolio}\\\\ &r\_m = \\text{Investor's minimum required return}\\\\ &\\sigma\_p = \\text{Standard deviation of the portfolio}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

## How to Calculate Roy's Safety-First Criterion – SFRatio

The SFRatio is calculated by subtracting the minimum desired return from the [expected return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) of a portfolio and dividing the result by the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) of [portfolio returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio-return.asp). The optimal portfolio will be the one that minimizes the probability that the portfolio's return will fall below a threshold level.

## What Does Roy's Safety-First Criterion Tell You?

The SFRatio provides a probability of getting a [minimum-required return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp) on a portfolio. An investor's optimal decision is to choose the portfolio with the highest SFRatio. Investors can use the formula to calculate and evaluate various scenarios involving different asset-class weights, different investments and other factors that affect the probability of meeting their minimum return threshold.

Some investors feel that Roy's safety-first criterion is a [risk-management](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032415/how-investment-risk-quantified.asp) philosophy in addition to being an evaluation method. By choosing investments that adhere to a minimum acceptable portfolio return, an investor can sleep at night knowing that her investment will achieve a minimum return, and anything above that is "gravy."

The SFRatio is very similar to the [Sharpe ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp); for normally distributed returns, the minimum return is equal to the risk-free rate.

-   Roy's safety-first rule measures the minimum return threshold an investor has for a portfolio.
-   Also known as the SFRatio, investors can use the formula to compare different investing scenarios to choose the one most likely to hit their required minimum return.

## Example of Roy's Safety-First Criterion

Assume three portfolios with various expected returns and standard deviations. Portfolio A has an expected return of 12% with a standard deviation of 20%. Portfolio B has an expected return of 10% with a standard deviation of 10%. Portfolio C has an expected return of 8% with a standard deviation of 5%. The threshold return for the investor is 5%.

Which portfolio should the investor choose? SFRatio for A: (12 - 5) / 20 = 0.35; B: (10 - 5) / 10 = 0.50; C: (8 - 5) / 5 = 0.60. Portfolio C has the highest SFRatio and thus should be selected.
