## What Is Zacks Investment Research?

Founded in 1978 by Len Zacks, armed with his PhD from MIT, hit upon a key discovery: _Earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices._

The company provides professional investors with financial data and analysis helpful in making better investment decisions for proprietary accounts and the investment accounts of clients. Zacks is probably known best known for their extensive array of consensus earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates.
