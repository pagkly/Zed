## Understanding the Group of 30 (G-30)

The G-30 claims its mission is to deepen understanding of international economic and financial issues, and to explore the international repercussions of decisions taken in the public and private sectors." It sets out to achieve this by meeting twice yearly in Washington, D.C. Topics that often come up include [foreign exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp), [capital markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp), central banks, and [macroeconomic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp) issues, such as global production and [labor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-market.asp).

The events hosted by the G-30 are invitation-only, meaning that regular members of the public are not able to attend them. However, the group has made it possible to download its publications and research for free from its website.

Aside from meeting twice a year, the G-30 also organizes study groups and seminars based on topics of mutual interest to its membership. Areas of recent focus are said to include financial reform, lessons from the [financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp), the [credit market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_market.asp), and stability and growth.

Often, the G-30 reports generate little interest from the public, due to their technical nature. That said, some of its findings have had a major impact, including a paper it released on [derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/10/derivatives-101.asp).

At the time, many people were skeptical of derivatives, citing a lack of understanding and the complexity of financial [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp), such as [forwards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp), [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp), [options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), [swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp), and other similar market contracts that derive their value from an [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp).

## History of the Group of 30 (G-30)

The G-30 was founded in 1978 by Geoffrey Bell, under directive and initial funding from the [Rockefeller](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/jd-rockefeller.asp) Foundation. Prior to the existence of the G-30, similar aims in understanding economic issues and crises was sought by an organization called the Bellagio Group.

The Bellagio Group, formed by Austrian economist Fritz Machlup, first met in the early 1960s to address international [currency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp) issues and the [balance of payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bop.asp) (BOP) crisis facing the United States at that time.

The G-30's first [chairman](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chairman.asp) was Johannes Witteveen, the former managing director of the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imf.asp) (IMF). As of 2019, the current chairman of the G-30 is Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a Singaporean economist and politician. Shanmugaratnam is the first Asian person to hold the post, which has a five-year term.
