Quasi-Public Corporation Definition
## What Is a Quasi-Public Corporation?

A quasi-public corporation is a company in the [private sector](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp) that is supported by the government with a public mandate to provide a given service. Examples include telegraph and telephone companies, oil and gas, water, and electric light companies, and irrigation companies.

Most quasi-public corporations began as government agencies, but have since become separate entities. They are often also referred to as public service corporations.

## How Quasi-Public Corporations Work

Like public-purpose corporations, such as public libraries and adult day centers, quasi-public corporations are created to benefit the public in some way. These private-operating companies are presented with a government-chartered mission and, in exchange for their services, usually receive some form of partial funding from the state.

Quasi-public corporations may comprise [public companies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp) of an industrial and commercial character, [nationalized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nationalization.asp) companies, and companies with majority public [shareholding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp). Many consider quasi-public institutions to be political policy tools because they can, in some instances, operate with fewer restrictions and greater cost-effectiveness than normal public institutions.

### Important

Contrary to popular opinion, employees of quasi-public corporations do not work for the government.

## Government Funding

For those [public-private corporations](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-publicly-and-privately-held-companies/) that receive some type of government funding, such [subsidies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp) consist of regular fund transfers intended to compensate for persistent losses, i.e. negative operating [surpluses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/surplus.asp).

Losses can be incurred as a result of charging prices which are lower than average [costs of production](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/production-cost.asp) as a matter of deliberate government economic and social policy; by convention, these subsidies are treated as subsidies on products.

## Special Considerations

It is not uncommon to see the [shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp) of this type of corporation trade on major [stock exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp), giving individual investors the opportunity to gain exposure to the company and any [profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp) it generates.

While shares of this type of corporation are sold publicly, creating value and profit for shareholders comes second to carrying out its public purpose. The operations of a quasi-public corporation must usually, in some way, contribute to the comfort, convenience, or welfare of the general public.

## Examples of a Quasi-Public Corporation

One example of a quasi-public purpose corporation is Sallie Mae Corp. ([SLM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=SLM)), which was founded to advance student loan development.

Another example is Fannie Mae, otherwise known as the [Federal National Mortgage Association](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/fannie-mae-loans/) (FNMA). Fannie Mae is regarded as a quasi-public corporation because it operates as an independent corporation. This company operates under a congressional [charter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/charter.asp) that aims to increase the availability and affordability of homeownership, but it is not treated as any part of the government.
