## What Is "Listed"?

"Listed" describes companies that are included and traded on a given [stock exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp). Most exchanges have specific requirements that companies must meet in order to be listed and continue to stay listed.

### Key Takeaways:

-   "Listed" is a term that describes a company that is included and on a given stock exchange so that its stock can be traded.
-   Companies must meet certain requirements and follow the rules of any exchange on which it is listed.
-   Companies tend to prefer to be listed on the major exchanges, such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, since they provide the most liquidity and visibility for a company's stock.

## Understanding the Term "Listed"

Companies are being added to a given exchange, such as the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp). Occasionally, companies that have not fulfilled all necessary listing requirements become [delisted](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delisting.asp) until they again meet the requirements. Generally, companies prefer to be listed on the major exchanges, such as the [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE) and Nasdaq since they provide the most [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) and visibility for a company's stock.

To be listed on Nasdaq, each company must meet at least one of four requirements and follow set rules.

### Requirements to be listed on the Nasdaq Exchange

Companies can qualify to be on the Nasdaq under different standards: [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) standard, market value of listed securities standard, or [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) standard. Broadly speaking, however, the main requirements include the following:

-   Companies must have a minimum of 1,000,000 publicly traded shares upon listing, excluding those held by officers, directors, or any [beneficial owners](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficialowner.asp) of more than 10% of the company.
-   In addition, the regular [bid price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bidprice.asp) at the time of listing must be at least $4, and there must be at least three [market makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) for the stock.
-   Companies may qualify under a [closing price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp) alternative of $3 or $2 if the company meets varying requirements.
-   Each company is also required to follow Nasdaq corporate governance rules 4350, 4351, and 4360.
-   Companies must have a market value of publicly held stock of $15,000,000 (or $5,000,000 if using the net income standard).

According to [The Street](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nasdaq-listing-requirements-15092402), the Nasdaq also requires companies to meet all of the criteria under at least one of the following standards:

-   **Earnings standard:** The company must have aggregate pre-tax earnings in the prior three years of at least $10 million, in the prior two years of at least $2 million, and no single year in the prior three years can have a [net loss](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netloss.asp).
-   **Capitalization with cash flow:** The company must have a minimum aggregate cash flow of at least $27.5 million for the past three fiscal years with no negative [cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) in any of those three years. In addition, the company's average [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) over the prior 12 months must be at least $550 million, and revenues in the previous [fiscal year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp) must be a minimum of $110 million.
-   **Capitalization with revenue:** Companies can be removed from the cash flow requirement of the second standard if their average market capitalization over the past 12 months is at least $850 million and revenues over the prior fiscal year are at least $90 million.
-   **Assets with equity:** Companies can eliminate the cash flow and revenue requirements, and decrease their marketing capitalization requirements to $160 million if their total [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) total at least $80 million and their stockholders' equity is at least $55 million.
