Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX)
## What Is the Hollywood Stock Exchange?

The Hollywood Stock Exchange is an online [prediction market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prediction-market.asp) in which "investors" bet on the performance of various components of the entertainment industry. The bets are made using credits called Moviestocks, Starbonds, TVStocks, Movie Funds, Idol Warrants, and derivatives. Trades are made in "Hollywood dollars," which players receive when they open an account, make successful trades and participate in the website's quizzes. Each "investment" has a ticker-like symbol: For example, the symbol for _Ironman 3_ is IRNM3.

## Understanding the Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX)

The Hollywood Stock Exchange game uses virtual specialist technology invented by Hollywood Stock Exchange co-founders and creators Max Keiser and Michael R. Burns. The exchange has been around since 1996 and is owned by Cantor Fitzgerald, which launched a real-world exchange similar to HSX, called the Cantor Exchange, in 2010.

Previous incarnations of the game included a music market (for purchasing musical artists), prizes for top gainers and, briefly, a "buyout" program in which the Hollywood Stock Exchange would reward top players by purchasing their portfolios at a price of $1 per $1 million of exchange currency if the player listed the portfolio for sale on eBay. These features have been discontinued. The practice of selling portfolios on eBay was inaugurated by Curtis Edmonds, a former Texas lawyer.

The Hollywood Stock Exchange attracted some [private investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateinvestmentfund.asp) during the dotcom boom and ran TV ads on cable channels in an effort to attract players. After the dotcom crash, the exchange was acquired by units of Cantor Fitzgerald. Cantor Fitzgerald has used the exchange’s Moviestock prices to assist its gambling operations in the United Kingdom, in which bettors can place wagers on how much money U.S. films will gross.
