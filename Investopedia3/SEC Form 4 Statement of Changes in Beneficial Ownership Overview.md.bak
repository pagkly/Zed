SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership Overview
## What Is SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership?

SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership is a document that must be filed with the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders consist of directors and officers of the company, as well as any shareholders, owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock. The forms ask about the reporting person's relationship to the company and about purchases and sales of such [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) shares.

The filing of Form 4 relates to Sections 16(a) and 23(a) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seact1934.asp), as well as Sections 30(h) and 38 of the [Investment Company Act of 1940](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentcompanyact.asp). Disclosure of information required on Form 4 is mandatory and becomes public record upon filing.

### Key Takeaways

-   Form 4 must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders.

## Understanding SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership

There are multiple SEC forms that are associated with the ownership of stocks or securities for publicly-traded companies. SEC Form 4 is one of three forms that is usually required by the SEC.1

### Form 3

Individuals file [Form 3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form3.asp) when they first acquire a stock and are registering the securities for the first time. The form must be filed within 10 days of the individual becoming an officer, director, or [beneficial owner](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficialowner.asp) at the company.

### Form 4

Form 4 is required to be filed by a company or the individual at the company when there is a change in the holdings of company insiders. Form 4 must be filed with the SEC within two days of the transaction. Form 4 is a two-page document, which covers any buy-and-sell orders, as well as the exercise of company stock options.

[Options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a certain price, and by a specific date. Options are often awarded to executives and directors of companies as part of the [employee incentive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eso.asp) plan. Typically, the options can be cashed out or redeemed after a predetermined holding period has expired.

### Form 5

[Form 5](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form5.asp) is filed if a person conducted a trade of the company's stock but failed to report it via Form 4. Form 5 allows the individual 45 days following the close of the company's fiscal year.

The SEC is able to use the information in SEC Form 4 when referring a case to other governmental authorities and [self-regulatory organizations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sro.asp) (SROs). If a party fails to disclose the required information on Form 4, civil or criminal actions could result.

## Forms Related to SEC Form 4

Several other forms are critical to maintaining transparency and recording the actions of public company executives, officers, and directors. These include the company's annual financial report, which is filed via a [10-K](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-k.asp) and the quarterly financial report filed via a [10-Q](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10q.asp).

If a company is issuing stock for the first time, they must file Form [S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp), and if any amendments must be made, they file Form S-1A. The [8-K](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/8-k.asp) is filed when there are unscheduled material events or corporate changes.

The SEC has the capacity to use information disclosed on Form 4 in investigations or litigation involving federal securities laws, in addition to other civil, criminal, or regulatory statutes or provisions.

## How to File SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership
