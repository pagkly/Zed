## Types of Safe Harbors

### Safe Harbor 401(k) Plans

Safe harbor [401(k) plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) feature simple, alternative methods for meeting non-discrimination requirements. Created by the 1996 Small Business Job Protection Act, these retirement accounts were created in response to the fact that many businesses were not setting up 401(k) plans for their employees because the non-discrimination policies were too difficult to understand. These 401(k) plans give the employer safe harbor from compliance concerns by providing them with a simplified product.

### Safe Harbor Accounting Method to Simplify Tax Returns

Typically, the [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) requires taxpayers to treat remodels as capitalized improvements, the value of which generally must be claimed slowly over a long period of time.

However, restaurants and retailers often remodel their facilities on a regular basis to help their businesses look fresh and engaging. As a result, the IRS allowed some restaurateurs and retailers the ability to claim these expenses as repair costs, which can then all be deducted as business expenses in the year they were incurred.

Safe harbor accounting methods to reduce taxes is not intended to avoid taxes, only to minimize them within the bounds of the law.

Because of this, tax filers had to review a long list of requirements to determine into which category their expenses fall, and the process was confusing. To eliminate confusion, the IRS created a safe harbor accounting method for eligible retail and restaurant businesses.

Essentially, these businesses can now choose if their remodeling costs fall into the repair or [capitalized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalize.asp) improvement categories. Due to this safe harbor, businesses don't have to worry about accidentally making the wrong selection and later being penalized for it.

## Example of a Safe Harbor

To illustrate a safe harbor accounting method that helps a tax filer sidestep a tax regulation, assume a firm is losing money and cannot thus claim an investment credit. It transfers the credit to a company that is profitable and can claim the credit. The profitable company leases the asset back to the unprofitable company and passes on the tax savings.
