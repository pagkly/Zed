EOS
## What Is EOS?

EOS is a [[blockchain]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp)\-based decentralized operating system that is designed to create, host, and support secure, decentralized autonomous applications ([dApps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp)) and [[smart contracts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp). In addition, EOS nodes subscribe to a "constitution" that binds them, via the blockchain, to the rules and regulations set forth by the EOS community.

Currently administered by the block.one organization, EOS was launched by Dan Larimer, who is also the founder and creator of established platforms like Bitshares and Steem.

As of February 2020, EOS is among the 20 most valuable blockchain tokens by market capitalization.1

### Key Takeaways

-   EOS is a blockchain-based platform intended to run decentralized applications and smart contracts.
-   Unlike most other blockchain systems, EOS nodes are bound to the rules and mandates of a "constitution" that each node digitally signs and records on the blockchain.
-   Like many smart-contract platforms, EOS utilizes two tokens, EOS and EOS.IO.

## Understanding EOS

Blockchain-based dApps can be commercial or focused on individual users, and work in a way similar to web-based apps. The EOS platform supports all required features for developing, hosting, and using the dApps, like providing secure access and authentication, permissioning, data hosting, usage management, and communication between the dApps and the Internet.

No official full form exists for EOS, and the creators have decided not to formally define it themselves. Compared to the web-based apps platform, the EOS offers a lot of advantages.

Leveraging the scalability potential of blockchain, it is capable of processing large numbers of transactions in parallel. Its ownership structure eliminates transaction charges as users are permitted to utilize resources in proportion to their stake instead of the standard [[pay-per-transaction]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction-fees.asp) model. This also makes it easier for app developers to predict hosting costs.2

EOS uses delegated [[proof-of-stake]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp) concept, which allows flexibility to make instant high-level decisions, like rollback and bug fixing, through a majority accord among designated stakeholders.2

## EOS.IO and EOS Tokens

The EOS ecosystem utilizes two key elements: the EOS.IO and the EOS tokens. To draw a parallel, EOS.IO is akin to the operating system of a computer—it manages and controls the EOS blockchain network. EOS.IO uses blockchain architecture that is built to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. The EOS token is the [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) of the EOS network.

A developer simply needs to hold EOS coins, instead of spending them, to be eligible to use network resources and to build and run dApps. A token holder who is not running any apps can also allocate or rent his bandwidth to other participants who may need it.

## The EOS Constitution

EOS achieves decentralized governance utilizing peer-to-peer terms of a binding contract among its participants, referred to as its "constitution," theoretically similar in many ways to the governing documents established by nation-states.3 According to the EOS whitepaper:

> The content of this constitution defines obligations among the users which cannot be entirely enforced by code and facilitates dispute resolution by establishing jurisdiction and choice of law along with other mutually accepted rules. Every transaction broadcast on the network must incorporate the hash of the constitution as part of the signature and thereby explicitly binds the signer to the contract. 4

The EOS techno-society is so ordered mutually through technological and social relations.
