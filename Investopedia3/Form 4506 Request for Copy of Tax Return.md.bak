A tax return transcript is a computer printout of your income tax return information. It shows filing dates, filing status, dependents, [adjusted gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp), and tax liability. In fact, it shows most line items contained on your return as it was originally filed. It doesn't show changes made after the return was processed.3

You file Form 4506-T when you need a transcript of your tax return or tax account information, [Form W-2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w2form.asp) information, and [1099 information](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082514/purpose-1099-forms.asp). Tax return transcripts are available for the current and past three tax years and only for the following returns: Form 1040 series (Forms 1040, [1040-A](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040a.asp), [1040-EZ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040ez.asp), or [1040-X](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form1040x.asp)), Form 1120 series (Forms 1120, 1120-A, 1120-H, 1120-L, or [1120-S](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-1120s.asp)), and [Form 1065](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-1065.asp). If you register online with the IRS, you can get it right away and free of charge.

An individual tax return transcript of your previously filed and processed 1040 series tax return can also be requested free of charge using the simplified Form 4506-T-EZ.

If you need your tax information right away, you can also get a transcript of it free of charge by using the IRS's online tool "[Get Transcript](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript)" or by calling the IRS at 1-800-908-9946. Transcripts are accepted as a substitute for an exact copy of a return by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, by student loan and mortgage lending agencies, and by other third parties seeking to verify taxpayer income. In fact, the tax return transcript was created specifically to the satisfy mortgage lender's demands for the tax return information of their borrowers.1 3

As of 2019, the IRS has a new transcript format that protects against identity theft and fraud. Only the last four digits of your [Social Security Number](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssn.asp) and telephone number are visible, for example. Taxpayers can still request an unmasked version, but it will only be mailed to their address of record.4

When paper-filing any of the Form 4506 series, copies and transcripts of [jointly filed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointreturn.asp) tax returns may be requested by either spouse, and only one signature is required. When using Get Transcript online, either the primary or secondary spouse on a joint return can make the request. When using Get Transcript by mail phone, only the primary taxpayer on the return can make the request.3
