## What Is a Rating?

A rating is an assessment tool assigned by an analyst or rating agency to a stock or bond. The rating assigned indicates the stock or bond's level of investment opportunity. The three major rating agencies are [Standard & Poor's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp), [Moody's Investors Service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moodys.asp), and [Fitch Ratings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fitch-ratings.asp). 

### Key Takeaways

-   A rating is an assessment tool assigned by an analyst or rating agency to a stock or bond.
-   The three major bond rating agencies are Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings.
-   Bond ratings evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuer or insurer, which can be interpreted as direct measure of the chances of default.
-   For stocks, buy-side and sell-side analysts will do research and then write an opinion of the stocks they cover, which will include a rating such as _buy_, _hold_, or _sell_.

## How a Rating Works

Analysts that work on both the [buy-side](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyside.asp) and [sell-side](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sellside.asp) of the industry research stocks and write opinions on those stocks, which will often include a rating such as _buy_, _hold_ or _sell_. Meanwhile, bonds are rated by the three major [bond rating agencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-rating-agencies.asp). 

A company can improve its rating score by maintaining as little debt as possible and staying vigilant when sudden changes occur within the company.

## Types of Ratings

### Analyst Ratings

Analysts on the buy-side will write opinions for their teams for the purposes of informing portfolio management decisions. Analysts on the sell-side will write opinions to educate others on their research and in an attempt to sell particular stocks on behalf of clients. For a stock, an analyst may assign a _buy_, _hold_, or _sell_ rating and an explanation of why they recommend this action for the stock. 

When it comes to major Wall Street banks and institutions, they all use different terminology and classifications. Morgan Stanley, for example, uses the terms _overweight_, _equal-weight_, and _underweight_. The timeline for its ratings is 12 to 18 months.1 Credit Suisse uses the terms _outperform_, _neutral_, and _underperform_, which is based on a 12-month time period.2 All of these terms are variations of the _buy_, _hold_, and _sell_ ratings.

### Rating Agency Ratings 

For a bond, a rating agency will assess the bond's relative safety based upon the issuing entity's fundamental financial picture, which scrutinizes the issuer's [ability to repay](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ability-to-repay.asp) the principal and make interest [payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payment.asp).

The ratings for Moody's and S&P from highest to lowest in the investment grade category are Aaa/AAA, Aa1/AA+, Aa2/AA, Aa3/AA-, A1/A+, A2/A, A3/A-, Baa1/BBB+, Baa2/BBB and Baa3/BBB-.3 4

Standard & Poor's is the provider of the [S&P 500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp), as well as a leading data source and index provider of independent credit ratings. S&P 500 Index is a widely utilized gauge for determining the overall health of the U.S. stock market.5

Moody's is a provider of international financial research on government and commercial issued bonds. Moody's utilizes a rating system to judge a borrower's creditworthiness. This rating scale goes starts at Aaa (being of the highest quality) and goes to C (being of the lowest quality).3

Fitch Ratings is also a credit rating agency that is international. This agency bases its ratings on factors such as how sensitive a company is to internal changes and the kind of debt the company holds.6 Fitch is used by investors as a guide to what investments will not default and will, in turn, lead to a solid return.

The ratings assigned by the various rating agencies are based primarily upon the insurer's or issuer's creditworthiness. This rating can, therefore, be interpreted as a direct measure of the probability of [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp). However, credit stability and priority of payment are also factored into the rating.
