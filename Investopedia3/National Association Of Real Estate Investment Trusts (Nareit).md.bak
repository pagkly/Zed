Nareit represents a diverse industry that includes commercial equity REITs, mortgage REITs, REITs traded on major stock exchanges, public non-listed REITs and private REITs, which collectively own nearly $3 trillion worth of real estate assets. Its mission is to advocate for REIT-based real estate investment with policymakers and the global investment community and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from real estate investment.

Based in Washington, D.C., Nareit works as a lobbyist for the industry when dealing with legislators and policymakers from America and around the world. It is run by an independent executive board led by President and CEO Steven A. Wechsler.

On the next day, September 15, 1960, the National Association of Real Estate was incorporated, which later evolved into the organization now known as Nareit. It has since partnered with several foreign entities in its political endeavors, namely the British FTSE Group and the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA). Together, these groups have established the FTSE EPRA/ Nareit Global Real Estate Index Series, which highlights general trends in eligible real estate equities worldwide. In October 2016, Nareit created a [Real Estate Sustainability Council (RESC)](https://www.reit.com/nareit/reits-sustainability) to increase its focus on promoting sustainability and environmental, social and governance best practices.
