## Understanding Google Blogger

Google Blogger–also just called Blogger–is an online content management system (CMS) that facilitates the creation of informal online discussion sites, also called blogs. Users can get a free blogspot.com domain or buy a custom domain. Users can also customize their blogs with different templates, flexible layouts, and hundreds of background images. In order to use Blogger, users must create a Google account. (Individuals with existing Gmail email addresses can use this account.) Users can customize the name of their account; the format is displayed as \[LoremIpsum\].blogspot.com. Users are also able to create multiple blogs under one account.

Although its popularity in the United States has waned, Google Blogger has a large international user base and is popular in countries such as Indonesia, India, and Brazil. The service is available in over 60 languages. In April 2020, Blogger had approximately [78.74 million visitors to its site](https://www.similarweb.com/website/blogger.com).

Content is hosted on Cloud Spanner, Google's database service that was released in 2017. Blogger is also integrated with other Google programs, such as Google AdSense and Google Analytics. Users can use Google AdSense to automatically display relevant targeted ads so that users are able to make money through their own Google Blogger site.

Users must sign up for an AdSense account separately, and then link advertisements to their individual blogs. Not all blogs qualify for advertisements, so interested users should double-check the eligibility checklist. Blogger has its own built-in analytics tools that help users identify where their audience is coming from and what they’re interested in. Users can also connect their blog directly to Google Analytics for more detailed information.

Users control the features of Blogger through the program's dashboard. The dashboard displays the blog's activity, news from Google, or any updates to the program. Users can manage a particular blog by clicking the blog title and editing it. They can also create new posts from the dashboard. Blogger websites can be viewed and accessed from a desktop or a mobile platform. Users can email their posts to your blog; with email posting, you can use your mobile device to post to your blog. The mobile application Blogger Mobile allows users to post pictures directly to their Blogger account from their mobile device.

Although there are blogging tools with more complex and sophisticated features available, the fact that Blogger is free and offers some level of customization for users makes it an attractive system for individuals who may be novices at blogging.

When Blogger was first started by Pyra Labs in 1999, it was one of the first blog-publishing tools on the Internet. It was founded by Evan Williams, one of the co-founders of Twitter, and Meg Hourihan, one of the co-founders of Kinja. The company has been credited with helping to popularize the blog format of sharing content on the Internet.

Google acquired Blogger in 2003 when it purchased Pyra Labs for an undisclosed amount of money. After the acquisition, the CMS underwent a major redesign in 2004 and some of Blogger's premium services became free.
