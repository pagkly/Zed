Rate of Change (ROC)
## What is Rate of Change (ROC)

The rate of change (ROC) is the speed at which a variable changes over a specific period of time. ROC is often used when speaking about [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp), and it can generally be expressed as a ratio between a change in one variable relative to a corresponding change in another; graphically, the rate of change is represented by the slope of a line. The ROC is often illustrated by the Greek letter delta.

## Understanding Rate of Change (ROC)

Rate of change is used to mathematically describe the percentage change in value over a defined period of time, and it represents the momentum of a variable. The calculation for ROC is simple in that it takes the current value of a stock or [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp) and divides it by the value from an earlier period. Subtract one and multiply the resulting number by 100 to give it a percentage representation.

ROC\=(current valueprevious value−1)∗100ROC = (\\frac{\\text{current value}}{\\text{previous value}} - 1)\*100

## The Importance of Measuring Rate of Change

Rate of change is an extremely important financial concept because it allows investors to spot security momentum and other [trends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp). For example, a security with high momentum, or one that has a positive ROC, normally outperforms the market in the short term. Conversely, a security that has a ROC that falls below its [moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp), or one that has a low or negative ROC is likely to decline in value and can be seen as a [sell signal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sell-signal.asp) to investors.

Rate of change is also a good indicator of market [bubbles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp). Even though momentum is good and traders look for securities with a positive ROC, if a broad-market [ETF](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp), index, or [mutual fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) has a sharp increase in its ROC in the short term, it may be a sign that the market is unsustainable. If the ROC of an index or other broad-market security is over 50%, investors should be wary of a bubble.

## Rate of Change and Its Relationship With Price

The rate of change is most often used to measure the change in a security's price over time. This is also known as the [price rate of change](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricerateofchange.asp) (ROC). The price rate of change can be derived by taking the price of a security at time B minus the price of the same security at time A and dividing that result by the price at time A.

Price ROC\=B−AA×100where:B\=price at current timeA\=price at previous time\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Price ROC} = \\frac{B - A}{A} \\times 100 \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &B=\\text{price at current time}\\\\ &A=\\text{price at previous time}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

This is important because many traders pay close attention to the speed at which one price changes relative to another. For example, [option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) traders study the relationship between the rate of change in the price of an option relative to a small change in the price of the underlying asset, known as an options delta.
