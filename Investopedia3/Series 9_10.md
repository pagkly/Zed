Series 9/10
## What is Series 9/10

Series 9/10 refers to a two-part securities exam and license entitling the holder to supervise sales activities at a general securities-oriented [[branch office]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/branch-office.asp). Before taking the Series 9/10 Exam, also known as the General Securities Sales Supervisor Qualification Examination, a candidate must have a [[Series 7]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series7.asp) license.1

The Series 9/10 covers topics such as the supervision of [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) and general securities sales and trading practices in primary and secondary markets. The Series 9/10 exams are administered by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp) and were formerly known as the Series 8 Exam. As the name would suggest, the exam is broken into two parts; the Series 9 is the shorter and covers options sales and trading, as well as regulation and administration. Series 10 represents a deeper dive into a similar but broader range of topics and requirements.2

## Series 9/10 Permitted Activities

The Series 9/10 is designed to protect the investing public by measuring the competency of General Securities Sales Supervisors and ensuring their expertise in the following areas:

Sale of corporate securities; Rights; Warrants; Closed-end funds; Money market funds; REITs; Asset-backed securities; Mortgage-backed securities (corporate); Equity options; Options on (corporate) backed securities; Mutual funds; Variable annuities and variable life insurance; Government securities; Repos and certificates of accrual on government securities; Direct participation programs.3

## Series 9/10 Eligibility

Series 9/10 candidates must be registered with a FINRA [[member firm]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/memberfirm.asp) or other self-regulatory organization, and must already have passed the Series 7 General Securities Representative test. 2

## Series 9/10 Test Content

The Series 9/10 Exam consists of 215 multiple-choice questions in four major content areas, 60 questions for the Series 9 and 145 questions for the Series 10. This total includes 15 unscored questions randomly placed in each part (five in the Series 9 and 10 in the Series 10). Candidates are allocated 90 minutes to finish the Series 9 and four hours to complete the Series 10. There is no penalty for guessing so candidates should endeavor to answer every question. The test is administered via computer and a score of 70% is required to pass. For more on the exam, see FINRA's Content Outline for the Series 9/10.4

## The Difference Between Series 9/10 and Series 24

Both Series 9/10 and 24 are the exams that must be completed by a [principal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp) before they can undertake certain sales activities.

According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a principal who has completed the [Series 24](https://www.investopedia.com/professionals/series24/default.asp) examination is qualified to supervise the following sales activities:

"Corporate securities; rights; warrants; closed-end funds; money market funds; REITS; asset-backed securities; (corporate) mortgage-backed securities; mutual funds; variable annuities and variable life insurance; direct participation programs; securities traders; venture capital; mergers and acquisitions; and corporate financing."1

FINRA indicates that a principal who has completed the Series 24 exam is also qualified to supervise, in addition to sales, the overall investment banking and securities business of a member firm.

Completion of the Series 9/10 examination, which covers more terrain, qualifies a principal (excluding securities [traders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) and those involved in venture capital; [mergers and acquisitions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) and corporate financing) to supervise sales in all of the above, as well as the following: [equity options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp); options on \[corporate\] [mortgage-backed securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp); government securities; repos and certificates of [accrual](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruals.asp) on government securities; municipal securities, and municipal fund securities.1
