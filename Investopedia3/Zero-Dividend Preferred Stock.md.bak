## Understanding Zero-Dividend Preferred Stock

Preferred stock usually does not have [voting rights](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp), whereas common stock does.

Owners of zero-dividend [preference shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preference-shares.asp) will not receive a normal dividend but they will still maintain reimbursement priority over [common shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common_shareholder.asp) in the event of a bankruptcy. In such an event, they will get a fixed sum that was agreed upon in advance.

Zero-dividend preferred stock is comparable in some ways to [zero-coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp), though they are regarded as lower tier than bonds. Still, they do have upper-tier preference compared with common shareholders if a bankruptcy occurs. This type of stock is usually backed by the issuer’s assets and can be part of split capital investment trusts as a sort of share to produce fixed capital growth in a defined period.

## Why Zero-Dividend Preferred Stock Is Issued

Issuing zero-dividend preferred stock is a way for an investment trust to raise [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) that is easier than seeking a loan from a bank, and oftentimes lasts much longer than a bank would typically be willing to lend for. Zero-dividend preferred stock also comes with fewer restrictions than a bank would include in a loan.
