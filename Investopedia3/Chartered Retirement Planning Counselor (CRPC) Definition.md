## What Is a Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor (CRPC)?

A Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor (CRPC) is someone with a professional financial planning designation awarded by the College for Financial Planning. Individuals may earn the CRPC designation by completing a study program and passing a final multiple-choice examination. Successful applicants earn the right to use the CRPC designation with their names for two years, which can improve job opportunities, professional reputation, and pay. Every two years, CRPC professionals must complete 16 hours of continuing education and pay a small fee to continue using the designation.1

## Understanding Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor (CRPC)

CRPCs are different from [[Certified Financial Planners]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfp.asp) (CFP). The latter provides financial planning across all aspects of an individual's life. CRPCs are focused on retirement planning. The CRPC program is developed with a focus on client-centered problem-solving. Applicants gain in-depth knowledge of individuals' needs both before and after retirement. The College for Financial Planning describes the program as helping financial planners and advisers define and create a "road map for retirement" for their clients.2 The study program to become a CRPC covers the entire [[retirement planning]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement-planning.asp) process, including meeting multiple financial objectives, sources of retirement income, personal savings, employer-sponsored retirement plans, [[income taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp), retirement cash flow, [[asset management]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetmanagement.asp), [[estate planning]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp), and more.

Individuals who have earned the CRPC designation report a 9% increase in earnings, according to the college.2 With it, graduates can test out of two out of the six courses in the college's CFP Certified Professional Education Program. Completing the course can also provide up to 45 hours of continuing education credits.2
