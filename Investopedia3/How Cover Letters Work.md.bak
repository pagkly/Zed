How Cover Letters Work
## What Is a Cover Letter?

A [cover letter](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/083115/financial-analyst-cover-letters-get-you-hired.asp) is a written document commonly submitted with a job application outlining the applicant's credentials and interest in the open position. Since a cover letter is often one of only two documents sent to a potential employer, a well- or poorly-written letter can impact whether the applicant is called for an [interview](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/010516/4-things-you-should-never-reveal-during-job-interview.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A cover letter is commonly submitted with a job application explaining the applicant's credentials and interest in the position.
-   A good cover letter complements the resume and explains why the candidate is the ideal person for the job.
-   Common cover letter mistakes can sink a job applicant.

## Understanding Cover Letters

Most [job postings](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0711/9-different-ways-to-find-a-new-job.aspx) are done online and no longer require a physical application. Instead, applicants send companies a copy of their [resume](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/10/investment-banking-resume.asp) along with a cover letter either by email or with a hard copy through the mail. A resume offers a glimpse into the professional and academic experience of a potential employee. The cover letter, on the other hand, acts as an introduction written by the candidate to express their interest in the position and what makes them the best fit for the job.

A good cover letter complements a resume by expanding on items relevant to the job. In essence, it's a sales pitch that describes why the applicant is the best person for the position. Career experts advise job seekers to spend time customizing each cover letter for the particular position, rather than using a generic missive. Although this requires extra effort, it can be very helpful in allowing an applicant to stand out above the competition.

The cover letter provides information to the employer about who the candidate is as a professional. This includes their job interests, professional goals, knowledge, the skills they've gained over the years, and their career goals and achievements. The cover letter should be a one-page document that provides clear and concise details as to why the candidate wants the job.

## Special Considerations

Writing a cover letter doesn't have to be tedious—even though it may seem like it's a chore. Here are a few simple tips you may want to consider when composing your cover letter:

-   **Personalize your letter for each role.** Never use a generic cover letter. This means you have to write a new one for each position. Be sure to include your strengths and skills, and explain why you’re the perfect candidate.
-   **Include contact information.** If the posting doesn't include the hiring manager's name, call the [company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/company.asp), or check its website. Including this person's name gives your letter a proper greeting and also shows you have initiative. And don't forget to add your contact information, too. This is important if your resume gets separated from your cover letter.
-   **Simplify your letter.** Communicate clearly and concisely. Using complex words and sentences would most certainly fail to convey your intentions with the company and the person reading the letter probably won't bother with the rest of your application.
-   **Be specific when needed.** Don't rehash your resume, so be sure to quantify your accomplishments. For instance, expand on your marketing experience in your cover letter by saying you brought in 200 additional clients each month and increased revenue to $10,000. This can set you apart from candidates with vague personal details.
-   **Proofread.** After you’ve written the letter, go over it a few times to ensure there are no errors. Then ask someone else to do a once-over and recommend any changes you may need to make.

A simple, focused cover letter without any typos or grammatical errors will get you noticed by potential employers.

A perfect resume can often be sabotaged by a poorly thought-out cover letter or one that is laden with mistakes. Whether you include the letter as per required submission guidelines, or you simply want to emphasize your interest in the job, make sure you avoid making these blunders.

-   **Names matter.** This includes the name of the hiring manager, the company, and yes, even yours. Make sure you have the right names and the correct spelling. And don't forget to change the names if you're using the same cover letter for multiple jobs.
-   **Restating your resume.** Since the cover letter is used to [identify your skills](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/10/sell-your-skills.asp) and explain how your previous experience is applicable to the desired position, don't restate the stuff on your resume. Remember, the cover letter should complement your resume, not just summarize it.
-   **Keep your letter tight.** [Recruiters](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/headhunter.asp) often go through hundreds of applications and don't have time to read through a three-page missive. The absolute maximum length for a cover letter should be one page, with a few concise paragraphs.
-   **Omit unnecessary details.** Stay on topic. There's no need to mention your graphic-design skills if you're applying for an accounting position. It's a good idea to leave out personal things like your IQ, recreational accomplishments, interests, and hobbies. That is unless they relate to the job or company.
-   **Avoid sounding arrogant.** Ensure your cover letter does not make you appear [arrogant](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-careers/09/10-coworker-personality-conflicts.asp). While the cover letter is about you and your accomplishments, find a way of saying "I'm the best" without actually saying it. Avoid overusing words like "I," "me," or "my."
-   **Rember that spelling counts.** Typos and grammatical errors show you didn't even bother to proofread your own letter. And be consistent—don't convey a dash with "--" in one place and "—" in another.
