Guerrilla Marketing
## What Is Guerrilla Marketing?

Guerrilla marketing is a [marketing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp) tactic in which a company uses surprise and/or unconventional interactions in order to promote a product or service. Guerrilla marketing is different than traditional marketing in that it often relies on personal interaction, has a smaller budget, and focuses on smaller groups of promoters that are responsible for getting the word out in a particular location rather than through widespread media campaigns.

### Key Takeaways

-   Guerrilla marketing is the creating use of novel or unconventional methods in order to boost sales or attract interest in a brand or business.
-   These methods are often low- or no-cost and involve the widespread use of more personal interactions or through viral social media messaging.

## Guerrilla Marketing Explained

Connection to the emotions of a consumer is key to guerrilla marketing.

Guerrilla marketing takes place in public places that offer as big an audience as possible, such as streets, concerts, public parks, sporting events, festivals, beaches, and shopping centers. One key element of guerrilla marketing is choosing the right time and place to conduct a campaign so as to avoid potential legal issues. Guerrilla marketing can be indoor, outdoor, an "event ambush," or experiential, meant to get the public to interact with a brand.
