Reimbursement
## What Is Reimbursement?

Reimbursement is compensation paid by an organization for [out-of-pocket](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofpocket.asp) expenses incurred or overpayment made by an employee, customer, or another party. Reimbursement of [business expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessexpenses.asp), insurance costs, and overpaid taxes are common examples. However, unlike typical compensation, reimbursement is not subject to taxation.1

### Key Takeaways

-   Reimbursement is money paid to an employee or customer, or another party, as repayment for a business expense, insurance, taxes, or other costs. 
-   Business expense reimbursements include out-of-pocket expenses, such as those for travel and food. 
-   Per diem rates are daily rates paid to employees as reimbursement for business trips. 
-   Tax refunds are a form of reimbursement.
-   Organizations have a vested interest in ensuring that reimbursements are only provided for legitimate reasons.

## Understanding Reimbursement

Reimbursement is most commonly associated with business expenses. Many companies have policies outlining when they will reimburse employees for out-of-pocket expenses. Typically, these expenses are related to travel and can include the costs associated with hotels, food, ground transportation, and flights (travel reimbursement). Companies may also reimburse employees for other types of expenses, such as tuition reimbursement for college courses or continuing education classes.

## Types of Reimbursement

### Insurance

Beyond business expenses, reimbursement is also used in the [insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp) industry. When a health insurance policyholder needs urgent medical attention, the policyholder is unlikely to have the time to contact the insurer to determine the extent to which the policy covers expenses. The policyholder may have to pay for medication, medical services, or related expenses out-of-pocket. 

Alternatively, the insurance policy may require that the policyholder cover certain expenses out-of-pocket before seeking reimbursement. This is common in the case of fitness reimbursement. An insurer may reimburse up to a certain amount each year if a policyholder pays for and actively participates in a fitness program at a qualified fitness center. In both cases, the party that paid for the expenses out-of-pocket can seek reimbursement from the insurance company for any incurred expenses covered under the insurance policy. 

### Taxes

Reimbursement is also common with taxes paid to state and federal governments. Most income taxpayers have federal taxes withheld each pay period through [payroll deductions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payroll-deduction-plan.asp), which does not take into account the credits that a taxpayer may be entitled to due to other taxes paid or expenditures made.2 Contractors pay their taxes in quarterly [estimated tax payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estimated-tax.asp).3 [Tax refunds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-refund.asp) provided to the taxpayer by the government are a form of reimbursement, as the money being returned to the taxpayer is due to a previous overpayment.

### Legal

A type of reimbursement called reimbursement [alimony](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alimony.asp) applies to the legal sector. Reimbursement alimony is ordered by a judge and is a payment made to an ex-spouse as reimbursement for time and money invested in the spouse's financial prospects and growth. A person in a divorce settlement who worked full time to support his or her spouse through college may be entitled to reimbursement alimony if the spouse has graduated and is now earning income.

## Requirements for Reimbursement

In the U.S., companies often use the [per diem rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-diem-payments.asp) created by the General Services Administration (GSA). The GSA compiles reimbursement rates for various cities and sates.4 The company may also choose to use its own methodology to set per diem rates by taking the GSA per diem rate as a base point and adjusting it factoring in company-specific factors. For example, a company may want to set a higher reimbursement rate for executives or salespeople who entertain clients. Companies may also choose to provide employees with a fixed per diem rate.

## Special Considerations

Organizations, whether businesses, insurers, or governments, have a vested interest in ensuring that reimbursements are only provided for legitimate reasons. Employees, insurance policyholders, and taxpayers can file for an expense that never occurred or inflate the value of an expense. This requires the reimbursing organization to develop [internal control](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internalcontrols.asp) processes in an attempt to catch fraudulent reimbursement requests.

Another situation where a company could find itself reimbursing a fraudulent expense occurs in the banking industry. For example, if an account holder falls victim to [identity theft](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/identitytheft.asp) or a [data breach](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-breach.asp). In this case, the bank would run an investigation to ensure that the account was indeed compromised before it reimburses the client for any funds withdrawn from the account holder's debit or credit account.
