Volume Price Trend Indicator (VPT)
## What is a Volume Price Trend Indicator (VPT)?

The volume price trend (VPT) indicator helps determine a security’s price direction and strength of price change. The indicator consists of a cumulative volume line that adds or subtracts a multiple of the [percentage change](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percentage-change.asp) in a share price’s trend and current volume, depending upon the security’s upward or downward movements.

## Example of the Volume Price Trend Indicator

## Understanding Volume Price Trend Indicator (VPT)

The volume price trend indicator is used to determine the balance between a security’s demand and supply. The percentage change in the share price [trend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp) shows the relative supply or demand of a particular security, while volume indicates the force behind the trend. The VPT indicator is similar to the [on-balance volume (OBV) indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp) in that it measures cumulative volume and provides traders with information about a security’s money flow. Most charting software packages have the VPT indicator included.

## Trading with the Volume Price Trend Indicator

_Signal Line Crossovers:_ A [signal line](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signal_line.asp), which is just a moving average of the indicator, can be applied and used to generate trading signals. For example, a trader may buy a stock when the VPT line crosses above its signal line and sell when the VPT line passes below its signal line.

_Confirmations:_ The VPT indicator can be used in conjunction with moving averages and the [average directional index (ADX)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adx.asp) to confirm trending markets. For instance, a trader could buy a stock if the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average and accompanied by rising VPT indicator values. Conversely, the trader may decide to sell if the 20-day moving average is below the 50-day [moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) and the indicator’s values are falling.

The ADX also measures trend and [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) and can be used with the VPT indicator to confirm that a market is trending. ADX readings above 25 indicate that a security is trending, while readings below 25 indicate sideways price action. Therefore, a [trader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) could buy when the ADX is above 25 and the VPT line is above its signal line. They could sell when the ADX has a value below 25 and the VPT line is below its signal line.

_Divergence:_ Traders can use the VPT indicator to spot technical divergence. Divergence occurs when the indicator makes a higher high or a lower low, but the security’s price makes a lower high or a higher low. Traders should place a [stop-loss order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) above the most recent swing high or below the most recent swing low to minimize risk.
