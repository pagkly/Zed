Expected Return Definition
## What Is Expected Return?

The expected return is the profit or loss that an [investor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) anticipates on an investment that has known historical [rates of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) (RoR). It is calculated by multiplying potential outcomes by the chances of them occurring and then totaling these results. Expected return calculations are a key piece of both business operations and financial theory, including in the well-known models of modern portfolio theory ([MPT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp)) or the [black-scholes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp) options pricing model.

For example, if an investment has a 50% chance of gaining 20% and a 50% chance of losing 10%, the expected return would be 5% = (50% x 20% + 50% x -10% = 5%).

### Key Takeaways

-   The expected return is the amount of profit or loss an investor can anticipate receiving on an investment.
-    An expected return is calculated by multiplying potential outcomes by the odds of them occurring and then totaling these results.
-   Essentially a long-term weighted average of historical results, expected returns are not guaranteed.

## How Expected Return Works

The expected return is a tool used to determine whether an investment has a positive or negative average net outcome. The sum is calculated as the [expected value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expected-value.asp) (EV) of an investment given its potential returns in different scenarios, as illustrated by the following formula:

> Expected Return = SUM (Return i x Probability i)

where: "i" indicates each known return and its respective probability in the series

The expected return is usually based on historical data and is therefore not guaranteed into the future; however, it does often set reasonable expectations. Therefore, the expected return figure can be though of as a long-term weighted average of [historical returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historical-returns.asp).

In the formulation above, for instance, the 5% expected return may never be realized in the future, as the investment is inherently subject to [systematic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp) and [unsystematic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsystematicrisk.asp) risks. Systematic risk the danger to a market sector or the entire market whereas unsystematic risk applies to a specific company or industry.

When considering individual investments or portfolios, a more formal equation for expected return of a financial investment is:

Expected return = risk free premium + Beta (expected market return - risk free premium).  Investopedia

where:

-   ra = expected return;
-   rf \= the [risk-free rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp);
-   β = the investment's [beta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp); and
-   rm =the expected market return

In essence, this formula states that the expected return in excess of the risk-free rate of return depends on the investment's beta, or relative volatility compared to the broader market.

Expected return is not absolute, as it is a projection and not a realized return.

## Limitations of Expected Return

Note that it can be quite dangerous to make naive investment decisions based entirely on expected return calculations. Before making any investment decisions, one should always [review the risk characteristics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp) of investment opportunities to determine if the investments align with their portfolio goals.

For example, assume two hypothetical investments exist. Their annual performance results for the last five years are:

-   _Investment A:_ 12%, 2%, 25%, -9%, and 10%
-   _Investment B_: 7%, 6%, 9%, 12%, and 6%

Both of these investments have expected returns of exactly 8%. However, when analyzing the risk of each, as defined by the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp), Analyst use standard deviation to reveal historical volatility in investments. Investment A is approximately five times riskier than Investment B. That is, Investment A has a standard deviation of 12.6% and Investment B has a standard deviation of 2.6%.

In addition to expected returns, wise investors should also consider the likelihood of a return to better assess risk. After all, one can find instances where certain [lotteries](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lottery.asp) offer a positive expected return, despite the very low chances of realizing that return.

Pros

-   Gages the performance of an asset
    
-   Weighs different scenarios
    

Cons

-   Doesn't take risk into account
    
-   Based largely on historic data
    

## Real World Example of Expected Return

The expected return does not just apply to a single [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) or asset. It can also be expanded to analyze a portfolio containing many investments. If the expected return for each investment is known, the portfolio's overall [expected return](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/how-do-i-calculate-expected-return-my-portfolio-excel.asp) is a weighted average of the expected returns of its components.

For example, let's assume we have an investor interested in the tech sector. His portfolio contains the following stocks:

-   Alphabet Inc., ([GOOG)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=goog): $500,000 invested and an expected return of 15%
-   Apple Inc. ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)): $200,000 invested and an expected return of 6%
-   Amazon.com Inc. ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn)): $300,000 invested and an expected return of 9%

With a total portfolio value of $1 million the weights of Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon in the portfolio are 50%, 20%, and 30%, respectively.

Thus, the expected return of the total portfolio is 11.4%:

-   (50% x 15% = 7.5%) + (20% x 6% = 1.2%) + (30% x 9% = 2.7%)
-   (7.5% + 1.2% + 2.7% = 11.4%)

## Expected Return vs. Standard Deviation

Expected return and [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) are two statistical measures that can be used to analyze a portfolio. The expected return of a portfolio is the anticipated amount of returns that a portfolio may generate, making it the mean (average) of the portfolio's possible return distribution; whereas the standard deviation of a portfolio measures the amount that the returns deviate from its mean, making it a proxy for the portfolio's risk.
