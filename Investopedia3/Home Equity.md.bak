Home Equity
## What Is Home Equity?

Home equity is the value of a homeowner’s interest in their home. In other words, it is the real property’s current market value (less any liens that are attached to that property). The amount of equity in a house—or its value—fluctuates over time as more payments are made on the [mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) and market forces impact the current value of the property.

### Key Takeaways

-   Home equity is the value of the homeowner’s interest in their home.
-   An owner can leverage their home equity in the form of collateral to secure either a home equity loan, a traditional home equity line of credit (HELOC), or a fixed-rate HELOC.
-   A large down payment on a home (over 20%) will immediately provide a homeowner with more equity in their home than a smaller down payment.

## How Home Equity Works

If a portion—or all—of a home, is purchased via a mortgage loan, the lending institution has an interest in the home until the loan obligation has been met. Home equity is the portion of a home's current value that the owner actually possesses at any given time.

Equity in a house is initially acquired with the down payment you make during the initial purchase of the property. After that, more equity is achieved through your [mortgage payments](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-calculator-5084794), since a contracted portion of that payment will be assigned to bring down the outstanding principal you still owe on the loan. You can also benefit from property value [appreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appreciation.asp) because it will cause your equity value to increase.

Home equity is an asset; it is considered a portion of an individual's net worth, but it is not a liquid asset.

## Special Considerations

### Home Equity Loans

Unlike other investments, home equity cannot be quickly converted into cash. The equity calculation is based on a current market value [appraisal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp) of your property. But that appraisal is no guarantee that the property would sell at that price. 

However, an owner can leverage their home equity as collateral to secure either a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC), or [fixed-rate HELOC](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/fixed-rate-option/), which is a kind of home equity loan and HELOC hybrid.

A [home equity loan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequityloan.asp), sometimes referred to as a [second mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondmortgage.asp), usually allows you to borrow a lump sum against your current home equity for a fixed rate over a fixed period of time. Many home equity loans are used to finance large expenditures, such as home repairs or college tuition.

A [home equity line of credit (HELOC)](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/) is a revolving line of credit usually with an adjustable interest rate, which allows you to borrow up to a certain amount over a period of time. HELOCs work in a manner similar to credit cards, where you can continuously borrow up to an approved limit while paying off the balance.

## Example of Home Equity

If a homeowner purchases a home for $100,000 with a 20% down payment (covering the remaining $80,000 with a mortgage), the owner has equity of $20,000 in the house. If the market value of the house remains constant over the next two years, and $5,000 of mortgage payments are applied to the principal, the owner would possess $25,000 in home equity at the end of the two year period.

If the market value of the home had increased by $100,000 over those two years, and that same $5,000 from mortgage payments were applied to the principal, the owner would then have a home equity of $125,000.
