## What Is the Russell 3000 Index?

The Russell 3000 Index is a [market-capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp)\-weighted equity index maintained by [FTSE](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ftse.asp) Russell that provides exposure to the entire U.S. [stock market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp). The index tracks the performance of the 3,000 largest U.S.-traded stocks which represent about 98% of all U.S incorporated equity securities.1  

### Key Takeaways

-   The Russell 3000 Index is a market-capitalization-weighted equity index.
-   The index tracks the performance of the 3,000 largest U.S.-traded stocks, which collectively account for roughly 98% of all U.S incorporated equities.1
-   The Russell 3000 Index serves as the basis for a broad range of market indexes, such as the large-cap Russell 1000 and the small-cap Russell 2000 index.23
-   Large-cap stocks direct a majority of the index's performance, while the returns of other segments are overlooked.

## Understanding the Russell 3000 Index

The Russell 3000 Index serves as a building block for a broad range of financial products which include the large-cap Russell 1000 and the small-cap Russell 2000 index. The largest 1,000 stocks indexed in the Russell 3000 constitute the Russell 1000, while the Russell 2000 is a subset of the smallest 2000 components.2 3 Unlike other funds, the Russell 3000 does not attempt to outperform a benchmark or take a defensive position when the markets appear [overvalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overvalued.asp). Instead, it employs a fully passive strategy.

### Important

In March of 2020, FTSE Russell announced the 2020 schedule for the annual reconstitution, or rebalancing, of its Russell US Indexes. On June 15, 2020, the “lock-down” period began, when US index adds & delete lists are considered final. On June 26, the Russell Reconstitution becomes final after the close of the US equity markets. On June 29, equity markets open with the newly-reconstituted Russell US Indexes. The rebalance is expected to drive a record tilt towards larger companies over small, growth companies over value, and tech/healthcare over the other sectors.4

Stocks in the Russell 3000 index are reconstituted once a year on the last Friday in June. At this time, all eligible securities are ranked by their current market capitalization. This ensures growing or shrinking companies are accurately represented in the overall index. At any time, if a particular security is no longer eligible for membership then a replacement is named at the next scheduled reconstitution. Thus, the number of securities in the index will fluctuate according to corporate actions such as mergers, acquisitions or going private.5 

A significant portion of the underlying index is represented by securities in the financial, consumer discretionary, health care and technology sectors. The technology sector's weighting in the index has steadily increased over the past decade as many companies have adapted to an increasingly tech-focused economy. Sure enough, the biggest holdings comprise of tech giants such as Microsoft ([MSFT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=MSFT)), Facebook ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=fb)), and Google ([GOOGL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=googl)). As of July 2020, the average market capitalization of stocks in the index stands at $367 billion.6

## Limitations of the Russell 3000 Index

Many investors often make the mistake of buying the Russell 3000 as a way of securing a diversified mix of [large-cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp), [mid-cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/midcapstock.asp) and [small-cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp) stocks. However, the truth is that large-cap stocks direct a majority of the index's performance while the returns of other segments are overlooked. As a result, the performance of the Russell 3000 often exhibits a high correlation with the S&P 500 and does not effectively capture the total stock market.7 A more effective way of building a diversified portfolio is to invest in multiple funds across various categories such as domestic stocks, foreign securities, and income instruments.
