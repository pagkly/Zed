Depression Definition
## What Is a Depression?

A depression is a severe and prolonged downturn in [economic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-conditions.asp) activity. In [economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economics.asp), a depression is commonly defined as an extreme [recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp) that lasts three or more years or which leads to a decline in real [gross domestic product (GDP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) of at least 10%. in a given year. Depressions are relatively less frequent than milder recessions, and tend to be accompanied by high unemployment and low inflation.1

### Key Takeaways

-   A depression is characterized as a dramatic downturn in economic activity in conjunction with a sharp fall in growth, employment, and production.
-   Depressions are often identified as recessions lasting longer than three years or resulting in a drop in annual GDP of at least 10%.1
-   The U.S. economy has experienced several recessions but just a handful of major economic depressions.

## Understanding Depressions

In times of depression, [consumer confidence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cci.asp) and investments decrease, causing the economy to shut down. Economic factors that characterize a depression include:

-   Substantial increases in [unemployment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp)
-   A drop in available [credit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp)
-   Diminishing output and productivity
-   Consistent negative GDP growth
-   [Bankruptcies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp)
-   [Sovereign debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-debt.asp) defaults
-   Reduced [trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade.asp) and global commerce
-   [Bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) in stocks
-   Sustained asset price [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) and falling [currency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp) values
-   Low to no inflation, or even [deflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp)
-   Increased savings rate (among those who can save)

[Economists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp) disagree on the duration of depressions. Some believe a depression encompasses only the period plagued by declining economic activity. Other economists argue that the depression continues up until the point that most economic activity has returned to normal.

## Depression vs. Recession

A recession is a normal part of the [business cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp) that generally occurs when GDP contracts for at least two [quarters](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quarter.asp). A depression, on the other hand, is an extreme fall in economic activity that lasts for years, rather than just several quarters. This makes recessions much more common: since 1854, there have been 33 recessions in the U.S. and just one depression.2 Moreover, a recession is marked by economists as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, even if those periods of contraction are relatively mild. A depression, on the other hand, is marked by a drop in a year's GDP over 10% or more.

### Important

Depressions and recessions differ both in duration and the severity of economic contraction.

## Example of a Depression 

The [Great Depression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp) lasted roughly a decade and is widely considered to be the worst economic downturn in the history of the [industrialized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrialization.asp) world. It began shortly after the Oct. 24, 1929, U.S. [stock market crash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash.asp) known as [Black Thursday](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackthursday.asp). After years of reckless investing and [speculation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp) the stock market [bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp) burst and a huge [sell-off](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sell-off.asp) began, with a record 12.9 million [shares traded](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volumeoftrade.asp).

The United States was already in a recession, and the following Tuesday, on Oct. 29, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12% in another mass sell-off, triggering the start of the Great Depression.3

Although the Great Depression began in the United States, the economic impact was felt worldwide for more than a decade. The Great Depression was characterized by a drop in [consumer spending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp) and investment, and by catastrophic unemployment, poverty, hunger, and political unrest. In the U.S., unemployment climbed to nearly 25% in 1933, remaining in the double-digits until 1941, when it finally receded to 9.66%.4

During the Great Depression, unemployment rose to 24.9%, wages slid 42%, real estate prices declined 25%, total U.S. economic output fell by 30%, and many [investors' portfolios became completely worthless](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/lose-money-stock-market-crashes/) when stock prices dropped to 10% of their previous highs.56784

Shortly after Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president in 1932, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp) was created to protect depositors' accounts.9 In addition, the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) was formed to regulate the U.S. stock markets. 

### Why a Repeat of the Great Depression Is Unlikely

Policymakers appear to have learned their lesson from the Great Depression. New laws and regulations were introduced to prevent a repeat and [central banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) were forced to rethink how best to go about tackling economic stagnation.

Nowadays, central banks are quicker to react to [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) and are more willing to use [expansionary monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expansionary_policy.asp) to lift the economy during difficult times. Using these tools helped to stop the [great recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp) of the late 2000s from becoming a full-blown depression.

## What Triggers a Depression?

A series of factors can cause an economy and production to contract severely. In the case of the Great Depression, questionable [monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) took the blame.

After the stock market crashed in 1929, the [Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/federal-reserve.asp) (Fed) continued to hike [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp)—defending the [gold standard](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp) took priority over pumping money into the economy to encourage spending.**10** Those actions triggered massive [deflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp). Prices declined by about 10% each year and consumers, mindful that the prices for goods and services would continue to fall, refrained from making purchases.11
