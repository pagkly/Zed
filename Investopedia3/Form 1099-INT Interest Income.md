## Who Must File Form 1099-INT: Interest Income?

Brokerage firms, banks, [[mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp), and other financial institutions are required to file a 1099-INT on any interest over $10 paid during the year. The form must be reported to the IRS and sent to each interest recipient by Jan. 31st.2

When taxpayers borrow money, the lenders charge them interest on the loans. This interest represents a cost of borrowing to the borrower, who can be an individual, a business, or a government agency. Individuals and businesses can borrow money by taking out loans from a bank. Likewise, businesses and federal and municipal governments can borrow money by issuing bonds to investors.

Financial institutions pay interest to account holders as compensation for the bank's use of the deposited funds. The interest received by the investors or lenders is [[taxable income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp) and must be reported to the IRS.

Form 1099-INT recipients may not have to pay income tax on the interest a payer reports, but may still need to report it on their return. The IRS uses the information on the form to ensure the interest earner reports the correct amount of interest income on their tax return.

IRS Form 1099-INT must be filed for each person:

2.  For whom a financial institution withheld and paid any foreign tax on interest.
3.  From whom a financial institution withheld (and did not refund) any federal income tax under the backup withholding rules regardless of the amount of the payment.1

## Other Relevant Forms

The amounts and types of interest will impact which tax form is to be used. Taxpayers who receive over $1,500 of taxable interest must list all of their payers on Part 1 of [[Schedule B]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081414/who-needs-fill-out-irs-form-schedule-b.asp) on [[Form 1040]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp).4 Form 1099-INT will always report interest paid as [[cash-basis income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/cashbasistaxpayer.asp); this means that income that is owed but not yet paid cannot be reported on this form.1
