Gross Processing Margin (GPM)
## What Is Gross Processing Margin (GPM)?

The gross processing margin (GPM) is the difference between the cost of a raw commodity and the income it generates once sold as a finished product. The gross processing margin is affected by supply and demand. The prices for raw commodities fluctuate, creating an ever-changing [[spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp) between the raw inputs and the processed products.

Investors, traders, and speculators are able to trade [[futures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp) based on the price difference between a raw commodity and the final product it produces. For example, a trader can go long on the commodity and short on the finished product of it.

### Key Takeaways

-   The gross processing margin (GPM) is the difference between the cost of a raw commodity and the income generated once the commodity has been sold as a finished product.
-   A good example of GPM is the cost of oil compared to the income earned from selling gasoline.
-   GPM is used by traders to take advantage of price discrepancies between the raw form of a commodity and the finished good.
-   Each commodity has its own terminology for GPM; e.g. crack spread, crush spread, and spark spread.

## Understanding Gross Processing MarginÂ (GPM)

The gross processing margin can go from generous to thin on a seasonal basis, as well as from unexpected weather events or regional turmoil in an area that is a significant producer of a commodity. When the spread for the gross processing margin widens, meaning that the pricing of the outputs is exceeding the cost of the inputs, that is generally seen as a signal for production capacity expansion.

The gross processing margin usually increases for one of two reasons. One, the input commodity sees a glut, possibly due to overproduction or simply luck, and therefore the price weakens significantly. Two, the price for the processed products rises due to increasing demand. For the health of the whole value chain, investors generally want to see the GPM increasing for the latter reason as it represents more sustainable industry growth.

## Gross Processing Margin (GPM) and the Type of Processor

The gross processing margin for two businesses using the same raw commodity can be very different depending on the end product mix. This applies to everything from soybeans to crude, but it is easiest to understand in terms of livestock and meat. Two pork processors are working with the same raw commodity, but if one simply sells whole cuts frozen and the other sells a range of [[value-added]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueadded.asp) products including bacon, sausages, and marinated loins, then their gross processing margins will likely reflect that product variance.

The frozen [[wholesaler]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wholesaling.asp) has lower costs of production but similar procurement costs. The value-add focused processor puts more cost and time into the meat but should see a much higher premium upon sale.

## Commodity Specific Names for Gross Processing Margin (GPM)

The gross processing margin may go by a different name depending on the commodity it is describing. For example, the GPM for oil is called the [[crack spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crackspread.asp) in a reference to the refining process of cracking hydrocarbons into petroleum products. For soybeans and canola, it's called the [[crush spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crushspread.asp) because soybeans are crushed to produce oil and meal.
