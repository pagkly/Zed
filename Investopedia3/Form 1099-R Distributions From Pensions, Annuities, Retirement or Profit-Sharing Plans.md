A 1099-R form is one of many forms in the 1099 series. All of these forms are known as information returns and [[are used to report]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082514/purpose-1099-forms.asp) various types of income—other than their salary—that a person may receive, such as independent contractor income, interest and [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp), or government payments.2
