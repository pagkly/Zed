Z
## What Is Z?

The term Z refers to a designation for [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp)\-listed securities that identifies a miscellaneous entity. This extension is just one of the fifth-letter identifiers that appear after a company's ticker symbol. It indicates that the stock is different from single issues of common or capital stock. The reasons for a Z-designation tend to vary and may include things like [[depositary receipts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) or units. The reasons for a Z designation aren't always obvious and usually require a little research.

### Key Takeaways

-   Z is a fifth-letter identifier for Nasdaq stock symbols.
-   It indicates that a stock is different from a single issue of common or capital stock.
-   Z might indicate that the issue is a depositary receipt, stub, additional warrant, or unit.

## Understanding Z

Companies must choose a unique [[ticker symbol]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tickersymbol.asp) when they want to list on a [[stock exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/092404.asp). This symbol is made up of a series of characters that identifies the company's stock. It allows traders to execute [[transactions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction.asp) for these securities. The ticker symbol also identifies the stock exchange on which a particular security trades. For instance, a ticker with three letters trades on the [[New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE), while those with four letters trade on the Nasdaq.

These ticker symbols may come with suffixes that alert [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) to specific situations about the stock itself. Suffixes for Nasdaq-listed securities appear as fifth-letter identifiers and follow a dot after their ticker symbols.1 When a fifth letter appears, it identifies the issue as different from a single issue of common stock or capital stock.

The Z-letter suffix identifies a variety of miscellaneous entities.1 Unlike other designations, this one can be fairly vague, so it's up to individuals investors and traders to do their [[due diligence]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp). Doing a little research can help them figure out why the suffix is added to the end of the security's ticker symbol.

As mentioned above, the letter Z identifies securities that are not single issues of [[common]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp) or [[capital stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstock.asp). It may indicate that the security is a depositary receipt, stub, additional warrant, or another type of unit. Z historically had a different meaning in futures [[trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp), though, where it indicated a delivery month of December until new options symbology was introduced in 2010.

The NYSE uses fourth-letter identifiers to distinguish unique instances when certain issuances vary from normal conditions.

## Z vs. Other Letter Designations

The Nasdaq uses a variety of letters or fifth-letter designations to distinguish stock issuances and the rights that come along with them. Z is just one of those designations. Like Z, the letter L also identifies miscellaneous entities. This identifier denotes [[certificates of participation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofparticipation.asp) (COPs), preferred participation, and stubs.

If you see a ticker symbol with the letter P after a dot, it means that the issuance is the preferred first issue of a company, while the letter O is the second preferred issue. The letter E means the company is delinquent with a [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) filing, while K denotes a series of non-voting stock. The letter F means that the stock is a foreign issue.
