# Forward Price-To-Earnings (Forward P/E) Definition

> ## Excerpt
> Forward price-to-earnings (forward P/E) is a measure of the P/E ratio using forecasted earnings for the P/E calculation. While the earnings used in this formula are an estimate and are not as reliable as current or historical earnings data, there is still a benefit to estimated P/E analysis.

Inside Forward Price-To-Earnings (Forward P/E Metric)
## What Is Forward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E)?

Forward price-to-earnings (forward P/E) is a version of the ratio of [price-to-earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) (P/E) that uses forecasted earnings for the P/E calculation. While the earnings used in this formula are just an estimate and not as reliable as current or historical earnings data, there is still benefit in estimated P/E analysis.

### Key Takeaways:

-   Forward P/E is a version of the ratio of price-to-earnings that uses forecasted earnings for the P/E calculation.
-   Because forward P/E uses estimated earnings per share (EPS), it may produce incorrect or biased results if actual earnings prove to be different.
-   Analysts often combine forward and trailing P/E estimates to make a better judgment.

#### Forward Price-to-Earnings

## Understanding Forward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E)

The forecasted earnings used in the formula below are typically either projected earnings for the following 12 months or the next full-year fiscal (FY) period. [The forward P/E can be contrasted with the trailing P/E ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050115/what-difference-between-forward-pe-and-trailing-pe.asp).

Forward P/E\=Current Share PriceEstimated Future Earnings per Share\\text{Forward } P/E = \\frac{\\text{Current Share Price}}{\\text{Estimated Future Earnings per Share}}

For example, assume that a company has a current share price of $50 and this year’s earnings per share are $5. Analysts estimate that the company's earnings will grow by 10% over the next fiscal year. The company has a current P/E ratio of $50 / 5 = 10x.

The forward P/E, on the other hand, would be $50 / (5 x 1.10) = 9.1x. Note that the forward P/E is smaller than the current P/E since the forward P/E accounts for future earnings growth relative to today's share price.

## What Does Forward Price-to-Earnings Reveal?

Analysts like to think of the P/E ratio as a price tag on earnings. It is used to calculate a [relative value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relative-value.asp) based on a company's level of earnings. In theory, $1 of earnings at company A is worth the same as $1 of earnings at company B. If this is the case, both companies should also be trading at the same price, but this is rarely the case.

If company A is trading for $5, and company B is trading for $10, this implies that the market values company B's earnings more. There can be various interpretations as to why company B is valued more. It could mean that company B's earnings are overvalued. It could also mean that company B deserves a premium on the value of its earnings due to superior management and a better [business model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp).

When calculating the [trailing P/E ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingpe.asp), analysts compare today's price against earnings for the last 12 months, or the last [fiscal year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp). However, both are based on [historical prices](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/03/103103.asp). Analysts use earnings estimates to determine what the relative value of the company will be at a future level of earnings. The forward P/E estimates the relative value of the earnings.

For example, if the [current price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp) of company B is $10, and earnings are estimated to double next year to $2, the forward P/E ratio is 5x, or half the value of the company when it made $1 in earnings. If the forward P/E ratio is lower than the current P/E ratio, this implies that analysts are expecting earnings to increase. If the forward P/E is higher than the current P/E ratio, analysts expect a decrease in earnings.

## Forward P/E vs. Trailing P/E

Forward P/E uses projected EPS. Meanwhile, trailing P/E relies on past performance by dividing the [current share price](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/how-companys-share-price-determined.asp) by the total EPS earnings over the past 12 months. Trailing P/E is the most popular P/E metric because it's the most objective—assuming the company reported earnings accurately. Some investors prefer to look at the trailing P/E because they don't trust another individual’s earnings estimates.

However, trailing P/E also has its share of shortcomings—namely, a company’s past performance does not signal future behavior. Investors should thus commit money based on future [earnings power](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-power.asp), not the past. The fact that the EPS number remains constant while the stock prices fluctuate is also a problem. If a major company event drives the stock price significantly higher or lower, the trailing P/E will be less reflective of those changes.

## Limitations of Forward P/E

Since forward P/E relies on estimated future earnings, it is subject to miscalculation and/or analysts' bias. There are other inherent problems with the forward P/E also. Companies could underestimate earnings to beat the consensus estimate P/E when the next quarter's earnings are announced.

Other companies may overstate the estimate and later adjust it going into their next [earnings announcement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-announcement.asp). Furthermore, external analysts may also provide estimates, which may diverge from the company estimates, creating confusion.

If you're using forward P/E as the central basis of your [investment thesis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-thesis.asp), research the companies thoroughly. If the company updates its guidance, this will affect the forward P/E in a way that might cause you to change your opinion. It is good practice to use both forward and trailing P/E to come to a more trustworthy figure.

## How to Calculate Forward P/E in Excel

You can calculate a company's forward P/E for the next fiscal year in Microsoft Excel. As shown above, the formula for the forward P/E is simply a company's market price per share divided by its expected earnings per share. In Microsoft Excel, first increase the widths of columns A, B, and C by right-clicking on each of the columns and left-clicking on "Column Width" and change the value to 30.

Assume you wanted to compare the forward P/E ratio between two companies in the same sector. Enter the name of the first company into cell B1 and the name of the second company into cell C1. Then:

-   Enter "Market Price per Share" into cell A2, and the corresponding values for the companies' market price per share into cells B2 and C2.
-   Next, enter "[Forward Earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fowardlookingearnings.asp) per Share" into cell A3, and the corresponding value for the companies' expected EPS for the next fiscal year into cells B3 and C3.
-   Then, enter "Forward Price to Earnings Ratio" into cell A4.

For example, assume company ABC is currently trading at $50 and has an expected EPS of $2.60. Enter "Company ABC" into cell B1. Next, enter "=50" into cell B2 and "=2.6" into cell B3. Then, enter "=B2/B3" into cell B4. The resulting forward P/E ratio for company ABC is 19.23.

On the other hand, company DEF currently has a [market value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp) per share of $30 and has an expected EPS of $1.80. Enter "Company DEF" into cell C1. Next, enter "=30" into cell C2 and "=1.80" into cell C3. Then, enter "=C2/C3" into cell C4. The resulting forward P/E for company DEF is 16.67.

Since company ABC has a higher forward P/E ratio than company DEF, this indicates that investors expect higher earnings in the future from company ABC than company DEF.
