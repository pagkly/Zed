## What Is Form 1065: U.S. Return of Partnership Income?

Form 1065: U.S. Return of Partnership Income is a tax document issued by the [[Internal Revenue Service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) used to declare the profits, losses, deductions, and credits of a business partnership.1 In addition to Form 1065, partnerships must also submit [[Schedule K-1]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule-k-1.asp), a document prepared for each partner.2

Form 1065 gives the IRS a snapshot of the company's financial status for the year. The partners must report and pay taxes on their shares of income from the partnership on their tax returns. Partners must pay income tax on their earnings regardless of whether the earnings were distributed.3

### Key Takeaways
