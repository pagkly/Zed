[[Land Contract]]
## What Is a [[Land Contract]]?

A [[Land Contract|land contract]] is an agreement between a buyer and [[seller]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp) pertaining to a specific tract of land. Developers advertise and sell tracts of land similar to the process of selling a real [[Estate|estate]] property. Land contracts can be broad in [[Scope|scope]] and may include both the land and real estate on the land. Many land contracts involve seller-financed purchases. Some borrowers buying land may also choose to [[Finance|finance]] the purchase through a bank [[Loan|loan]].

## [[Land Contract]] Explained

A [[Land Contract|land contract]] details the specific terms associated with buying a piece of property. Land contracts can be broad in [[Scope|scope]] with certain states having more generous legal rights for land [[contract holders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractholder.asp) than others. As a result, the world of land contracts can be difficult to navigate. As such, a buyer of land must be very careful to ensure that the terms of the contract are legally binding in case a dispute arises in the future.

## [[Seller Financing]]

Land contracts are often structured with [[Seller Financing|seller financing]]. This can provide for a broader universe of eligible borrowers since seller financing can sometimes allow for purchasers that would not otherwise qualify for a mortgage, or for investors who wish to complete a purchase faster than a regular [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) would allow.

[[Seller Financing|Seller financing]] reduces the number of entities involved in selling a property. Seller financing allows the buyer to purchase the property directly from the seller over a period of time rather than paying one up-front payment. In a seller-financing deal the seller determines the interest rate required, duration of the deal, and any [[down payment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down_payment.asp) required.

Seller financed land contracts may include a tract of land or they may also include land and any assets located on the land. Assets included in a [[Land Contract|land contract]] may include residential homes, pools, tennis courts, basketball courts, barns, or horse tracks. Any assets located on the land and included in a land contract [[Will|will]] affect the price. The seller holds the title on all assets until full payment is made, at which time the title is transferred.

## Bank Financing

Land contracts are often seller-financed. However, in some cases, a borrower may seek traditional bank financing for a [[Land Contract|land contract]]. A borrower seeking to build on a piece of land may wish to [[Finance|finance]] the property through a bank [[Loan|loan]]. Terms of a loan for land [[Will|will]] generally include a higher [[interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) and are usually based on a shorter term. Loans for land will also often be structured with a balloon payment rather than regular installment payments. Often builders receiving a loan for land will refinance or pay off the loan with a takeout loan once the real [[Estate|estate]] is built and greater [[Collateral|collateral]] value is established.
