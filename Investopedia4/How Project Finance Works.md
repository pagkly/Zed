[[How Project Finance Works]]
## What Is Project [[Finance]]?

Project [[Finance|finance]] is the funding (financing) of long-term infrastructure, industrial projects, and public services using a non-recourse or limited recourse [[financial structure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-structure.asp). The [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] used to finance the project are paid back from the [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] generated by the project.

Project financing is a [[Loan|loan]] structure that relies primarily on the project's [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] for repayment, with the project's assets, rights, and interests held as secondary [[Collateral|collateral]]. Project [[Finance|finance]] is especially attractive to the private sector because companies can fund major projects [[off-balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/off-balance-sheet-obs.asp).

Not all infrastructure investments are funded with project [[Finance|finance]]. Many companies issue traditional [[Debt|debt]] or [[Equity|equity]] in order to undertake such projects.

## Understanding Project [[Finance]]

The project [[Finance|finance]] structure for a build, operate and transfer (BOT) project includes multiple key elements.

Project [[Finance|finance]] for BOT projects generally includes a [special purpose vehicle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spv.asp) (SPV). The company’s sole activity is carrying out the project by subcontracting most aspects through construction and operations contracts. Because there is no revenue stream during the construction phase of new-build projects, [[Debt Service|debt service]] only occurs during the operations phase.

For this reason, parties take significant risks during the construction phase. The sole revenue stream during this phase is generally under an [[offtake]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offtake-agreement.asp) agreement or power purchase agreement. Because there is limited or no recourse to the project’s sponsors, company shareholders are typically liable up to the extent of their shareholdings. The project remains off-balance-sheet for the sponsors and for the government.

### Off-Balance Sheet

Project [[Debt|debt]] is typically held in a sufficient minority subsidiary not consolidated on the balance sheet of the respective shareholders. This reduces the project’s impact on the cost of the shareholders’ existing debt and debt capacity. The shareholders are free to use their debt capacity for other investments.

To some extent, the government may use project financing to keep project [[Debt|debt]] and liabilities off-balance-sheet so they take up less fiscal space. Fiscal space is the amount of money the government may spend beyond what it is already investing in public services such as health, welfare, and education. The theory is that strong economic growth [[Will|will]] bring the government more money through extra tax revenue from more people working and paying more taxes, allowing the government to increase spending on public services.

### Key Takeaways

-   Project [[Finance|finance]] is the funding (financing) of long-term infrastructure, industrial projects, and public services using a non-recourse or limited recourse [[Financial Structure|financial structure]].
-   A [[Debtor|debtor]] with a non-recourse [[Loan|loan]] cannot be pursued for any additional payment beyond the seizure of the asset.
-   Project [[Debt|debt]] is typically held in a sufficient minority subsidiary not consolidated on the balance sheet of the respective shareholders (i.e., it is an off-balance sheet item.)

### Non-Recourse Financing

When defaulting on a [[Loan|loan]], recourse financing gives lenders full claim to shareholders’ assets or [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]. In contrast, project financing provides the project company as a limited-[[Liability|liability]] SPV. The lenders’ recourse is thus limited primarily or entirely to the project’s assets, including completion and performance guarantees and bonds, in case the project company defaults.

A key issue in non-recourse financing is whether circumstances may arise in which the lenders have recourse to some or all of the shareholders’ assets. A deliberate breach on the part of the shareholders may give the [[Lender|lender]] recourse to assets.

Applicable law may restrict the extent to which shareholder [[Liability|liability]] may be limited. For example, liability for personal injury or death is typically not subject to elimination. Non-recourse [[Debt|debt]] is characterized by high [capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp), long [[Loan|loan]] periods and uncertain revenue streams. Underwriting these loans requires financial modeling skills and a sound knowledge of the [[Underlying|underlying]] technical domain.

To preempt deficiency balances, [[Loan|loan]]-to-value (LTV) ratios are usually limited to 60% in [[non-recourse loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonrecoursedebt.asp). Lenders impose higher credit standards on borrowers to minimize the chance of [[Default|default]]. Non-recourse loans, on account of their greater [[Risk|risk]], carry higher interest rates than recourse loans.

### Recourse Versus Non-Recourse Loans

If two people are looking to purchase large assets, such as a home, and one receives a recourse [[Loan|loan]] and the other a non-recourse loan, the actions the financial institution can take against each borrower are different.

In both cases, the homes may be used as [[Collateral|collateral]], meaning they can be seized should either borrower [[Default|default]]. To recoup costs when the borrowers default, the financial institutions can attempt to sell the homes and use the sale price to pay down the associated [[Debt|debt]]. If the properties sell for less than the amount owed, the financial institution can pursue only the [[Debtor|debtor]] with the recourse [[Loan|loan]]. The debtor with the non-recourse loan cannot be pursued for any additional payment beyond the seizure of the asset.
