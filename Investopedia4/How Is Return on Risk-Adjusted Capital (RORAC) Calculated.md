[[How Is Return on Risk-Adjusted Capital (RORAC) Calculated]]?
## What Is [[Return]] on [[Risk]]-Adjusted Capital (RORAC)?

The [[Return|return]] on [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted capital (RORAC) is a rate of return measure commonly used in financial analysis, where various projects, endeavors, and investments are evaluated based on [[capital at risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-risk-car.asp). Projects with different [[risk profiles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-profile.asp) are easier to compare with each other once their individual RORAC values have been calculated.

The RORAC is similar to [[return on equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) (ROE), except the denominator is adjusted to account for the [[Risk|risk]] of a project.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Return]] on [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted capital (RORAC) is commonly used in financial analysis, where various projects or investments are evaluated based on capital at risk.
-   RORAC allows for an apples-to-apples comparison of projects with different [[Risk|risk]] profiles.
-   Similar to [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted [[Return|return]] on capital, RAROC differs in that it adjusts the return for risk and not the capital.

## The Formula for RORAC Is

[[Return]] on [[Risk]]-Adjusted Capital is calculated by dividing a company’s net income by the risk-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets.

## What Does [[Return]] on [[Risk]]-Adjusted Capital Tell You?

[[Return]] on [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted capital (RORAC) takes into account the capital at risk, whether it be related to a project or company division. Allocated risk capital is the firm's capital, adjusted for a maximum potential loss based on estimated future earnings distributions or the [[Volatility|volatility]] of earnings.

Companies use RORAC to place greater emphasis on firm-wide [[Risk|risk]] management. For example, different corporate divisions with unique managers can use RORAC to quantify and maintain acceptable risk-exposure levels.

This calculation is similar to [[risk-adjusted return on capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/raroc.asp) (RAROC). With RORAC, however, the capital is adjusted for [[Risk|risk]], not the rate of [[Return|return]]. RORAC is used when the risk varies depending on the capital asset being analyzed.

## Example of How to Use RORAC

Assume a firm is evaluating two projects it has engaged in over the previous year and needs to decide which one to eliminate. Project A had [[total revenues]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp) of $100,000 and total expenses of $50,000. The total [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets involved in the project is $400,000.

Project B had total revenues of $200,000 and total expenses of $100,000. The total [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets involved in Project B is $900,000. The RORAC of the two projects is calculated as:

Project A RORAC\=$100,000−$50,000$400,000\=12.5%Project B RORAC\=$200,000−$100,000$900,000\=11.1%\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Project A RORAC}=\\frac{\\$100,000-\\$50,000}{\\$400,000}=12.5\\%\\\\ &\\text{Project B RORAC}=\\frac{\\$200,000-\\$100,000}{\\$900,000}=11.1\\%\\\\ \\end{aligned}

Even though Project B had twice as much revenue as Project A, once the [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] capital of each project is taken into account, it is clear that Project A has a better RORAC.

## The Difference Between RORAC and RAROC

RORAC is similar to, and easily confused with, two other statistics. [[Risk]]-adjusted [[Return|return]] on capital (RAROC) is usually defined as the ratio of [[risk-adjusted return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskadjustedreturn.asp) to [[economic capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-capital.asp). In this calculation, instead of adjusting the risk of the capital itself, it is the risk of the return that is quantified and measured. Often, the expected return of a project is divided by [[value at risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp) (VaR) to arrive at RAROC.

Another statistic similar to RORAC is the [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted [[Return|return]] on risk-adjusted capital (RARORAC). This statistic is calculated by taking the [[risk-adjusted return and dividing it by economic capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/08/economic-capital.asp), adjusting for [[Diversification|diversification]] benefits. It uses guidelines defined by the international risk standards covered in [[Basel III]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basell-iii.asp)—which is a set for reforms that are to be implemented by Jan. 1, 2022, and is meant to improve the regulation, supervision, and risk management within the banking sector.

## Limitations of Using [[Return]] on [[Risk]]-Adjusted Capital – RORAC

Calculating the [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted capital can be cumbersome as it requires understanding the value at risk calculation.
