[[A Definition and Explanation of Free On Board (FOB)]]
## What Is Free On Board (FOB)?

Free On Board (FOB) is a shipment term used to indicate whether the seller or the buyer is liable for goods that are damaged or destroyed during shipping. "FOB shipping point" or "FOB origin" means the buyer is at [[Risk|risk]] and takes [[ownership of goods]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/younginvestors/10/what-is-an-investment.asp) once the seller ships the product. Historically, FOB was used only to refer to goods transported by ship; in the United States, the term has since been expanded to include all types of transportation.

For accounting purposes, the supplier should record a sale at the point of departure from its shipping dock. "FOB origin" means the purchaser pays the shipping cost from the factory or warehouse and gains ownership of the goods as soon as it leaves its point of origin. "FOB destination" means the [[seller]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp) retains the [[Risk|risk]] of loss until the goods reach the buyer.

## Understanding Free On Board (FOB)

Contracts involving international transportation often contain abbreviated trade terms that describe matters such as the time and place of delivery, payment, when the [[Risk|risk]] of loss shifts from the seller to the buyer, and who pays the costs of freight and insurance.

The most common international trade terms are [[Incoterms]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incoterms.asp), which the International Chamber of [[Commerce]] (ICC) publishes, but firms that ship goods within the United States must also adhere to the [[Uniform Commercial Code]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uniform-commercial-code.asp) (UCC). Since there is more than one set of rules, and legal definitions of FOB may differ from one country to another, the parties to a contract must indicate which governing laws are being used for a shipment.

One of the most important aspects of FOB is that it establishes when ownership of the freight is transferred from the seller to the buyer. It is essential for any vendor-client transaction to make clear FOB terms in the purchase order as these terms determine which party [[Will|will]] pay for shipping and insurance costs.

If the terms include the phrase "FOB destination, freight collect," the seller has title and control over the shipment until it's been delivered, and the buyer is responsible for freight charges. If the terms include "FOB destination, freight prepaid," the seller retains ownership until delivery, provided there are no insurance claims. In this scenario, the seller is responsible for the freight charges. On the other hand, "FOB origin" or "FOB shipping point" indicates the opposite—that the buyer takes ownership as soon as the vendor ships the goods.

### Key Takeaways

-   Free On Board is a term used to indicate who is liable for goods damaged or destroyed during shipping.
-   "FOB origin" means the buyer is at [[Risk|risk]] and takes ownership of goods once the seller ships the product.
-   "FOB destination" means the seller retains the [[Risk|risk]] of loss until the goods reach the buyer.
-   The terms of FOB affect the buyer's inventory cost; adding [[Liability|liability]] for shipped goods increases inventory costs and reduces net income.
-   Legal definitions of FOB may differ between individual countries.

## Example of Free On Board (FOB)

Assume, for example, that Acme Clothing manufactures jeans and sells them to retailers such as Old Navy. If Acme ships $100,000 in jeans from their factory in Los Angeles to an Old Navy store in New York City using the term FOB shipping point (FOB Los Angeles), Old Navy is liable for any loss while the goods are in transit and would purchase insurance to protect the shipment. On the other hand, [[if the goods are shipped FOB destination]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052515/what-distinction-between-free-board-fob-shipping-point-and-destination.asp) (FOB New York) Acme Clothing retains the [[Risk|risk]] until the freight reaches Old Navy's offices and would insure the shipment against loss.

## Factoring in Inventory Costs

Shipping terms affect the buyer's inventory cost because inventory costs include all costs to prepare the inventory for sale. Using the same example, if the jeans were shipped using FOB shipping point terms, Old Navy’s inventory cost would have to include the $100,000 [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] and the cost of insuring the goods against loss during shipment.

Similarly, when Old Navy incurs other costs related to inventory, such as renting a warehouse, paying for utilities, and securing the warehouse, those costs are also added to inventory. This accounting treatment is important because adding costs to inventory means the buyer does not immediately expense the costs and this delay in recognizing the cost as an expense affects net income.

Another reason companies should be acutely aware of free on board (FOB) terms is that FOB establishes when the goods become an [[asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) on the buyer's [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp). This becomes especially important if a transaction occurs close to the transition from one accounting period to the next, such as the end of a calendar or [[fiscal year]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp). Accountants need to know whether to include the freight on the company's balance sheet when the goods are shipped or when they are delivered.

## Examples of Inventory Cost Management

Depending on the FOB terms, the more often a company orders inventory, the more shipping and insurance costs it [[Will|will]] incur. Companies can also incur costs when placing an inventory order through the price of hiring labor to unload the goods as well as the cost of leasing a warehouse to store the goods. A company can lower its inventory costs by ordering greater quantities and reducing the number of individual shipments it brings in.

## Problems with FOB

A 2018 study by Ki-Moon Han of the Korea Research Society for Customs looks at the complexities of FOB contracts and explains that they are often misunderstood. According to Han, more sophisticated contracts are increasingly used to meet the needs of international traders. The author states that there is often confusion because the parties involved in the contracts misunderstand incoterms FOB, sales contracts, carriage contracts, and [[letters of credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofcredit.asp). Han urges companies to use caution and to clarify which type of FOB they are entering into so that the risks and liabilities are clear.1

## Free on Board (FOB) FAQs

### What Does FOB Mean?

FOB stands for "free and board" and indicates when [[Liability|liability]] and ownership of goods is transferred from a seller to a buyer.

### What is FOB Pricing?

The costs associated with FOB include transportation of the goods to the port of shipment, loading the goods onto the shipping vessel, freight transport, insurance, and unloading and transporting the goods from the arrival port to the final destination.

### Who Pays Freight on FOB Origin?

If the terms include the phrase "FOB origin, freight collect," the buyer has title and control over the shipment as soon as it's been shipped and is responsible for freight charges. If the terms include "FOB origin, freight prepaid," the buyer of goods assumes the responsibility of goods at the point of origin and the seller pays the cost of shipping.

### What Is the Difference Between FOB and CIF?

CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) and FOB (Free on Board) are two widely used INCOTERM agreements. Although the definition of both terms can differ across countries and is ultimately determined by each individual vendor-client contract, historically, FOB transfers [[Liability|liability]] from seller to buyer when the shipment reaches the port or other facility designated as the point of origin. With a CIF agreement, the seller pays costs and assumes [[Liability|liability]] until the goods reach the port of destination chosen by the buyer.

## The Bottom Line

Each party should have a firm understanding of free on board (FOB) in order to ensure a smooth transfer of goods from vendor to client. Regardless of whether that transfer occurs on the domestic or international level, FOB terms can have a big impact on inventory, shipping, and insurance costs.
