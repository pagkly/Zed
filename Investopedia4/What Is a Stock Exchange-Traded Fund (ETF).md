## What Is a [[Stock]] Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)?

A [[Stock|stock]] ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an asset that tracks a particular set of equities, similar to an index. It trades just as a normal stock would on an exchange, but unlike a [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp), prices adjust throughout the day rather than at market close. These ETFs can track [[Stocks|stocks]] in a single industry, such as energy, or an entire index of equities like the [[S&P 500]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp). Other tracking methods include the [[Stochastic Oscillator and the Stochastic Momentum Index]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021315/what-difference-between-stochastic-oscillator-stochastic-[[Momentum|momentum]]-index.asp).

By doing so, investors can [[Gain|gain]] exposure to a basket of equities and limited company-specific [[Risk|risk]] associated with single [[Stocks|stocks]]. This instant [[Diversification|diversification]] comes in a simple, low cost, and tax-efficient tool that can be accessed through most online [[brokerages]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-brokers-for-etfs-4587875).

### Key Takeaways

-   An exchange traded fund (ETF) tracks a particular set of securities like an index; a [[Stock|stock]] ETF tracks a set of [[Stocks|stocks]].
-   ETFs provide investors with immediate [[Diversification|diversification]] within a low cost, easily tradeable vehicle.
-   Research suggests that passive-investment vehicles like ETFs tend to [[Return|return]] more than actively-managed vehicles like [[mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/how-pick-best-mutual-fund/) over the long run.1

#### 4 Reasons To Invest In ETFs

## Understanding [[Stock]] Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)

A [[Stock|stock]] ETF allows an investor to [[Gain|gain]] exposure to a basket of equities in a specific sector or index without having to purchase individual [[Stocks|stocks]]. Owning diversified assets limits some [[Unsystematic Risk|unsystematic risk]] associated with company stocks. The original purpose of investing in an ETF was to meet long-term goals, but today they are traded like any other stock, in that investors can short or buy on margin.

There is also a group of ETFs that bet against the success of an index or sector, meaning the asset performs well when the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset struggles. [[Unlike a mutual fund, a stock ETF]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110314/key-differences-between-etfs-and-mutual-funds.asp) charges minimal management fees and carries low expense ratios. This makes it an ideal tool for investors of any skill level looking to maintain low costs and generate consistent returns. 

### 2,444

The [[number of ETFs]](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/best-etfs-2018-comprehensive-guide/) that are trading in the United States, as of December 2020, giving investors a huge number of potential funds to choose from.2

## Benefits of [[Stock]] ETFs

[[Stock]] ETFs [[Offer|offer]] investors a wealth of benefits so it makes sense that fund inflows have skyrocketed in recent years. In fact, as of Nov. 2020, the U.S. ETF market topped a record $5 trillion in assets.3 The broad advantages cannot go understated. They are an excellent option for investors looking to diversify their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] in a flexible, low cost, and tax-efficient manner. In fact, a growing body of research suggests passive investments like stock ETFs tend to [[Outperform|outperform]] actively managed funds over a long time frame.1

## Different Styles of [[Stock]] ETFs

The more popular [[Stock|stock]] ETFs track benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 or [[Dow 30]]. [[The SPDR S&P 500]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/05/060605.asp) ([SPY](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=spy)), which is maintained by State Street, is consistently the most active asset with an average daily volume exceeding 67 million [[Shares|shares]] in the past three months.4

Other styles of [[Stock|stock]] ETFs adopt a factor-based strategy that accounts for specific attributes like [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]], [[Momentum|momentum]], and value. This subset of assets is a popular strategy known as [[Smart Beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-beta.asp). It attempts to deliver better [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted returns than a conventional market-cap-[[Weighted|weighted]] index. Sector funds are another popular ETF category that tracks the [[Stocks|stocks]] of a specific industry like energy, financials, and technology.
