[[Vomma Definition]]
## What Is Vomma?

Vomma is the rate at which the vega of an option [[Will|will]] react to [[Volatility|volatility]] in the market. Vomma is part of the group of measures, such as [[delta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp), gamma, and vega, known as the "Greeks" which are used in options pricing.

### Key Takeaways

-   Vomma is the rate at which the vega of an option [[Will|will]] react to [[Volatility|volatility]] in the market.
-   Vomma is a second-order [[Derivative|derivative]] for an option’s value and demonstrates the convexity of vega.
-   Vomma is part of the group of measures, such as delta, gamma, and vega, known as the "Greeks" which are used in options pricing.

## Understanding Vomma

Vomma is a second-order [[Derivative|derivative]] for an option’s value and demonstrates the convexity of vega. A positive value for vomma indicates that a percentage point increase in [[Volatility|volatility]] [[Will|will]] result in an increased option value which is demonstrated by vega's [[convexity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp).

Vomma and vega are two factors involved in understanding and identifying profitable option trades. The two work together in providing detail on an option's price and the option price’s sensitivity to market changes. They can influence the sensitivity and interpretation of the [[Black-Scholes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp) pricing model for option pricing.

## Vega

[Vega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vega.asp) helps an investor to understand a [[Derivative|derivative]] option’s sensitivity to [[Volatility|volatility]] occurring from the [[Underlying|underlying]] instrument. Vega provides the amount of expected positive or negative change in an option’s price per 1% change in the volatility of the underlying instrument. A positive vega indicates an increase in the option price and a negative vega indicates a decrease in the option price.

Vega is measured in whole numbers with values usually ranging from -20 to 20. Higher time periods result in a higher vega. Vega values signify multiples representing losses and gains. For example, a vega of 5 on [[Stock]] A at $100 would indicate a loss of $5 for every point decrease in implied [[Volatility|volatility]] and a [[Gain|gain]] of $5 for every point increase.

The formula for calculating vega is below:

ν\=Sϕ(d1)twithϕ(d1)\=e−d1222πandd1\=ln(SK)+(r+σ22)tσtwhere:K\=option strike priceN\=standard normal cumulative distribution functionr\=[[Risk|risk]] free interest rateσ\=[[Volatility|volatility]] of the underlyingS\=price of the underlyingt\=time to option’s expiry\\begin{aligned} &\\nu = S \\phi (d1) \\sqrt{t} \\\\ &\\text{with} \\\\ &\\phi (d1) = \\frac {e ^ { -\\frac{d1 ^ 2}{2} } }{ \\sqrt{2 \\pi} } \\\\ &\\text{and} \\\\ &d1 = \\frac { ln \\bigg ( \\frac {S}{K} \\bigg ) + \\bigg ( r + \\frac {\\sigma ^ 2}{2} \\bigg ) t }{ \\sigma \\sqrt{t} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &K = \\text{option strike price} \\\\ &N = \\text{standard normal cumulative distribution function} \\\\ &r = \\text{risk free interest rate} \\\\ &\\sigma = \\text{volatility of the [[Underlying|underlying]]} \\\\ &S=\\text{price of the underlying} \\\\ &t = \\text{time to option's expiry} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

## Vega and Vomma

Vomma is a second-order Greek [[Derivative|derivative]] which means that its value provides insight on how vega [[Will|will]] change with the [[implied volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp) of the [[Underlying|underlying]] instrument. If a positive vomma is calculated and [[Volatility|volatility]] increases, vega on the option position will increase. If volatility falls, a positive vomma would indicate a decrease in vega. If vomma is negative, the opposite occurs with volatility changes as indicated by vega’s convexity.

Generally, investors with long options should look for a high, positive value for vomma, while investors with short options should look for a negative one.

The formula for calculating vomma is below:

Vomma\=∂ν∂σ\=∂2V∂σ2\\begin{aligned} \\text{Vomma} = \\frac{ \\partial \\nu}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\frac{\\partial ^ 2V}{\\partial\\sigma ^ 2} \\end{aligned}

Vega and vomma are measures that can be used in gauging the sensitivity of the Black-Scholes option pricing model to variables affecting option prices. They are considered along with the Black-Scholes pricing model when making investment decisions.
