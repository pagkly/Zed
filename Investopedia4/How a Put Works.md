[[How a Put Works]]
## What Is a Put?

A put is an options contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to [[sell]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullverticalspread.asp) a certain amount of the [[underlying asset,]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-asset.asp) at a set price within a specific time. The buyer of a put option believes that the underlying [[Stock|stock]] [[Will|will]] drop below the [[exercise price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp) before the expiration date. The [[Exercise Price|exercise price]] is the price that the underlying asset must reach for the put option contract to [[Hold|hold]] value.

A put can be contrasted with a [call option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), which gives the holder to buy the [[Underlying|underlying]] at a specified price on or before expiration.

### Key Takeaways

-   A put gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] at a set price within a specified time.
-   A put option's value goes up as the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] price depreciates; the put option's value goes down as the underlying stock appreciates.
-   When an investor purchases a put, she expects the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] to decline in price.

## The Basics of Put Options

Puts are traded on various [[Underlying|underlying]] assets, which can include [[Stocks|stocks]], currencies, commodities, and indexes. The buyer of a put option may sell, or [[exercise]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp), the underlying asset at a specified [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp).

Put options are traded on various [[Underlying|underlying]] assets, including [[Stocks|stocks]], currencies, bonds, commodities, [[Futures|futures]], and indexes. They are key to understanding when choosing whether to perform [a straddle or a strangle](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/052805.asp).

The value of a put option appreciates as the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] depreciates relative to the strike price. On the flip side, the value of a put option decreases as the underlying stock increases. A put option's value also decreases as its expiration date approaches. Conversely, a put option loses its value as the underlying stock increases.

Because put options, when exercised, provide a short position in the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset, they are used for hedging purposes or to speculate on downside [[Price Action|price action]]. Investors often use put options in a [[Risk|risk]]-management strategy known as a [protective put](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protective-put.asp). This strategy is used as a form of investment insurance to ensure that losses in the underlying asset do not exceed a certain amount, namely the strike price.

In general, the value of a put option decreases as its time to expiration approaches due to time decay because the probability of the [[Stock|stock]] falling below the specified strike price decreases. When an option loses its time value, the [intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp) is left over, which is equivalent to the difference between the strike price less the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock price. If an option has intrinsic value, it is [in the money (ITM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp).

[Out of the money (OTM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp) and [at the money (ATM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp) put options have no intrinsic value because there would be no benefit of exercising the option. Investors could [short sell](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) the [[Stock|stock]] at the current higher market price, rather than exercising an out of the money put option at an undesirable strike price.

The possible payoff for a holder of a put is illustrated in the following diagram:

## Puts vs. Calls

[Derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) are financial instruments that derive value from price movements in their [[Underlying|underlying]] assets, which can be a commodity such as gold or [[Stock|stock]]. Derivatives are largely used as insurance products to [[Hedge|hedge]] against the [[Risk|risk]] that a particular event may occur. The two main types of derivatives used for [[Stocks|stocks]] are put and call options.

A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy a [[Stock|stock]] at a certain price in the future. When an investor buys a call, she expects the value of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset to go up.

A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a [[Stock|stock]] at a certain price in the future. When an investor purchases a put, she expects the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset to decline in price; she may sell the option and [[Gain|gain]] a profit. An investor can also [[write]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp) a put option for another investor to buy, in which case, she would not expect the stock's price to drop below the [[Exercise Price|exercise price]].

## Example—How Does a Put Option Work?

An investor purchases one put option contract on ABC company for $100. Each option contract covers 100 [[Shares|shares]]. The [[Exercise Price|exercise price]] of the shares is $10, and the current ABC share price is $12. This put option contract has given the investor the right, but not the obligation, to sell 100 shares of ABC at $10.

If ABC [[Shares|shares]] drop to $8, the investor's put option is [[in the money (ITM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp)—which means that the strike price is below the market price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset—and she can close her option position by selling the contract on the [[open market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp).

On the other hand, she can purchase 100 [[Shares|shares]] of ABC at the existing [[market price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) of $8, and then exercise her contract to sell the shares for $10. Disregarding commissions, the profit for this position is $200, or 100 x ($10 - $8). Remember that the investor paid a $100 [[Premium|premium]] for the put option, giving her the right to sell her shares at the [[Exercise Price|exercise price]]. Factoring in this initial cost, her total profit is $200 - $100 = $100.

As another way of working a put option as a [[Hedge|hedge]], if the investor in the previous example already owns 100 [[Shares|shares]] of ABC company, that position would be called a [[married put]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marriedput.asp) and could serve as a hedge against a decline in the share price.
