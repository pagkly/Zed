[[Yield Pickup]]
## DEFINITION of [[Yield Pickup]]

[Yield pickup](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pickup.asp) is the additional interest rate an investor receives by selling a lower-yielding bond and buying a higher-yielding bond. The [[Yield Pickup|yield pickup]] is done to improve the [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted performance of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]].

## BREAKING DOWN [[Yield Pickup]]

A [[Yield Pickup|yield pickup]] is an investment strategy which involves trading bonds with lower yields for bonds with higher yields. While picking up additional [[Yield|yield]] enables greater returns, the strategy also comes at a greater [[Risk|risk]]. A bond with a lower yield generally has a shorter maturity, while a bond with a higher yield [[Will|will]] typically have a longer maturity. Bonds with longer term maturities are more [[sensitive to interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest-rate-sensitivity.asp) movements in the markets. Hence, an investor is exposed to [[interest rate risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) with the longer maturity bond.

Additionally, there is a positive relationship between [[Yield|yield]] and [[Risk|risk]]. The higher the risk perceived of the bond, the higher the yield required by investors to incentivize them to purchase the bond. Bonds with a higher risk have a lower [[credit quality]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp) than bonds with lower risk. With a [[Yield Pickup|yield pickup]], then, a certain amount of risk is involved since the bond with a higher yield is often of a lower credit quality.

For example, an investor owns a bond issued by Company ABC that has a 4% [[Yield|yield]]. The investor can sell this bond in exchange for a bond issued by Company XYZ that has a yield of 6%. The investor's [[Yield Pickup|yield pickup]] is 2% (6% - 4% = 2%). This strategy can profit from either a higher [[coupon]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) or higher [[yield to maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldtomaturity.asp) (YTM) or both. Bonds that have a higher [[default risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp) often have higher yields, making a yield pickup play risky. Ideally, a yield pickup would involve bonds that have the same [[Rating|rating]] or [[credit risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp), though this is not always the case.

The [[Yield Pickup|yield pickup]] strategy is based on the [[pure yield pickup swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pureyieldswap.asp), which takes advantage of bonds that have been temporarily mispriced, buying bonds that are underpriced relative to the same types of bonds held in the [[Portfolio|portfolio]], thus paying a higher [[Yield|yield]], and selling those in the portfolio that are overpriced, which, consequently, pay a lower yield. The [[Swap|swap]] involves trading lower-coupon bonds for higher coupon bonds, increasing the [[reinvestment risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinvestmentrisk.asp) faced by the investor when interest rates decline since it is likely that the high-coupon [[bond will be “called”]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callablebond.asp) by the issuer. There is also some [[Risk|risk]] faced if interest rates go up. For instance if prevailing rates in the economy go up while the transaction is in progress or over the holding period of the bond, the investor may incur a loss.

The [[Yield Pickup|yield pickup]] strategy is entered into simply to generate higher yields. An investor does not need to speculate or predict the movement of interest rates. This strategy results in worthwhile gains if implemented properly and at the right time.
