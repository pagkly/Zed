[[Law of Supply and Demand Definition]]
## What Is the Law of [[Supply]] and Demand?

The law of [[Supply|supply]] and demand is a theory that explains the interaction between the sellers of a resource and the buyers for that resource. The theory defines the relationship between the price of a given good or product and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it. Generally, as price increases [[people are willing to supply more and demand less]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/law-supply-and-demand/) and vice versa when the price falls.

### Key Takeaways

-   The law of demand says that at higher prices, buyers [[Will|will]] demand less of an economic good.
-   The law of [[Supply|supply]] says that at higher prices, sellers [[Will|will]] supply more of an economic good.
-   These two laws interact to determine the actual market prices and volume of goods that are traded on a market.
-   Several independent factors can affect the shape of market [[Supply|supply]] and demand, influencing both the prices and quantities that we observe in markets.

## Understanding the Law of [[Supply]] and Demand

The law of [[Supply|supply]] and [[demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/law-demand/), one of the most basic economic laws, ties into almost all economic principles in some way. In practice, people's willingness to supply and demand a good determines the market equilibrium price, or the price where the quantity of the good that people are willing to supply just equals the quantity that people demand. However, multiple factors can affect both supply and demand, causing them to increase or decrease in various ways.

## Law of Demand vs. Law of [[Supply]]

The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a good, the less people [[Will|will]] demand that good. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]]. The amount of a good that buyers purchase at a higher price is less because as the price of a good goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that good. As a result, people will naturally avoid buying a product that will force them to forgo the consumption of something else they value more. The chart below shows that the curve is a downward slope.

Like the law of demand, the [[law of supply]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofsupply.asp) demonstrates the quantities that [[Will|will]] be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the [[Supply|supply]] relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the [[quantity supplied]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitysupplied.asp). From the seller's perspective, the opportunity cost of each additional unit that they sell tends to be higher and higher. Producers supply more at a higher price because the higher selling price justifies the higher opportunity cost of each additional unit sold.

For both [[Supply|supply]] and demand, it is important to understand that time is always a dimension on these charts. The [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] or supplied, found along the horizontal axis, is always measured in units of the good over a given time interval. Longer or shorter time intervals can influence the shapes of both the supply and demand curves.

At any given _point_ in time, the [[supply]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/[[Supply|supply]]/) of a good brought to market is fixed. In other words the supply curve in this case is a vertical line, while the [[Demand Curve|demand curve]] is always downward sloping due to the [[Law Of Diminishing Marginal Utility|law of diminishing marginal utility]]. Sellers can charge no more than the market [[Will|will]] bear based on consumer demand at that point in time. Over longer intervals of time however, suppliers can increase or decrease the quantity they supply to the market based on the price they expect to be able to charge. So over time the supply curve slopes upward; the more suppliers expect to be able to charge, the more they will be willing to produce and bring to market.

For all time periods, the [[Demand Curve|demand curve]] slopes downward because of the [[Law Of Diminishing Marginal Utility|law of diminishing marginal utility]]. The first unit of good that any buyer demands [[Will|will]] always be put to that buyer's highest valued use. For each additional unit, the buyer will use it (or plan to use it) for a successively lower valued use.

## Shifts vs. Movement 

For [[Economics|economics]], the "movements" and "shifts" in relation to the [[Supply|supply]] and demand curves represent very different market phenomena.

A movement refers to a change along a curve. On the [[Demand Curve|demand curve]], a movement denotes a change in both price and [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] from one point to another on the curve. The movement implies that the demand relationship remains consistent. Therefore, a movement along the demand curve [[Will|will]] occur when the price of the good changes and the quantity demanded changes in accordance to the original demand relationship. In other words, a movement occurs when a change in the quantity demanded is caused only by a change in price, and vice versa.

Like a movement along the [[Demand Curve|demand curve]], a movement along the [[Supply|supply]] curve means that the supply relationship remains consistent. Therefore, a movement along the supply curve [[Will|will]] occur when the price of the good changes and the [[Quantity Supplied|quantity supplied]] changes in accordance to the original supply relationship. In other words, a movement occurs when a change in quantity supplied is caused only by a change in price, and vice versa.

Meanwhile, a shift in a demand or [[Supply|supply]] curve occurs when a good's [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] or supplied changes even though price remains the same. For instance, if the price for a bottle of beer was $2 and the quantity of beer demanded increased from Q1 to Q2, then there would be a shift in the demand for beer. Shifts in the [[Demand Curve|demand curve]] imply that the original demand relationship has changed, meaning that quantity demand is affected by a factor other than price. A shift in the demand relationship would occur if, for instance, beer suddenly became the only type of alcohol available for consumption.

Conversely, if the price for a bottle of beer was $2 and the [[Quantity Supplied|quantity supplied]] decreased from Q1 to Q2, then there would be a shift in the [[Supply|supply]] of beer. Like a shift in the [[Demand Curve|demand curve]], a shift in the supply curve implies that the original supply curve has changed, meaning that the quantity supplied is effected by a factor other than price. A shift in the supply curve would occur if, for instance, a natural disaster caused a mass shortage of hops; beer manufacturers would be forced to supply less beer for the same price.

## How Do [[Supply]] and Demand Create an Equilibrium Price?

Also called a market-clearing price, the [[equilibrium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp) price is the price at which the producer can sell all the units he wants to produce and the buyer can buy all the units he wants.

With an upward sloping [[Supply|supply]] curve and a downward sloping [[Demand Curve|demand curve]] it is easy to visualize that at some point the two [[Will|will]] intersect. At this point, the market price is sufficient to induce suppliers to bring to market that same quantity of goods that consumers will be willing to pay for at that price. Supply and demand are balanced, or in equilibrium. The precise price and quantity where this occurs depends on the shape and position of the respective supply and demand curves, each of which can be influenced by a number of factors.Â 

## Factors Affecting [[Supply]]

[[Supply]] is largely a function of [[production costs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/production-cost.asp) such as labor and materials (which reflect their opportunity costs of alternative uses to supply consumers with other goods); the physical technology available to combine inputs; the number of sellers and their total productive capacity over the given time frame; and taxes, regulations, or other institutional costs of production.

## Factors Affecting Demand

Consumer preferences among different goods are the most important determinant of demand. The existence and prices of other consumer goods that are substitutes or complementary products can modify demand. Changes in conditions that influence consumer preferences can also be important, such as seasonal changes or the effects of advertising. Changes in incomes can also be important in either increasing or decreasing [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] at any given price.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a simple explanation of the Law of [[Supply]] and Demand?

In essence, the Law of [[Supply]] and Demand describes a phenomenon that is familiar to all of us from our daily lives. It describes the way in which, all else being equal, the price of a good tends to increase when the supply of that good decreases (making it more rare) or when the demand for that good increases (making the good more sought after). Conversely, it describes how goods [[Will|will]] decline in price when they become more widely available (less rare) or less popular among consumers. This fundamental concept plays an important role throughout modern [[Economics|economics]].

### Why is the Law of [[Supply]] and Demand important?

The Law of [[Supply]] and Demand is important because it helps investors, [[Entrepreneurs|entrepreneurs]], and economists to understand and predict conditions in the market. For example, a company that is launching a new product might deliberately try to raise the price of their product by increasing consumer demand through advertising. At the same time, they might try to further increase their price by deliberately restricting the number of units they sell, in order to decrease supply. In this scenario, supply would be minimized while demand would be maximized, leading a higher price.

### What is an example of the Law of [[Supply]] and Demand?

To illustrate, let us continue with the above example of a company wishing to market a new product at the highest possible price. In order to obtain the highest profit margins possible, that same company would want to ensure that its production costs are as low as possible. To do so, it might secure bids from a large number of suppliers, asking each supplier to compete against one-another to [[Supply|supply]] the lowest possible price for [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] the new product. In that scenario, the supply of manufacturers is being increased in a way that decreases the cost (or âpriceâ) of manufacturing the product. Here again, we see the Law of Supply and Demand.
