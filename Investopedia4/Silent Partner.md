[[Silent Partner]]
## What Is a [[Silent Partner]]?

A [[Silent Partner|silent partner]] is an individual whose involvement in a partnership is limited to providing capital to the business. A [[silent partner]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062515/what-difference-between-silent-partner-and-general-partner.asp) is seldom involved in the partnership's daily operations and does not generally participate in management meetings. Silent partners are also known as limited partners, since their [[Liability|liability]] is typically limited to the amount invested in the partnership.

Apart from providing [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031715/what-difference-between-financial-capital-and-economic-capital.asp), an effective [[Silent Partner|silent partner]] can benefit an enterprise by giving guidance when solicited, providing business contacts to develop the business, and stepping in for mediation when a dispute arises between other partners.

Regardless of such requests, it is considered a background role that cedes control to the general partner. This requires the [[Silent Partner|silent partner]] to have full confidence in the general partner's ability to grow the business. The silent partner also may need to ensure that their management styles or corporate visions are compatible.

## How Silent Partners Work

As with other [[partnership agreements]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/which-terms-should-be-included-partnership-agreement.asp), a silent partnership generally calls for a formal agreement in writing. Prior to the formation of a silent partnership, the business must be registered either as a general partnership or a limited [[Liability|liability]] partnership per state regulations.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Entrepreneurs]] with limited capital often seek out a [[Silent Partner|silent partner]] to help get a business off the ground.
-   While not active in daily management, a [[Silent Partner|silent partner]] still may serve an advisory role.
-   A [[Silent Partner|silent partner]] can earn a [[Passive Income|passive income]] from an investment should the business become profitable.

All parties [[Will|will]] be responsible for ensuring the business's financial obligations are met, including any general expenses or applicable taxes, except those that are exempt if the partnership is formed as part of a [[limited liability company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp) (LLC).

A partnership agreement designates which parties are general partners or silent partners. This serves as an outline to which functions, both financial and operational, the general partner [[Will|will]] perform as well as the financial obligations that are assumed by the [[Silent Partner|silent partner]]. Additionally, it includes the earnings percentage due to each partner in regard to business profits.

Silent partners are liable for any losses up to their invested capital amount, as well as any [[Liability|liability]] they have assumed as part of the creation of the business. Participating as a [[Silent Partner|silent partner]] is a suitable form of investment for those who want to have a stake in a growing business without exposing themselves to unlimited liability.

Contracts should include terms for buying out the ownership stake held by a [[Silent Partner|silent partner]] or otherwise dissolving the partnership. An entrepreneur starting a business might welcome the capital provided by a silent partner when getting his business off the ground. However, if the business becomes successful, it may become preferable to buy out the silent partner rather than share profits long-term.

Buyout terms in a contract should address the possibility of an outside investor buying out a [[Silent Partner|silent partner]].

As well, a [[Silent Partner|silent partner]] might wish to dissolve a contract after a certain period if they determine the business is unlikely to become profitable. However the contract is structured, the silent partner [[Will|will]] expect a certain minimum [[Return|return]] on investment if the business becomes profitable. Their [[Risk|risk]] will likely also be limited to no more than the capital invested.
