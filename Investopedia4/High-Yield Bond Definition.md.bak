[[High-Yield Bond Definition]]
## What Are High-[[Yield]] Bonds?

High-[[Yield|yield]] bonds (also called [[junk bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp)) are bonds that pay higher interest rates because they have lower [[credit ratings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) than [[investment-grade]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentgrade.asp) bonds. High-yield bonds are more likely to [[Default|default]], so they must pay a higher yield than investment-grade bonds to compensate investors.

Issuers of high-[[Yield|yield]] [[Debt|debt]] tend to be startup companies or capital-intensive firms with high debt ratios. However, some high-yield bonds are [[fallen angels]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fallenangel.asp) that lost their [[Good Credit|good credit]] ratings.

### Key Takeaways

-   High-[[Yield|yield]] bonds, or "junk" bonds, are corporate [[Debt|debt]] securities that pay higher interest rates because they have lower credit ratings than investment-grade bonds.
-   These bonds have credit ratings below BBB- from S&P, or below Baa3 from Moody's.
-   High-[[Yield|yield]] bonds [[Offer|offer]] investors higher interest rates and potentially higher long-run returns than investment-grade bonds but are far riskier.
-   In particular, junk bonds are more likely to [[Default|default]] and display much higher price [[Volatility|volatility]].

## Understanding High-[[Yield]] Bonds

From a technical viewpoint, a high-[[Yield|yield]], or "junk" bond is pretty much the same as regular corporate bonds since they both represent [[Debt|debt]] issued by a firm with the promise to pay interest and [[Return|return]] the [[Principal|principal]] at maturity. Junk bonds differ because of their issuers' poorer credit quality.

All bonds are characterized according to this credit quality and therefore fall into one of two bond categories: high-[[Yield|yield]] and investment grade. High-yield bonds carry lower credit ratings from the leading credit agencies. A bond is considered speculative and [[Will|will]] thus have a higher yield if it has a [[Rating|rating]] below "BBB-" from S&P or below "Baa3" from [[Moody's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moodys.asp). Bonds with ratings at or above these levels are considered investment grade. Credit ratings can be as low as "D" (currently in [[Default|default]]), and most bonds with "C" ratings or lower carry a high [[Risk|risk]] of default.

High-[[Yield|yield]] bonds are typically broken down into two sub-categories:

-   [**Fallen Angels**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fallenangel.asp): This is a bond that was once investment grade but has since been reduced to junk-bond status because of the issuing company's poor credit quality.
-   [**Rising Stars**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/070816/fallen-angel-bonds-and-rising-stars-risks-and-opportunities.asp): The opposite of a fallen angel, this is a bond with a [[Rating|rating]] that has been increased because of the issuing company's improving credit quality. A rising star may still be a junk bond, but it's on its way to being investment quality.

## Advantages of High-[[Yield]] Bonds

### Higher Yields

Generally, investors in high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds can expect at least 150 to 300 basis points in additional yield compared to investment-grade bonds at any given time. In actual practice, the [[Gain|gain]] over investment-grade bonds is lower because there [[Will|will]] be more defaults. [[Mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) and exchange traded funds ([ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)) provide ways to tap into these higher yields without the undue [[Risk|risk]] of investing in just one issuer's junk bonds.

### Higher Expected Returns

While high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds suffer from the negative "junk bond" image, they actually have higher returns than investment-grade bonds over most long holding periods. For example, the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) had an average annual total [[Return|return]] of 6.44% between the beginning of 2010 and the end of 2019.

During that time, the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) returned an average of 5.93% per year. This result is in accord with modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory ([MPT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp)), which holds that investors must be compensated for higher [[Risk|risk]] with higher expected returns.

## Disadvantages of High-[[Yield]] Bonds

### [[Default Risk]]

[[Default]] is itself the most significant [[Risk|risk]] for high-[[Yield|yield]] bond investors. The primary way of dealing with [[Default Risk|default risk]] is [[Diversification|diversification]], but that limits strategies and increases fees for investors.

With investment-grade bonds, investors can buy bonds issued by individual companies or governments and [[Hold|hold]] them directly. When they hold bonds directly, investors can build [[bond ladders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondladder.asp) to reduce [[interest rate risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp). Investors can also avoid the fees related to funds buy holding individual bonds. However, the possibility of [[Default|default]] makes individual bonds too risky in the high-[[Yield|yield]] bond market.

Small investors should generally avoid buying individual high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds directly because of high [[Default Risk|default risk]]. High-yield bond ETFs and mutual funds are usually better choices for retail investors interested in this asset class.

### Higher [[Volatility]]

Historically, high-[[Yield|yield]] bond prices have been much more [[volatile]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) than their investment-grade counterparts. In 2008, high-yield bonds as an asset class lost 26.17% of their value in just one year. Between 1980 and 2020, a diversified [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of investment-grade bonds (including both corporate and government bonds) never lost more than 3% in a single calendar year.

On the whole, the [[Volatility|volatility]] of high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds is closer to the [[Stock|stock]] market than the investment-grade bond market.
