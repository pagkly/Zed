[[What Is Overreaction]]?
## What Is an Overreaction in [[Finance]] and Investing?

Overreaction is an emotional response to new information. In [[Finance|finance]] and investing, it is an emotional response to a [[Security|security]] such as a [[Stock|stock]] or other investment, which is led either by greed or fear. Investors overreacting to news cause the security to become either [[Overbought|overbought]] or oversold, until it returns to its [[intrinsic value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   An overreaction in financial markets is when prices become excessively [[Overbought|overbought]] or oversold due to psychological reasons rather than [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]].
-   Bubbles and crashes are examples of overreactions to the [[Upside|upside]] and downside, respectively.
-   The efficient markets hypothesis precludes the occurrence of overreactions, but behavioral [[Finance|finance]] predicts that they occur—and that smart investors can take advantage of them.

## Understanding Overreactions

Investors are not always rational. Instead of pricing all publicly known information perfectly and instantly, as the [[efficient market hypothesis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp) assumes, they are often affected by cognitive and emotional biases.

Some of the most influential work in [[behavioral finance]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/032905.asp) concerns the initial under-reaction and subsequent overreaction of prices to new information. And many funds now use behavioral [[Finance|finance]] strategies to exploit these biases in their portfolios, especially in less efficient markets such as small-cap [[Stocks|stocks]].

Funds that seek to take advantage of overreaction look for companies whose [[Shares|shares]] have been depressed by bad earnings news, but where the news is likely to be temporary. Low [[price-to-book]](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/using-price-to-book-ratio-evaluate-companies/) [[Stocks|stocks]], otherwise known as [[value stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuestock.asp), are an example of such stocks.

In contrast to overreaction, under-reaction to new information is more likely to be permanent and is caused by [[anchoring]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp), a term that describes people's attachment to old information, which is especially strong when that information is critical to a coherent way of explaining the world (also known as a hermeneutic) held by the investor. Anchoring ideas like "brick and mortar retail stores are dead" can cause investors to miss undervalued [[Stocks|stocks]] and opportunities for profit.

## Examples of Overreaction

All asset bubbles are examples of overreaction, from the [[tulip mania]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tulipmania.asp) in Holland in the 17th century to the [[meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies in 2017]](https://www.investopedia.com/news/[[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]]-bubble-more-housing-or-dotcom/).

Asset [[bubbles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp) form when the rising price of an asset starts to attract investors as the primary source of [[Return|return]] rather than the fundamental returns offered by the asset. For [[Stocks|stocks]], the "fundamental" return is the growth of the company and possibly the dividend offered by the [[Stock|stock]].

The "fundamental [[Return|return]]" of a tulip bulb in the 1600s was the beauty of the flower it produced, which is a difficult result to quantify. Because investors didn't have a good way to measure the desirability of the bulbs, price was used as that metric, and because the price of bulbs was always going up, it created the unfounded belief that the bulbs were intrinsically valuable—and a good investment.

Overreaction to the [[Upside|upside]] holds until the [[Smart Money|smart money]] begins to exit the investment, at which point the value of the [[Security|security]] starts to fall producing an overreaction to the downside. In the case of the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the market [[Correction|correction]] put many unprofitable businesses out of [[Commission|commission]], but also lowered the value of good [[Stocks|stocks]] to bargain levels. Amazon ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn)) peaked before the dotcom bubble burst at $86.88 on Dec. 6, 1999, and fell to its low of $6.98 in September of 2001, a 92.5% loss. As of January 2021, the [[Stock|stock]] is about $3,300—a 470-fold increase.1
