[[Enterprise Multiple]]
## What Is [[Enterprise Multiple]]?

[[Enterprise Multiple|Enterprise multiple]], also known as the EV multiple, is a ratio used to determine the value of a company. The enterprise multiple, which is enterprise value divided by [[earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp), looks at a company the way a potential acquirer would by considering the company's [[Debt|debt]]. What's considered a "good" or "bad" enterprise multiple [[Will|will]] depend on the industry.

-   It is computed by dividing enterprise value by EBITDA.
-   The [[Enterprise Multiple|enterprise multiple]] takes into account a company's [[Debt|debt]] and cash levels in addition to its [[Stock|stock]] price and relates that value to the firm's cash profitability.
-   Enterprise multiples can vary depending on the industry.
-   Higher enterprise multiples are expected in high-growth industries and lower multiples in industries with slow growth.

## What [[Enterprise Multiple]] Can Tell You

Investors mainly use a company's [[Enterprise Multiple|enterprise multiple]] to determine whether a company is undervalued or overvalued. A low ratio relative to peers or historical averages indicates that a company might be [[undervalued]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp) and a high ratio indicates that the company might be overvalued.

An [[Enterprise Multiple|enterprise multiple]] is useful for transnational comparisons because it ignores the distorting effects of individual countries' [[Taxation|taxation]] policies. It's also used to find attractive [[takeover]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/takeover.asp) candidates since [[enterprise value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp) includes [[Debt|debt]] and is a better metric than [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) for merger and acquisition (M&A) purposes.

Enterprise multiples can vary depending on the industry. It is reasonable to expect higher enterprise multiples in high-growth industries (e.g. biotech) and lower multiples in industries with slow growth (e.g. railways).

Enterprise value (EV) is a measure of the [[Economic Value|economic value]] of a company. It is frequently used to determine the value of the business if it is acquired. It is considered to be a better valuation measure for M&A than a market cap since it includes the [[Debt|debt]] an acquirer would have to assume and the cash they'd receive.

## Example of How to Use [[Enterprise Multiple]]

Dollar General ([DG](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=dg)) generated $3.18 billion in EBITDA for the [[trailing 12 months (TTM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) as of the quarter ending May 1, 2020. The company had $2.67 billion in cash and [[Cash Equivalents|cash equivalents]] and $3.97 billion in [[Debt|debt]] for the same ending quarter.1

The company's market cap was $48.5 billion as of Aug. 10, 2020. Dollar General's [[Enterprise Multiple|enterprise multiple]] is 15.7 \[($48.5 billion + $3.97 billion - $2.67 billion) / $3.18 billion\]. At the same time last year, Dollar General's enterprise multiple was 14. The increase in the enterprise multiple is largely a result of the near $15 billion increase in market cap, while EBITDA increased just around $500 million. In this example, you can see how the Enterprise Multiple calculation takes into account both the cash the company has on hand and the [[Debt|debt]] the company is liable for.

## Limitations of Using [[Enterprise Multiple]]

An [[Enterprise Multiple|enterprise multiple]] is a metric used for finding attractive buyout targets. But, beware of [[value traps]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuetrap.asp)—[[Stocks|stocks]] with low multiples because they are deserved (e.g. the company is struggling and won't recover). This creates the illusion of a value investment, but the [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] of the industry or company point toward [negative returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-[[Return|return]].asp).

Investors assume that a [[Stock|stock]]'s past performance is indicative of future returns and when the multiple comes down, they often jump at the opportunity to buy it at a "cheap" value. Knowledge of the industry and company [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] can help assess the stock's actual value.

One easy way to do this is to look at expected (forward) profitability and determine whether the projections pass the test. Forward multiples should be lower than the TTM multiples. Value traps occur when these forward multiples look overly cheap, but the reality is the projected EBITDA is too high and the [[Stock|stock]] price has already fallen, likely reflecting the market's cautiousness. As such, it's important to know the catalysts for the company and industry.
