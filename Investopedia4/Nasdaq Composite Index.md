[[Nasdaq Composite Index]]
## What Is the [[Nasdaq Composite Index]]?

The [[Nasdaq Composite Index]] is the [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] index of over 2,500 common equities [[Listed|listed]] on the [[Nasdaq]] [[Stock|stock]] exchange. The types of securities in the index include [[American depositary receipts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp), common [[Stocks|stocks]], [[real estate investment trusts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) (REITs) and [[tracking stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trackingstocks.asp), as well as limited partnership interests. The index includes all Nasdaq-listed stocks that are not derivatives, preferred [[Shares|shares]], funds, [[exchange-traded funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/understanding-etfs/) (ETFs) or [[debenture]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debenture.asp) securities.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Nasdaq Composite Index]] is a large market-cap-[[Weighted|weighted]] index of more than 2,500 [[Stocks|stocks]], American depositary receipts (ADRs), and real [[Estate|estate]] investment trusts (REITs), among others.
-   The index is calculated constantly throughout the trading day with the final value reported at 4:16 p.m. daily once prices have fully settled after the 4:00 p.m. ET market close.
-   The Index's composition is nearly 50% technology, with consumer services, health care and financials the next most prominent industries.

## Understanding [[Nasdaq Composite Index]]

The [[Nasdaq]] Composite is not limited to companies that have U.S. headquarters—something that sets it apart from a number of other indexes. It is very common to hear the closing price of the [[Nasdaq Composite Index]] reported in the financial press or as part of the evening news because it is such a broad-based [[Market Index|market index]].

## [[Nasdaq]] Methodology

The [[Nasdaq Composite Index]] uses a [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] weighting methodology. The index's value equals the total value of the share weights of each of the constituent securities, multiplied by each [[Security|security]]'s last price. This total is then adjusted by dividing by an index divisor, which scales the value to a more appropriate figure for reporting purposes. The index is calculated continuously throughout the trading day, but it is reported once per second, with the final confirmed value being reported at 4:16 p.m. each trading day.

Two versions of the [[Nasdaq Composite Index]] are calculated: a price [[Return|return]] index and a total return index. The total return index includes the [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] of cash dividends on their respective dividend ex-dates. Both versions of the index include non-dividend cash distributions. On the market close of Sept. 24, 2003, both versions of the index were synchronized.

Changes in price due to corporate actions such as [[stock splits]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-[[Stock|stock]]-split-why-do-[[Stocks|stocks]]-split/)[, stock dividends or spinoffs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arr.asp) are made on the action's ex-date. Changes in total [[Shares|shares]] outstanding due to items such as conversions, [[stock repurchases]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalbudgeting.asp), secondary offerings or acquisitions are usually made on the night before the action's effective date.

Eligibility requirements for the index are reviewed throughout the year. A [[Security|security]] that does not meet the eligibility requirements can be removed at any time, usually at its last sale price.

The [[Nasdaq Composite Index]] is one of the most widely-watched indexes in the world and is often seen as a stand-in for the technology sector, due to its heavy weighting in technology.

## [[Nasdaq]] Composite Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for inclusion in the [[Nasdaq Composite Index]], the [[Security|security]]'s U.S. listing must be exclusively on the [[Nasdaq]] [[Stock]] Market (unless the security was dually [[Listed|listed]] on another U.S. market prior to January 1, 2004, and has continuously maintained such listing). The type of security must be one of the following:

-   American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) 
-   [[Common Stock]]
-   Limited Partnership Interests 
-   Ordinary [[Shares]] 
-   Real [[Estate]] Investment Trusts (REITs) 
-   [[Shares]] of Beneficial Interest (SBIs) 
-   Tracking [[Stocks]]

[[Security]] types ineligible for inclusion are closed-end funds, convertible debentures, exchange-traded funds, preferred [[Stocks|stocks]], rights, warrants, units, and other [[Derivative|derivative]] securities. A security is removed from the Composite Index if eligibility criteria are no longer met.
