[[Debt Ratio]]
## What is a [[Debt Ratio]]?

The [[debt ratio is a financial ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121514/what-difference-between-interest-coverage-ratio-and-dscr.asp) that measures the extent of a company’s [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]]-to-capitalratio.asp). The [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] is defined as the ratio of [[total debt to total assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totaldebttototalassets.asp), expressed as a decimal or percentage. It can be interpreted as the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt.

A ratio greater than 1 shows that a considerable portion of [[Debt|debt]] is funded by assets. In other words, the company has more liabilities than assets. A high ratio also indicates that a company may be putting itself at a [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]] on its loans if interest rates were to rise suddenly. A ratio below 1 translates to the fact that a greater portion of a company's assets is funded by [[Equity|equity]].

The [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] commonly refers to the [[debt-to-assets ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totaldebttototalassets.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] measures the amount of [[Leverage|leverage]] used by a company in terms of total [[Debt|debt]] to total assets.
-   A [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] greater than 1.0 (100%) tells you that a company has more [[Debt|debt]] than assets.
-   Meanwhile, a [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] less than 100% indicates that a company has more assets than [[Debt|debt]].
-   [[Debt]] ratios vary widely across industries, with capital-intensive businesses such as utilities and pipelines having much higher debt ratios than other industries such as the technology or services sector. 

## The Formula for the [[Debt Ratio]] Is

[[Debt]] ratio\=Total debtTotal assets\\begin{aligned} &\\text{[[Debt Ratio|Debt ratio]]} = \\frac{\\text{Total debt}}{\\text{Total assets}} \\end{aligned}

## What Does the [[Debt Ratio]] Tell You?

The higher the [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]], the more [[leveraged]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp) a company is, implying greater financial [[Risk|risk]]. At the same time, leverage is an important tool that companies use to grow, and many businesses find sustainable uses for [[Debt|debt]]. 

[[Debt]] ratios vary widely across industries, with [[capital-intensive]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/total-debttocapitalization-ratio.asp) businesses such as utilities and pipelines having much higher debt ratios than other industries such as the technology sector. For example, if a company has total assets of $100 million and total debt of $30 million, its [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] is 30% or 0.30. Is this company in a better financial situation than one with a debt ratio of 40%? The answer depends on the industry.

A [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] of 30% may be too high for an industry with volatile [[cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp), in which most businesses take on little [[Debt|debt]]. A company with a high debt ratio relative to its peers would probably find it expensive to borrow and could find itself in a crunch if circumstances change. The [[fracking]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fracking.asp) industry, for example, experienced tough times beginning in the summer of 2014 due to high levels of debt and plummeting energy prices.1 Conversely, a debt level of 40% may be easily manageable for a company in a sector such as utilities, where cash flows are stable and higher debt ratios are the norm.

A [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] greater than 1.0 (100%) tells you that a company has more [[Debt|debt]] than assets. Meanwhile, a debt ratio less than 100% indicates that a company has more assets than debt. Used in conjunction with other measures of financial health, the debt ratio can help investors determine a company's [[Risk|risk]] level.

Some sources define the [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] as total [[liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liability|liability]].asp) divided by total assets. This reflects a certain ambiguity between the terms "[[Debt|debt]]" and "liabilities" that depends on the circumstance. The [[debt-to-equity ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp), for example, is closely related to and more common than the debt ratio, but uses total liabilities in the numerator. In the case of the debt ratio, financial data providers calculate it using only [[long-term]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermdebt.asp) and [[short-term debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp) (including [[current portions of long-term debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentportionlongtermdebt.asp)), excluding liabilities such as [[accounts payable]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp), [[negative goodwill]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negativegoodwill.asp) and "other."

In the consumer lending and mortgages business, two common [[Debt|debt]] ratios that are used to assess a borrower’s ability to repay a [[Loan|loan]] or mortgage are the gross [[debt service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtservice.asp) ratio and the [[total debt service ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totaldebtserviceratio.asp). The gross [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] is defined as the ratio of monthly housing costs (including mortgage payments, home insurance, and property costs) to monthly income, while the total [[Debt Service|debt service]] ratio is the ratio of monthly housing costs plus other debt such as car payments and credit card borrowings to monthly income. Acceptable levels of the total debt service ratio, in percentage terms, range from the mid-30s to the low-40s.

## Examples of the [[Debt Ratio]]

Let's look at a few examples from different industries to contextualize the [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]]. Starbucks ([SBUX](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=sbux)) [[Listed|listed]] $0 in short-term and current portion of long-term [[Debt|debt]] on its balance sheet for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2017, and $3.93 billion in long-term debt. The company's total assets were $14.37 billion.2 This gives us a debt ratio of $3.93 billion ÷ $14.37 billion = 0.2734, or 27.34%.

To assess whether this is high, we should consider the [[capital expenditures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) that go into opening a Starbucks: leasing commercial space, renovating it to fit a certain layout, and purchasing expensive specialty equipment, much of which is used infrequently. The company must also hire and train employees in an industry with exceptionally high employee turnover, adhere to food safety regulations, etc. for more than 27,000 locations, in 75 countries (as of 2017).3 Perhaps 27% isn't so bad after all, and indeed the industry average was about 66% in 2017.4 The result is that Starbucks has an easy time borrowing money; creditors trust that it is in a solid financial position and can be expected to pay them back in full.

What about a technology company? For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, Facebook ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=fb)) reported its short-term and current portion of long-term [[Debt|debt]] as $280 million; its long-term debt was $5.77 billion; its total assets were $64.96 billion.5 Facebook's [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] can be calculated as ($280 million + $5.7 billion) ÷ $64.96 billion = 0.092, or 9.2%. Facebook does not borrow on the [[corporate bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp) market.6 It has an easy enough time raising capital through [[Stock|stock]].

Finally, let's look at a [[basic materials]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic_materials.asp) company, the St. Louis-based miner Arch Coal ([ARCH](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=arch)). For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the company posted short-term and current portions of long-term [[Debt|debt]] of $11 million, long-term debt of $351.84 million and total assets of $2.14 billion.7 Coal [[Mining|mining]] is extremely capital-intensive, so the industry is forgiving of [[Leverage|leverage]]: the average [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] was 61% in 2016.8 Even in this cohort, Arch Coal's debt ratio of ($11 million + $351.84 million) ÷ $2.14 billion = 16.95% is well below average.

## The Difference Between the [[Debt Ratio]] and the Long-Term [[Debt]] to Asset Ratio

While the total [[Debt|debt]] to total assets ratio includes all debts, the [[long-term debt to assets ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-term-debt-to-total-assets-ratio.asp) only takes into account long-term debts. The [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] (total debt to assets) measure takes into account both long-term debts, such as mortgages and securities, and current or short-term debts such as rent, utilities and loans maturing in less than 12 months. Both ratios, however, encompass all of a business's assets, including tangible assets such as equipment and inventory and intangible assets such as accounts receivables. Because the total debt to assets ratio includes more of a company's liabilities, this number is almost always higher than a company's long-term debt to assets ratio.
