[[What Is Recourse]]?
## [[What Is Recourse]]?

A recourse is a legal agreement that gives the [[Lender|lender]] the right to [[pledged collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp) if the borrower is unable to satisfy the [[Debt|debt]] obligation. Recourse refers to the lender's legal right to collect. Recourse lending provides protection to lenders, as they are assured of having some repayment, either in cash or liquid assets. Companies that use recourse debt have a lower [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp), as there is less [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Risk|risk]] in lending to that firm.

### Key Takeaways

-   Recourse is the [[Lender|lender]]'s legal right to collect the borrower’s pledged [[Collateral|collateral]] if the borrower does not pay their [[Debt|debt]] obligation.
-   Full recourse means that in addition to the [[Collateral|collateral]] the [[Lender|lender]] can also seize other assets from the borrower to repay the [[Debt|debt]].
-   If a borrower defaults on a recourse [[Loan|loan]], the [[Lender|lender]] might levy the borrower's bank accounts or garnish wages in order to repay the [[Debt|debt]] balance.
-   A non-recourse [[Loan|loan]], however, restricts the [[Lender|lender]] to claim only the specific asset pledged as [[Collateral|collateral]] in the event of [[Default|default]].

## Understanding Recourse

Recourse provides the legal means for a [[Lender|lender]] to seize a borrower's assets if the borrower [[defaults]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on a [[Debt|debt]]. If the debt is full recourse, the borrower is liable for the full amount of the debt even to the extent it exceeds the value of the collateralized asset.

Recourse [[Debt|debt]] allows the [[Lender|lender]] to take other assets from the borrower besides the [[Collateral|collateral]] in order to repay the debt. In most cases, the lender may obtain a [[deficiency judgment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficiency-judgment.asp) to seize unpledged assets, levy bank accounts, or [[garnish wages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/[[Garnishment|garnishment]].asp). The lender may also go after other sources of income from the borrower, such as commissions, royalties, or investment income.

## Recourse vs. Non-Recourse

Recourse loans are distinct from [[non-recourse loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonrecoursedebt.asp), which limit the [[Lender|lender]] to claiming only the specific asset pledged as [[Collateral|collateral]]. If a borrower defaults on a non-recourse [[Loan|loan]] and the value of the collateral does not cover the amount the borrower owes, the lender cannot attempt to recover the balance by seizing the borrower's other assets. The lender only has a legal right to the pledged collateral. Because of this distinction, recourse [[Debt|debt]] favors the lender, while non-recourse debt favors the borrower.

Recourse [[Debt|debt]] is the more common form of debt because it is less risky for lenders. Non-recourse debt is usually limited to longer-term loans placed on stabilized and performing assets, such as commercial real [[Estate|estate]].

Borrowers who have non-recourse loans generally must pay higher interest rates than recourse loans in order to compensate the [[Lender|lender]] for undertaking the additional [[Risk|risk]].

## Tax Impact of Recourse on Borrowers

Recourse [[Debt|debt]] has two tax implications for borrowers that translate into recognizing taxable [[Ordinary Income|ordinary income]] and reporting a loss or [[Gain|gain]]. When filing their taxes, the borrower must report as [[ordinary income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp) any part of a debt that is forgiven by the [[Lender|lender]].

For example, if a [[Lender|lender]] [[forecloses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp) on a house to recover a $150,000 [[Debt|debt]] and sells it for $125,000, the borrower still owes $25,000. If the lender forgives the $25,000, the borrower must report this amount as [[Ordinary Income|ordinary income]] for tax purposes. If the debt is non-recourse, the forgiveness of the [[Loan|loan]] does not result in taxable cancellation of debt income, since the terms of the loan do not give the lender any rights to pursue the owner personally in case of [[Default|default]].

Regardless of whether a [[Debt|debt]] is forgiven, the borrower must report a loss or [[Gain|gain]] based on the difference between the original [[Loan|loan]] amount and the amount realized in the sale of the asset. In the above example, the $25,000 must be reported as a loss. Losses incurred through the sale of deficient assets are not [[tax-deductible]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deductible.asp).

## Special Considerations

Most loans are issued with recourse language included in the [[Loan|loan]] document. The language specifies the recourse actions the [[Lender|lender]] may take along with any limitations.

Generally, whether a [[Loan|loan]] is recourse or non-recourse depends on the state where the loan originated. Most states provide for recourse for mortgage lenders, but it may be restricted in some way. For example, in some states, the deficiency judgment the [[Lender|lender]] can obtain against the borrower cannot exceed the [[fair market value (FMV)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp) of the property.

For example, consider a home that has a mortgage balance of $250,000 and a fair market value of $200,000. If the [[Lender|lender]] sells the home at auction for $150,000, it can only recover a $50,000 deficiency judgment against the borrower, which is the difference between the FMV and the amount the home sold for at auction. In some states, lenders are prohibited from obtaining deficiency judgments.
