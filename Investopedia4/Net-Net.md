[[Net-Net]]
## What Is [[Net-Net]]?

[[Net-Net|Net-net]] is a [[value investing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp) technique developed by the economist Benjamin Graham, in which a company's [[Stock|stock]] is valued based solely on its [[net current assets per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ncavps.asp) (NCAVPS).

[[Net-Net|Net-net]] investing thus focuses on [[Current Assets|current assets]], taking [[cash and cash equivalents]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashandcashequivalents.asp) at full value, then reducing accounts receivable for doubtful accounts, and reducing inventories to liquidation values. Net-net value is calculated by deducting total liabilities from the adjusted current assets. 

[[Net-Net|Net-net]] should not be confused with a [[double net lease]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-net-[[Lease|lease]].asp), which is a commercial rental agreement where the tenant is responsible for both property taxes and premiums for insuring the property.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Net-Net|net-net]] value investing strategy was developed by Benjamin Graham using [[Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS)|net current asset value per share (NCAVPS)]] as the primary measure to evaluate the merits of a [[Stock|stock]].
-   According to the [[Net-Net|net-net]] strategy, the ability to generate revenue from [[Current Assets|current assets]] is the true value proposition of a business.
-   [[Current Assets|Current assets]], which are used in the [[Net-Net|net-net]] approach, are defined as assets that are cash, and assets that are converted into cash within 12 months, including accounts receivable and inventory.
-   The [[Net-Net|net-net]] investing strategy does not consider long-term assets or liabilities, making it unreliable for long-term investments according to its critics.

## Understanding [[Net-Net]] Investing

Graham used this method at a time when financial information was not as readily available, and net-nets were more accepted as a company valuation model. When a viable company is identified as a [[Net-Net|net-net]], the analysis focused only on the firm’s [[Current Assets|current assets]] and liabilities, without taking other [[tangible assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp) or long-term liabilities into account. Advances in financial data collection now allow analysts to quickly access a firm’s entire set of financial statements, ratios, and other benchmarks.

Essentially, investing in a [[Net-Net|net-net]] was a safe play in the short term because its [[Current Assets|current assets]] were worth more than its market price. In a sense, the long-term growth potential and any value from long-term assets are free to an investor in a net-net. Net-net [[Stocks|stocks]] [[Will|will]] usually be reassessed by the market and priced closer to its true value in the short-term. Long-term, however, net-net stocks can be problematic.

The formula for net current asset value per share (CNAVPS) is:

> NCAVPS = [[Current Assets]] - (Total Liabilities + [[Preferred Stock]]) ÷ # [[Shares]] Outstanding

According to Graham, investors [[Will|will]] benefit greatly if they invest in companies where the [[Stock|stock]] prices are no more than 67% of their NCAV per share. And, in fact, a study done by the State University of New York showed that from the period of 1970 to 1983 an investor could have earned an [average return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averagereturn.asp) of 29.4%, by purchasing [[Stocks|stocks]] that fulfilled Graham's requirement and holding them for one year.1

However, Graham made it clear that not all [[Stocks|stocks]] chosen using the NCAVPS formula would have strong returns, and that investors should also diversify their [holdings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Holdings|holdings]].asp) when using this strategy. Graham recommended holding at least 30 stocks.

## Special Considerations 

[[Current Assets|Current assets]], which are used in the [[Net-Net|net-net]] approach, are defined as assets that are [[cash]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/pay-in-cash.asp), and assets that are converted into cash within 12 months, including accounts receivable and inventory. As a business sells inventory, and customers submit payments, the firm reduces inventory levels and receivables. This ability to collect cash is the true value of a business, according to the net-net approach. Current assets are reduced by current liabilities, such as accounts payable, to calculate net current assets. Long-term assets and liabilities are excluded from this analysis, which only focuses on cash that the firm can generate within the next 12 months.

## Criticisms of [[Net-Net]] 

The reason [[Net-Net|net-net]] [[Stocks|stocks]] may not be a great [[long-term investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/082100.asp) is simply because management teams rarely choose to fully [[Liquidate|liquidate]] the company at the first sign of trouble. In the short-term, a net-net [[Stock|stock]] may make up the gap between [[Current Assets|current assets]] and market cap, but over the long-term, an incompetent management team or a flawed business model can ruin a balance sheet quite rapidly. 

So a [[Net-Net|net-net]] [[Stock|stock]] may find itself in that position because the market has already identified long-term issues that [[Will|will]] negatively affect that stock. For example, the rise of Amazon has pushed various retailers into net-net positions over time and some investors have profited in the short-term. In the long-term, however, many of those same [[Stocks|stocks]] have gone under or been acquired at a discount. 

The [[Net-Net|net-net]] strategy of finding companies with a market value below its net-net [[working capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100715/why-working-capital-management-important-company.asp) may be an effective strategy for small investors. (Net-net working capital is calculated as cash and [[Short-Term Investments|short-term investments]] + (75% of accounts receivable) + (50% of inventory) - total liabilities.) Net-net companies are sought after by day traders which may contribute to their rise in month-to-month valuation.
