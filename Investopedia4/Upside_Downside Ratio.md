[[Upside]]/Downside Ratio
## DEFINITION of [[Upside]]/Downside Ratio

The [[Upside|upside]]/downside ratio is a [[market breadth]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market_breadth.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between the volumes of advancing and declining issues on an exchange. Investors typically use the indicator to determine the [[Momentum|momentum]] of the market at any given time.

The [[Upside|upside]]/downside ratio is calculated as follows:

[[Upside]]/Downside Ratio\=Advancing IssuesDeclining Issueswhere:Advancing Issues\=total volume traded of securities thatclose above their opening priceDeclining Issues\=total volume traded of securities thatclose below their opening price\\begin{aligned} &Upside/Downside~Ratio = \\dfrac{Advancing~Issues}{Declining~Issues}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &Advancing~Issues=\\text{\\small total volume traded of securities that}\\\\&\\text{\\small close above their opening price}\\\\ &Declining~Issues=\\text{\\small total volume traded of securities that}\\\\&\\text{\\small close below their opening price}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

## BREAKING DOWN [[Upside]]/Downside Ratio

The [[Upside|upside]]/downside ratio is often smoothed using a simple [[moving average]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) to filter out smaller, less significant movements. The indicator generates values greater than 1 when the volume on advancing issues is greater than declining issues. It generates values less than 1 when the volume on the declining issues is greater than advancing issues. The upside/downside ratio, also known as the upside/downside volume ratio, is available as a technical indicator on many trading platforms.

## Trading With the [[Upside]]/Downside Ratio

_Contrarian Strategies:_ The [[Upside|upside]]/downside ratio is often used to gauge [[Overbought|overbought]] and oversold conditions in the market. Low values can indicate that the market is reaching [[oversold]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oversold.asp) levels, while high values can indicate that the market is becoming overbought. Traders should use other technical indicators in conjunction with the upside/downside ratio when building a trading strategy. For example, if the indicator has a value less than 1, traders could look for buy [[entry points]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entry-point.asp) in securities that are approaching significant support levels, such as [[Stocks|stocks]] nearing their long-term trendlines.

_Momentum/Trend Strategies:_ [[Momentum]] traders, who trade in the direction of the prevailing [[trend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp), often use the [[Upside|upside]]/downside ratio to confirm the broader market has support from institutional investors. Traders may decide to use the indicator as a trade entry filter. For instance, they may only buy a [[stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp) when the indicator is above 1.5 or take a short position when it is below 0.5.

Other technical indicators, such as the [[relative strength index (RSI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) and [[Stochastic Oscillator|stochastic oscillator]] could be used with the [[Upside|upside]]/downside ratio to ensure the market is not in an extreme [[Overbought|overbought]] or oversold condition and due for a price [[Correction|correction]]. For example, if the indicator has a value less than 0.5 and the RSI is below 30, it may be prudent to avoid entering a short position until a short-term [[Retracement|retracement]] occurs.
