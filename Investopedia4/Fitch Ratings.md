[[Fitch Ratings]]
## What Is [[Fitch Ratings]]?

[[Fitch Ratings]] is an international [[credit rating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) agency based out of New York City and London. Investors use the company's ratings as a guide as to which investments [[Will|will]] not [[Default|default]] and subsequently [[Yield|yield]] a solid [[Return|return]]. Fitch bases the ratings on factors, such as what kind of [[Debt|debt]] a company holds and how sensitive it is to systemic changes like interest rates.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch ratings]] is a credit [[Rating|rating]] agency that rates the viability of investments relative to the likelihood of [[Default|default]].
-   Fitch is one of the top three credit [[Rating|rating]] agencies internationally, along with Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
-   Fitch uses a letter system; for example, a company rated AAA is very high quality with reliable cash flows, while a company rated D has already defaulted.

## Understanding [[Fitch Ratings]]

Along with [[Moody's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moodys.asp) and [[Standard & Poor's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp) (S&P’s), Fitch is one of the top three credit [[Rating|rating]] agencies in the world. The Fitch rating system is very similar to that of S&P in that they both use a letter system.

The Fitch [[Rating|rating]] system is as follows:

_Investment grade_

-   AAA: companies of exceptionally high quality (established, with consistent cash flows)
-   AA: still high quality; still has a low [[Default Risk|default risk]].
-   A: low [[Default Risk|default risk]]; slightly more vulnerable to business or economic factors
-   BBB: a low expectation of [[Default|default]]; business or economic factors could adversely affect the company

_Non-investment grade_

-   BB: elevated vulnerability to [[Default Risk|default risk]], more susceptible to adverse shifts in business or [[Economic Conditions|economic conditions]]; still financially flexible
-   B: degrading financial situation; highly speculative
-   CCC: a real possibility of [[Default|default]]
-   CC: [[Default|default]] is a strong probability
-   C: [[Default|default]] or default-like process has begun
-   RD: issuer has defaulted on a payment
-   D: defaulted

## [[Fitch Ratings]] and Sovereign Nations

Fitch offers [[sovereign credit ratings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-credit-[[Rating|rating]].asp) that describe each nation’s ability to meet its [[Debt|debt]] obligations. Sovereign credit ratings are available to investors to help give them insight into the level of [[Risk|risk]] associated with investing in a particular country. Countries [[Will|will]] invite Fitch and other credit rating agencies to evaluate their economic and political environments and financial situations to determine a representative rating. It’s very important to obtain the best sovereign credit rating possible, particularly in the case of developing nations, as it aids in accessing funding in international bond markets.

In 2018 Fitch awarded the United States with the highest AAA sovereign credit [[Rating|rating]]. On the lower end was Brazil with a BB-.12

## [[Fitch Ratings]] and Individual Credit Scores

While Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P ratings often correlate with companies, institutions, and nations many credit [[Rating|rating]] agencies also [[Offer|offer]] individual [[credit scores]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp). These play central roles in lenders’ decisions to extend credit.

For example, those with credit scores below 640 are generally considered to be [[subprime borrowers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-borrower.asp), for which lending institutions often charge higher interest than they would for a conventional mortgage. This is in order to compensate themselves for carrying the additional [[Risk|risk]]. For subprime borrowers, lenders may also require shorter repayment terms or a co-signer for borrowers with a low [[Credit Score|credit score]].
