[[Morbidity Rate]]
## What is the [[Morbidity Rate]]

The [[Morbidity Rate|morbidity rate]] is the frequency or proportion with which a disease appears in a population. Morbidity rates are used in actuarial professions, such as [[health insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp), [[life insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp), and [[long-term care insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ltcinsurance.asp) to determine the premiums to charge to customers. Morbidity rates help insurers predict the likelihood that an insured [[Will|will]] contract or develop any number of specified diseases and thus develop competitively-priced insurance policies in its regulated industry. Morbidity rate should not be confused with mortality rate, which is the frequency of death in a given population.

## BREAKING DOWN [[Morbidity Rate]]

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines morbidity as "any departure, subjective or objective, from a state of physiological or psychological well-being." In practical language, morbidity comprises "disease, injury, and disability." Morbidity rates refer to either incidence or prevalence. The proportion of _initial_ cases of a disease to a population is an [[incidence rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incidence-rate.asp), while the proportion of initial and _existing_ cases of disease to a population is known as the prevalence rate. For example, 50,000 new cases of heart disease developed in a city with a population of 5 million in one year; the (morbidity) incidence rate, then, is 1%. If 250,000 people already suffer from heart disease in the city, the prevalence rate increases from 5% to 6%.

The ability to accurately estimate morbidity rates for various diseases is important for insurers to set aside sufficient funds to cover benefits and claims for their customers. [[Morbidity Rate|Morbidity rate]] data is also used in part to establish prices for the premiums that the insurance companies charge. Other main factors in pricing premiums are mortality rates, [[operating expenses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp), investment returns, and regulations. As an example, Prudential Financial, Inc. bases its pricing of group insurance products on an expected [[Payout|payout]] of benefits using its assumptions for mortality, morbidity, interest, expenses, and persistence.
