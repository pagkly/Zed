## [[What Is a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)]]?

A thrift savings plan (TSP) is a type of retirement investment program open to federal employees and members of the uniformed services, including the Ready Reserve.

The TSP is a [defined-contribution plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedcontributionplan.asp) that offers federal employees many of the same benefits that are available to workers in the private sector. It closely resembles a 401(k) plan.

### Key Takeaways

-   A thrift savings plan is similar to a 401(k) plan but is open only to federal employees and uniformed services personnel.
-   Participants in a TSP can get an immediate tax break for their savings or invest in a Roth for freedom from taxes after retirement.
-   Participants can put their money into any of six investing options.

## How a TSP Works

TSP benefits can include automatic [[Payroll|payroll]] contributions and agency matching contributions.

Participants can choose to make tax-deferred contributions into a traditional TSP, which means the money that flows into the account [[Will|will]] not be taxed until it is withdrawn.

However, participants may also choose to invest in a Roth TSP. This option allows employees to make after-tax contributions into their plans so that they'll owe nothing in taxes when they withdraw the money after retiring.

Employees new to federal employment can roll over [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) and individual retirement account (IRA) assets into a TSP and vice versa if they move to the private sector.

A thrift savings plan (TSP) is a defined-contribution retirement plan that has many of the advantages of private-sector plans.

## Investing Options

The TSP offers a [[choice of six funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061113/breaking-down-tsp-investment-funds.asp) to invest in. These options are the Government Securities Investment (G) Fund, the Fixed-Income Index Investment (F) Fund, the Common-[[Stock]] Index Investment (C) Fund, the Small-Capitalization Stock Index Investment (S) Fund, the International-Stock Index Investment (I) Fund, as well as specific life-cycle (L) funds designed to include a mix of securities held in each of the individual funds.

The F, S, C, and I funds in the TSP are [[index funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) currently managed by the BlackRock Institutional Trust Company under contract by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB). This independent government agency administers the TSP and acts as a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary]] legally liable to manage the TSP prudently and in the best interests of participants and their beneficiaries.

Index funds in the TSP are designed to mimic the [[Return|return]] characteristics of the corresponding benchmark index. For example, the C Fund is invested in a [[Stock|stock]] index fund replicating the [[Standard and Poor’s 500 Index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp), which is made up of the [[Stocks|stocks]] of 500 large to medium-sized U.S. companies. L funds are invested in the five individual TSP funds, and their asset allocations are based on the individual investor's time horizon.
