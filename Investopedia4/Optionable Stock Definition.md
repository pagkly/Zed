[[Optionable Stock Definition]]
## What Is an Optionable [[Stock]]?

An optionable [[Stock|stock]] is one where the [[stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) has the necessary [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) such that a [[market maker]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp), like a bank or an accredited financial institution, lists that stock's options for trading.

### Key Takeaways

-   An optionable [[Stock|stock]] is one where the stock has the necessary [[Liquidity|liquidity]] such that a market maker, like a bank or an accredited financial institution, lists that stock's options for trading.
-   Currently, there are more than 5,000 companies with optionable [[Stocks|stocks]], as well as several hundred more exchange traded funds (ETF) with [[Listed|listed]] options.
-   If a [[Stock|stock]] is not optionable, it is more difficult to [[Hedge|hedge]] positions in that stock, which makes it harder to mitigate the risks involved.

## Understanding Optionable [[Stocks]]

An optionable [[Stock|stock]] is one that has [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) [[Listed|listed]] and tradable on a market [[exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp). Not all companies that trade publicly on stock markets have exchange traded options. This is due in part to certain minimum requirements that need to be met, such as a minimum share price and minimum amount of [[outstanding shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp).

Currently, there are more than 5,000 companies with optionable [[Stocks|stocks]], as well as several hundred more [[exchange traded funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (ETF) with [[Listed|listed]] options. A [[Stock|stock]] being optionable allows investors to purchase options on the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock, giving them the right to buy or sell [[Shares|shares]] of that underlying stock at a set price.

If a [[Stock|stock]] is not optionable, it is more difficult to [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) positions in that stock, which makes it harder to mitigate the risks involved. For [[Stocks|stocks]] like these, an investor can arrange for an [[over-the-counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) options contract to be written with their [[broker-dealer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp). It is quite easy these days to look up online if a stock has [[Listed|listed]] options on it or not. The easiest way to check whether a stock is optionable is to go to the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cboe.asp) (CBOE) website and check whether there are options listed for a particular stock.

## Minimum Criteria for an Optionable [[Stock]]

In order to have options [[Listed|listed]] for a [[Stock|stock]], it must meet certain criteria. Under current CBOE rules, there are five primary criteria that a company must meet before options on its stock can be traded on the options exchange:

1.  The [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Equity|equity]] [[Security|security]] must be [[Listed|listed]] on a recognized exchange such as the NYSE, AMEX, or [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]]. It cannot trade over the counter, such as on the [[pink sheets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp) or a bulletin board, like [[over-the-counter-bulletin-board]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcbb.asp) (OTCBB).
2.  The closing price of the company's [[Shares|shares]] in the market must have a minimum per-share price for a majority of trading days during the three prior calendar months. The current minimum price is $3.00 per share for "[covered securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredsecurity.asp)" or $7.50 per share for [[non-covered securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-covered-[[Security|security]].asp).
3.  There must exist a minimum of 7,000,000 [[Shares|shares]] of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] that are owned by persons other than those required to report their [[Stock|stock]] [[Holdings|holdings]] under [[Section 16(a)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-16.asp) of the [[Securities Exchange Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seact1934.asp) of 1934.
4.  The company must have at least 2,000 unique shareholders.
5.  The trading volume (in all markets in which the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] is traded) has been, on average, at least 2,400,000 [[Shares|shares]] in the preceding twelve months.

If a company does not meet any one of these criteria, options exchanges, like the CBOE, [[Will|will]] not allow any options to be traded on the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]]. Additionally, because of the second condition [[Listed|listed]] above, a company cannot have options traded on it until at least three months after its [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO) date.
