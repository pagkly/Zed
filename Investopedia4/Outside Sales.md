## Understanding [[Outside Sales]]

[[Outside Sales|Outside sales]] employees, also known as "field sales," tend to work without a formalized schedule, which may [[Offer|offer]] flexibility but may also mean that a salesperson is always on call to meet the demands of a customer.

This type of work entails maintaining a schedule of client meetings and having to meet and adjust to their demands and changes, such as delays and cancellations. [[Outside Sales|Outside sales]] professionals also must manage their own travel, which may be subjected to unexpected delays or other issues. In addition, since outside sales professionals must meet face-to-face with potential customers, they have to pay close attention to their appearance and must be prepared to entertain clients and [[network]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networking.asp) at all times.

Maintaining an [[Outside Sales|outside sales]] force can be expensive since companies typically have to compensate outside sales personnel for miles traveled, housing, food, and entertainment. In some industries, outside sales forces are the norm because customers [[Will|will]] not move forward with a purchase solely through [[inside sales]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inside-sales.asp) strategies.

Though an [[Outside Sales|outside sales]] workforce tends to cost more than an inside sales workforce, it also tends to out earn an inside sales workforce by 12% to 18%. Outside sales professionals are often compensated via [[commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Commission|commission]].asp) on the business that they bring in. As such, the dollar amount of the business they bring in must always be weighed against the dollar cost of the nature of their profession.

## [[Outside Sales]] vs. Inside Sales

When defining [[Outside Sales|outside sales]], it is helpful to consider its analog, inside sales. Inside sales professionals tend to work inside an office environment during set hours while utilizing the telephone or a variety of other communications technologies, such as email, video conferencing, [[Social Media|social media]], or screen [[Shares|shares]]. They rarely travel to meet clients, if at all. However, given the significant advancement in technology, there is now a trend towards a hybrid inside/outside model of employment, which only requires outside sales when necessary, rather than as an essential function of bringing in business. This is particularly beneficial when a company needs to reduce costs.

Inside sales personnel tend to work within a team, with more direct supervision. They must be comfortable with [[cold calling]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coldcalling.asp) to earn new business and conversant enough to be able to explain a product or service inside out with few or no visual aids or prototypes. The widespread adoption of communications technologies has seen inside sales grow by leaps and bounds compared to [[Outside Sales|outside sales]]. One estimate has it that for every one outside sales professional that is hired, 10 inside sales people are brought onboard.

[[Outside Sales|Outside sales]] tends to be more strategic in nature, meaning that it can entail meeting with [[C-level]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-suite.asp) decision-makers to help them devise and implement business strategies. Outside sales is more likely to be utilized when selling more complex and expensive goods and services. The orders placed from the outside sales process also tend to be larger than those made by way of inside sales. Inside sales, in practice, is more of a function of the quantity of interactions over the depth of those interactions.
