[[Maximum Loan Amount]]
## What Is the [[Maximum Loan Amount]]?

A [[Maximum Loan Amount|maximum loan amount]], or [[Loan|loan]] limit, describes the total amount of money that an applicant is authorized to borrow. Maximum loan amounts are used for standard loans, credit cards, and line-of-credit accounts.

The maximum [[Will|will]] depend on several factors including a borrower's [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]], length of the [[Loan|loan]], loan purpose, whether the loan is backed by [[Collateral|collateral]], as well as various criteria of the [[Lender|lender]].

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Maximum Loan Amount|maximum loan amount]] describes the total sum that one is authorized to borrow on a line of credit, credit card, personal [[Loan|loan]], or mortgage.
-   In determining an applicant's [[Maximum Loan Amount|maximum loan amount]], lenders consider [[Debt|debt]]-to-income ratio, [[Credit Score|credit score]], credit history, and financial profile.

## Understanding the [[Maximum Loan Amount]]

A [[Maximum Loan Amount|maximum loan amount]] for a borrower is based on a combination of factors and determined by a [[Loan|loan]] [[underwriter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp). It is the maximum amount of money that [[Will|will]] be provided to a borrower if the loan is approved. Lenders consider a borrower’s [[debt-to-income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp) ratio during the underwriting process, which helps to determine how much they believe the borrower would be able to repay and therefore what the maximum loan amount should be. Lenders generally seek borrowers with [[Debt|debt]]-to-income ratios of 36% or less.

Lenders must also consider their own [[Risk|risk]] parameters when determining a borrower’s total [[Principal|principal]]. Thus, maximum [[Loan|loan]] amounts can also be based on the risk [[Diversification|diversification]] of a [[Lender|lender]].

In addition to the applicant's [[Debt|debt]]-to-income ratio, underwriters take into account a variety of factors, including [[Credit Score|credit score]] and credit history, in determining the [[Maximum Loan Amount|maximum loan amount]] an applicant can borrow.

## [[Unsecured]] Lending

Credit cards are an example of [[Unsecured|unsecured]] lending. Credit card issuers also use underwriting to determine how much they trust a borrower to repay—the [[Maximum Loan Amount|maximum loan amount]] or credit limit. One of the primary factors they consider is credit history, which includes repayment history, the number of credit accounts on a report, and the length of a person's credit history. Credit card issuers [[Will|will]] also check the number of inquiries on a credit report and the derogatory marks, which include bankruptcies, collections, civil judgments, and tax liens. They also may take into account an applicant's work history.

[Personal loans](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-[[Loan|loan]]-5076027) are also available [[Unsecured|unsecured]]. Banks, [[peer-to-peer (P@P) websites]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092315/7-best-peertopeer-lending-websites.asp), and other lenders use credit history, [[Debt|debt]]-to-income ratio and other types of underwriting to set the rates at which they are willing to lend money. The better your credit [[Rating|rating]], the better the rates you [[Will|will]] be offered; [[people with excellent credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-personal-loans-for-excellent-credit-4797495) are offered much lower rates than [[those with bad credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-personal-loans-for-bad-credit-4774349).

Personal [[lines of credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lineofcredit.asp) (LOC) are another form of [[Unsecured Loan|unsecured loan]], which give you access to an amount of money that you can borrow when you need it—and there's no interest until you borrow. Having better credit scores may help you qualify for a lower annual percentage rate.

## Secured Lending

With [[secured loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-loans-5076025)—specifically mortgage loans**—**lenders use an additional [[qualifying ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifying_ratios.asp) called the [[housing expense ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_expense_ratio.asp), which compares the borrower's housing expenses to their pre-tax income. Housing expenses generally include the potential mortgage [[Principal|principal]] and interest payments, property taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage insurance, and association fees. Lenders [[Will|will]] typically look for a housing expense ratio no higher than 28%. Similar to standard loans, secured lenders will also analyze a borrower’s [[Debt|debt]]-to-income with 36% being the common threshold required.

They also base a [[Maximum Loan Amount|maximum loan amount]] on customized [[Loan|loan]]-to-value thresholds. Secured lenders [[Will|will]] often lend between 70%-90% of a secured asset’s [[collateral value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Collateral|collateral]]-value.asp). Mortgage loans generally follow standard underwriting procedures with these variables also a part of the decision on how much to lend to a borrower.

A [[home-equity line of credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/) (HELOC) is another form of secured lending. As its name implies, the [[Maximum Loan Amount|maximum loan amount]] is based on the [[Equity|equity]] you have in your home. If you need money, it can be a better choice than a credit card because the interest rate may be lower and the amount you can borrow higher. If you have trouble paying back what you borrow, however, you can [[Risk|risk]] losing your home.

## Government-Sponsored Loans

Government-sponsored loans [[Offer|offer]] some exceptions to the underwriting requirements and maximum [[Loan|loan]] amounts for certain types of home loans. These loans may accept borrowers with [[Debt|debt]]-to-income ratios of up to 50%. In the mortgage industry, the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhfa.asp) publishes the maximum amounts for loans sponsored by Fannie Mae. [[Freddie Mac]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp) also publishes loan limits annually. Since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee a large percentage of mortgages originated in the United States, the "conforming loan limit"—that is, loans that conform to these entities' guidelines—is an important number in the mortgage [[Finance|finance]] industry.

For 2021, in most of the U.S., the maximum conforming [[Loan|loan]] limit—the baseline—for one-unit properties is $548,250, an increase from $510,400 in 2020.
