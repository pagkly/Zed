[[What Is Risk-On Risk-Off]]?
## [[What Is Risk-On Risk-Off]]?

[[Risk]]-on risk-off is an investment setting in which price behavior responds to and is driven by changes in investor risk tolerance. Risk-on risk-off refers to changes in investment activity in response to global economic patterns.

During periods when [[Risk|risk]] is perceived as low, the risk-on risk-off theory states that investors tend to engage in higher-risk investments. When risk is perceived to be high, investors have the tendency to gravitate toward lower-risk investments.

## Understanding [[Risk]]-On Risk-Off

Investors' appetites for [[Risk|risk]] rise and fall over time. At times, investors are more likely to invest in higher-risk instruments than during other periods, such as during the 2009 economic recovery period. The [2008 financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-crisis.asp) was considered a risk-off year, when investors attempted to reduce risk by selling existing risky positions and moving money to either [[cash positions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash_position.asp) or low/no-risk positions, such as U.S. Treasury bonds.

Not all [[asset classes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) carry the same [[Risk|risk]]. Investors tend to change asset classes depending on the perceived risk in the markets. For instance, [[Stocks|stocks]] are generally considered to be riskier assets than bonds. Therefore, a market where stocks are outperforming [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) is said to be a risk-on environment. When stocks are selling off and investors run for shelter to bonds or gold, the environment is said to be risk-off.

Investors invest in a [[Risk|risk]] on environment when they put their money into riskier assets.

## [[Risk]] Sentiment

While asset prices ultimately detail the [[risk sentiment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsentiment.asp) of the market, investors can often find signs of changing sentiment through corporate earnings, [[macroeconomic]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[Macroeconomics|macroeconomics]].asp) data, global central bank action and statements, and other factors.

[[Risk]]-on environments are often carried by a combination of expanding corporate earnings, optimistic economic outlook, accommodative central bank policies, and [[speculation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Speculation|speculation]].asp). We can also assume that an increase in the [[Stock|stock]] market is a sign that risk is on. As investors feel the market is being supported by strong influential [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]], they perceive less risk about the market and its outlook.

Conversely, [[Risk|risk]]-off environments can be caused by widespread corporate earnings downgrades, contracting or slowing economic data, uncertain central bank policy, a rush to safe investments, and other factors. Just like the [[Stock|stock]] market rises relating to a risk on environment, a drop in the stock market equals a risk off environment. That's because investors want to avoid risk and are averse to it.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Risk]]-on risk-off is an investment paradigm under which asset prices are dictated by changes in investors' risk tolerance.
-   In [[Risk|risk]]-on situations, investors have a high risk appetite and bid up the prices of assets in the market.
-   In [[Risk|risk]]-off situations, investors become more risk-averse and sell assets, sending their prices lower.

## Returns and [[Risk]]-On Risk-Off

As the perceived [[Risk|risk]] rises in the markets, investors jump from risky assets and pile into [[high-grade bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentgrade.asp), U.S. Treasury bonds, gold, cash, and other [[safe havens]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-haven.asp). While returns on these assets are not expected to be excessive, they provide downside protection to portfolios during times of distress.

When risks subside in the market, low-[[Return|return]] assets and safe havens are dumped for [[high-yielding bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp), [[Stocks|stocks]], [[commodities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), and other assets that carry elevated [[Risk|risk]]. As overall market risks stay low, investors are more willing to take on [[Portfolio|portfolio]] risk for the chance of higher returns.
