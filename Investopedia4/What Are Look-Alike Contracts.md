[[What Are Look-Alike Contracts]]?
## [[What Are Look-Alike Contracts]]?

Look-alike contracts are a cash-settled financial product based on the settlement price of a similar exchange-traded, physically settled [[futures contract]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp). Look-alike contracts are traded over the counter and they carry no [[Risk|risk]] of actual [[physical delivery]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physicaldelivery.asp) regardless of the terms of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Futures|futures]] contract.

[[Futures]] look-alike contracts are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading [[Commission]] ([CFTC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cftc.asp)).

### Key Takeaways

-   A look-alike contract is an [[OTC]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) derivatives contract that is cash-settled that has otherwise similar specifications to a physically settled [[Futures|futures]] contract.
-   Because physical settlement is not an issue, traders do not have to worry about closing out open positions to avoid making or taking delivery.
-   Critics argue that look-alike contracts fuel [[Speculation|speculation]] and generate market inefficiencies since they are removed from the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset that they track.

## Understanding Look-Alike Contracts

Look-alike contracts are essentially options where the [[underlying]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]].asp) is a [[Futures|futures]] contract with a specific settlement date. For example, the [[ICE]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intercontinentalexchange.asp) Brent Crude [[American]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/americanoption.asp)\-style Option Product has an ICE [[Brent Crude]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/northseabrentcrude.asp) Futures Contract as its underlying. The contract terms of a look-alike contract closely correspond with the contract terms of the futures contract. Look-alike contracts may be offered in both American and [[European]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanoption.asp) styles.

## Look-Alike Contracts and Position Limits

Where look-alike contracts get interesting is when they cover contracts traded on other exchanges, allowing the exchange to capture some of the trading activity on a commodity they are not known for. This allows some of the pure [[Risk|risk]] [[Speculation|speculation]] to take place away from the actuals in the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Futures|futures]] contracts.

Moreover, since none of the physical commodities are involved with the look-alike contract trading, the position limits meant to temper commodity [[Speculation|speculation]] can be skirted.

## Criticisms of Look-Alike Contracts

Like many [[Derivative|derivative]] products, look-alike contracts have their share of detractors. The main purpose of the [[Futures|futures]] market is traditionally to aid in price discovery and allow [[Supply|supply]] and demand risks to be hedged or offloaded onto parties better prepared to handle them.

Look-alike contracts leave the physical commodity behind by being a [[Derivative|derivative]] of a derivative. Instead of influencing the price of oil, for example, look-alike contracts allow traders to bet against one another while arguably providing no new market price signals. Traders of look-alike contracts do argue that last point, as they are market participants so the volume and open interest of their [[Speculation|speculation]] gives market information on their opinions on the price performance of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Futures|futures]] contract.

Former [[CME Group]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp) CEO, Craig Donohue called look-alike contracts “parasitic, second-order” derivatives in 2011.1 At the time, of course, ICE was aggressively creating look-alike contracts using CME-traded [[Futures|futures]] as a benchmark. The rivalry between the two exchanges no doubt colored his opinions. All in all, look-alike contracts are no different than other over-the-counter products in that they allow high-level market participants to make bets with money they are prepared to [[Risk|risk]] in a very specific way.
