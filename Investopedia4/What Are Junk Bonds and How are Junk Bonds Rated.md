[[What Are Junk Bonds and How are Junk Bonds Rated]]?
## What Is a Junk Bond?

Junk bonds are bonds that carry a higher [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]] than most bonds issued by corporations and governments. A bond is a [[Debt|debt]] or promise to pay investors interest payments along with the [[Return|return]] of invested [[Principal|principal]] in exchange for buying the bond. Junk bonds represent bonds issued by companies that are financially struggling and have a high risk of [[defaulting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) or not paying their interest payments or repaying the principal to investors.

Junk bonds are also called [[high-yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp) bonds since the higher [[Yield|yield]] is needed to help offset any [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]].

### Key Takeaways

-   A junk bond is [[Debt|debt]] that has been given a low credit [[Rating|rating]] by a ratings agency, below investment grade.
-   As a result, these bonds are riskier since chances that the issuer [[Will|will]] [[Default|default]] or experience a credit event are higher.
-   Because of the higher [[Risk|risk]], investors are compensated with higher interest rates, which is why junk bonds are also called high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds.

## Junk Bonds Explained

From a technical viewpoint, a high-[[Yield|yield]], or "junk" bond is very similar to regular corporate bonds. Both represent [[Debt|debt]] issued by a firm with the promise to pay interest and to [[Return|return]] the [[Principal|principal]] at maturity. Junk bonds differ because of their issuers' poorer credit quality.

Bonds are fixed-income [[Debt|debt]] instruments that corporations and governments issue to investors to raise capital. When investors buy bonds, they're effectively loaning money to the issuer who promises to repay the money on a specific date called the maturity date. At maturity, the investor is repaid the [[Principal|principal]] amount invested. Most bonds pay investors an annual interest rate during the life of the bond, called a [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]].

For example, a bond that has a 5% annual [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] means that an investor who purchases the bond earns 5% per year. So, a bond with a $1,000 face—or par—value [[Will|will]] receive 5% x $1,000 which comes to $50 each year until the bond matures.

## Higher [[Risk]] Equates to Higher [[Yield]]

A bond that has a high [[Risk|risk]] of the [[Underlying|underlying]] company defaulting is called a junk bond. Companies that issue junk bonds are typically start-ups or companies that are struggling financially. Junk bonds carry risk since investors are unsure whether they'll be repaid their [[Principal|principal]] and earn regular interest payments. As a result, junk bonds pay a higher [[Yield|yield]] than their safer counterparts to help compensate investors for the added level of risk. Companies are willing to pay the high yield because they need to attract investors to fund their operations.

Pros

-   Junk bonds [[Return|return]] higher yields than most other fixed-income [[Debt|debt]] securities.
    
-   Junk bonds have the potential of significant price increases should the company's financial situation improve.
    
-   Junk bonds serve as a [[Risk|risk]] indicator of when investors are willing to take on risk or avoid risk in the market.
    

Cons

-   Junk bonds have a higher [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]] than most bonds with better credit ratings.
    
-   Junk bond prices can exhibit [[Volatility|volatility]] due to uncertainty surrounding the issuer's financial performance.
    
-   Active junk bond markets can indicate an [[Overbought|overbought]] market meaning investors are too complacent with [[Risk|risk]] and may lead to market downturns.
    

## Junk Bonds as a Market Indicator

Some investors buy junk bonds to profit from potential price increases as the financial [[Security|security]] of the [[Underlying|underlying]] company improves, and not necessarily for the [[Return|return]] of interest income. Also, investors that predict bond prices to rise are betting there [[Will|will]] be increased buying interest for high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds—even these lower rated ones—due to a change in [[market risk sentiment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsentiment.asp). For example, if investors believe [[Economic Conditions|economic conditions]] are improving in the U.S. or abroad, they might purchase junk bonds of companies that will show improvement along with the economy.

As a result, increased buying interest of junk bonds serves as a market-[[Risk|risk]] indicator for some investors. If investors are buying junk bonds, market participants are willing to take on more risk due to a perceived improving economy. Conversely, if junk bonds are selling off with prices falling, it usually means that investors are more [[risk averse]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskaverse.asp) and are opting for more secure and stable investments.

Although a surge in junk bond investing usually translates to increased optimism in the market, it could also point to too much optimism in the market.

It's important to note that junk bonds have much larger price swings than bonds of higher quality. Investors looking to purchase junk bonds can either buy the bonds individually through a broker or invest in a junk bond fund managed by a professional [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]].

## Improving Financials Affect Junk Bonds

If the [[Underlying|underlying]] company performs well financially, its bonds [[Will|will]] have improved credit ratings and usually attract buying interest from investors. As a result, the bond's price rises as investors flood in, willing to pay for the financially viable issuer. Conversely, companies that are performing poorly will likely have low or lowered credit ratings. These falling opinions might cause buyers to back off. Companies with poor credit ratings typically [[Offer|offer]] high yields to attract investors and to compensate them for the added level of [[Risk|risk]].

The result is bonds issued by companies with positive credit ratings usually pay lower interest rates on their [[Debt|debt]] instruments as compared to companies with poor credit ratings. Many bond investors monitor the credit ratings of bonds.

## Credit Ratings and Junk Bonds

Although junk bonds are considered risky investments, investors can monitor a bond's level of [[Risk|risk]] by reviewing the bond's credit [[Rating|rating]]. A [[credit rating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) is an assessment of the [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]] of an issuer and its outstanding [[Debt|debt]] in the form of bonds. The company's credit rating, and ultimately the bond's credit rating, impact the market price of a bond and its [[Offering|offering]] interest rate.

[Credit-[[Rating|rating]] agencies](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/history-credit-rating-agencies.asp) measure the [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]] of all corporate and government bonds, giving investors insight into the risks involved in the [[Debt|debt]] securities. Credit rating agencies assign letter grades for their view of the issue.

For example, Standard & Poor’s has a credit [[Rating|rating]] scale ranging from AAA—excellent—to lower ratings of C and D. Any bond that carries a rating lower than BB is said to be of speculative-grade or a junk bond. This should be a red flag to [[Risk|risk]]-averse investors. The various letter grades from credit agencies represent the financial viability of the company and the likelihood that the contract terms of the bond terms [[Will|will]] be honored.

### Investment Grade

Bonds with a [[Rating|rating]] of [[investment-grade]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentgrade.asp) come from corporations that have a high probability of paying the regular coupons and returning the [[Principal|principal]] to investors. For example, Standard & Poor's ratings include:

-   AAA—excellent
-   AA—very good
-   A—good
-   BBB—adequate

### "Junk" (Speculative)

As mentioned earlier, once a bond's [[Rating|rating]] drops into the double-B category, it falls into the junk bond territory. This area can be a scary place for investors who would be harmed by a total loss of their investment dollars in the case of a [[Default|default]].

Some speculative ratings include:

-   CCC—currently vulnerable to nonpayment
-   C—highly vulnerable to nonpayment
-   D—in [[Default|default]]

Companies having bonds with these low credit ratings might have difficulty raising the capital needed to fund ongoing business operations. However, if a company manages to improve its financial performance and it's bond's credit [[Rating|rating]] is upgraded, a substantial appreciation in the bond’s price could happen. Conversely, if a company's financial situation deteriorates, the credit rating of the company and its bonds might be downgraded by credit rating agencies. It is crucial for investors in junk [[Debt|debt]] to fully investigate the [[Underlying|underlying]] business and all financial documents available before buying.

## Bond Defaults

If a bond misses a [[Principal|principal]] and interest payment, the bond is considered to be in [[Default|default]]. Default is the failure to repay a [[Debt|debt]] including interest or principal on a [[Loan|loan]] or [[Security|security]]. Junk bonds have a higher [[Risk|risk]] of default because of an uncertain revenue stream or a lack of sufficient [[Collateral|collateral]]. The risk of bond defaults increases during economic downturns making these bottom level debts even riskier.

## Real World Example of a Junk Bond

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) issued a [fixed-rate bond](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C607201) with a maturity date of March 1, 2021 and a fixed semi-annual [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] of 1.25%. The [[Debt|debt]] received an S&P [[Rating|rating]] of B- in 2014 when it was issued. In October 2020, S&P upgraded its rating to BB- from B+. This is still in junk bond rating territory. A BB rating from S&P means the rating issue is less vulnerable to nonpayment, but still faces major uncertainties or exposure to adverse business or [[Economic Conditions|economic conditions]].

Also, the current price of the Tesla [[Offering|offering]] is $577 as of Oct. 2020, much higher than its 2014 $100 face value, which represents the extra [[Yield|yield]] that investors are getting above the coupon payment. In other words, despite the BB- [[Rating|rating]], the bond is trading at very large [[Premium|premium]] to its face value. This is because the bonds are convertible to [[Equity|equity]]. Thus, with [[Shares|shares]] of Tesla soaring 600% over the last twelve months ending Oct. 26, 2020, the bonds are proving to be valuable surrogates for the equity.
