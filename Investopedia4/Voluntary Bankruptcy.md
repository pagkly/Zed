[[Voluntary Bankruptcy]]
## What Is [[Voluntary Bankruptcy]]?

[[Voluntary Bankruptcy|Voluntary bankruptcy]] is a type of [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) where an [[insolvent]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insolvency.asp) [[Debtor|debtor]] brings the petition to a court to declare bankruptcy because he or she (in the case of an individual) or it (in the case of a business entity) is unable to pay off debts.

A simple definition of [[Voluntary Bankruptcy|voluntary bankruptcy]] is simply when a [[Debtor|debtor]] chooses to go to court over bankruptcy versus being forced to do so. A voluntary bankruptcy is intended to create an orderly and equitable settlement of the debtor's obligations.

### Key Takeaways

-   This type of bankruptcy is different than an involuntary bankruptcy, which is a process originating from creditors.
-   Involuntary and technical are two other forms of bankruptcy.
-   During involuntary bankruptcy, a [[Creditor|creditor]] can force a [[Debtor|debtor]] into court in order to get paid.
-   [[Voluntary Bankruptcy|Voluntary bankruptcy]] is more common than other forms of bankruptcy.

## How [[Voluntary Bankruptcy]] Works

[[Voluntary Bankruptcy|Voluntary bankruptcy]] is a bankruptcy proceeding that a [[debtor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debtor|debtor]].asp), who knows that they cannot satisfy the [[Debt|debt]] requirements of its [[creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp), initiates with a court.

[[Voluntary Bankruptcy|Voluntary bankruptcy]] typically commences when and if a [[Debtor|debtor]] finds no other solution to their dire financial situation. Filing for voluntary bankruptcy differs from filing for [[involuntary bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/involuntary-bankruptcy.asp), which occurs when one or more creditors petitions a court to judge the debtor as insolvent (unable to pay).

## [[Voluntary Bankruptcy]] and Other Forms of Bankruptcy

In addition to [[Voluntary Bankruptcy|voluntary bankruptcy]], other forms of bankruptcy exist, including involuntary bankruptcy, and technical bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy filings vary among states, which can lead to higher or lower filing fees, depending on the location of the filing.

Creditors request involuntary bankruptcy of debtors when they [[Will|will]] not be paid without bankruptcy proceedings and need a legal requirement in order to force the [[Debtor|debtor]] to pay. A debtor must have attained a certain level of [[Debt|debt]] for a [[Creditor|creditor]] to request an involuntary bankruptcy. This level will vary, depending on if the debtor is an individual or corporation.

In a [[technical bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalbankruptcy.asp), an individual or company has defaulted on their financial obligations, yet this has not been declared in court.

## [[Voluntary Bankruptcy]] and Corporations

When a corporation goes bankrupt, either voluntarily or involuntarily, there is a specific series of events that occur for all stakeholders to receive due payments. This begins with distributing assets to [[secured creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secured-[[Creditor|creditor]].asp), who have [[Collateral|collateral]] on [[Loan|loan]] to the business.

If they cannot fetch a market price for the [[Collateral|collateral]] (which has likely depreciated over time), secured creditors can recoup some of the balance from the company’s remaining liquid assets.

Secured creditors are followed by [[unsecured creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredcreditor.asp)—those who have loaned funds to the company (i.e., bondholders, employees who are owed unpaid wages, and the government, if taxes are owed). Preferred and common shareholders, in that order, receive any outstanding assets, if any remain.

Various types of bankruptcy that a corporation can declare include Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which involves liquidation of assets; [[Chapter 11]], which deals with corporate reorganizations; and Chapter 13, which is [[Debt|debt]] repayment with lowered debt [[covenants]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp) or payment terms.1

Of all the types of bankruptcy, [[Voluntary Bankruptcy|voluntary bankruptcy]] is the most common.
