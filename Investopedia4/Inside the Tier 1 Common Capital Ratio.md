[[Inside the Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio]]
## What Is the Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio?

Tier 1 common capital ratio is a measurement of a bank's core [[Equity|equity]] capital, compared with its total [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets, and signifies a bank's financial strength. The Tier 1 common capital ratio is utilized by regulators and investors because it shows how well a bank can withstand financial stress and remain solvent. Tier 1 common capital excludes any preferred [[Shares|shares]] or [[non-controlling interests]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncontrolling_interest.asp), which makes it differ from the closely-related tier 1 capital ratio.

### Key Takeaways

-   The Tier 1 common capital ratio is a measurement of a bank's core [[Equity|equity]] capital, compared with its total [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets, that signifies a bank's financial strength.
-   The Tier 1 common capital ratio is utilized by regulators and investors because it shows how well a bank can withstand financial stress and remain solvent.
-   The Tier 1 common capital ratio differs from the closely-related Tier 1 capital ratio because it excludes any preferred [[Shares|shares]] or non-controlling interests.

#### Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio

## What Does the Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio Tell You?

A firm's [[risk-weighted assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskweightedassets.asp) include all assets that the firm holds that are systematically [[Weighted|weighted]] for credit [[Risk|risk]]. Central banks typically develop the weighting scale for different asset classes; cash and government securities carry zero risk, while a mortgage [[Loan|loan]] or car loan would carry more risk. The risk-weighted assets would be assigned an increasing weight according to their credit risk. Cash would have a weight of 0%, while loans of increasing credit risk would carry weights of 20%, 50%, or 100%.

Regulators use the Tier 1 common capital ratio to grade a firm's capital adequacy as one of the following: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. To be classified as well-capitalized, a firm must have a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 7% or greater, and not pay any dividends or distributions that would reduce that ratio below 7%.

A firm characterized as a [[systemically important financial institution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systemically-important-financial-institution-sifi.asp) (SIFI) is subject to an additional 3% cushion for its Tier 1 common capital ratio, making its threshold to be considered well-capitalized at 10%. Firms not considered well-capitalized are subject to restrictions on paying dividends and share buybacks.

The Tier 1 common capital ratio differs from the closely-related [[Tier 1 capital ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-capital-ratio.asp). Tier 1 capital includes the sum of a bank's [[Equity|equity]] capital, its disclosed reserves, and non-redeemable, non-cumulative [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]]. Tier 1 common capital, however, excludes all types of preferred [[Stock|stock]] as well as non-controlling interests. Tier 1 common capital includes the firm's [[Common Stock|common stock]], [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] and other [[Comprehensive Income|comprehensive income]].

Bank investors pay attention to the Tier 1 common capital ratio because it foreshadows whether a bank has not only the means to pay dividends and buy back [[Shares|shares]] but also the permission to do so from regulators. [[The Federal Reserve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp) assesses a bank's Tier 1 common capital ratio during stress tests to discern whether a bank can withstand economic shocks and market [[Volatility|volatility]].

## Example of the Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio

As an example, assume a bank has $100 billion of [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets after assigning the corresponding weights for its cash, credit lines, mortgages and personal loans. Its Tier 1 common capital includes $4 billion of [[Common Stock|common stock]] and $4 billion of [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]], leading to total Tier 1 common capital of $8 billion. The company also issued $500 million in preferred [[Shares|shares]]. Dividing the Tier 1 common capital of $8 billion less the $500 in preferreds by total risk-weighted assets of $100 billion yields a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 7.5%.

If we were instead computing the standard tier 1 capital ratio, it would be calculated as 8% since it would include the preferred [[Shares|shares]].
