[[Notice of Default]]
## What Is a [[Notice of Default]]?

The term [[Notice of Default|notice of default]] refers to a public notice filed with a court that states that the borrower of a [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) is in [[Default|default]] on a [[Loan|loan]]. The [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) may file a notice of default when a mortgagor falls behind on their mortgage payments. Information on notices of default normally includes the borrower and lender's name and address, the legal address of the property, the nature of the default, as well as other pertinent details. A notice of default is often considered the first step toward foreclosure.

### Key Takeaway

-   A [[Notice of Default|notice of default]] is a public notice filed with a court that states that a mortgagor is in [[Default|default]].
-   It is typically the final action lenders take before activating the [[Lien|lien]] and seizing the [[Collateral|collateral]] for foreclosure. 
-   The notice must include details such as the borrower and [[Lender|lender]]'s name and address, the property address, and the nature of the [[Default|default]].

## How Notices of [[Default]] Work

A [[Notice of Default|notice of default]] is a serious action taken by a [[Lender|lender]]. It notifies a borrower that their delinquent [[mortgage payments]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-rates/payment-structure/) have breached the limit as outlined in their mortgage [[Loan|loan]] contract. Lenders outline the number of delinquent payments allowed in a mortgage contract before [[Default|default]] action is taken. Most contracts generally allow up to 180 days of missed payments and [[delinquencies]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-are-differences-between-delinquency-and-default.asp) before any action is taken to file a notice of default.

A [[Notice of Default|notice of default]] is typically the final action lenders take before activating the [[lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp) and seizing the [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp) for foreclosure. A notice of [[Default|default]] is usually filed with the state court in which the lien is recorded followed by a hearing to activate the [[perfected lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfected-lien.asp) recorded with the mortgage closing. Some cases may allow time for the borrower to negotiate by potentially paying delinquent [[Debt|debt]] or suggesting a settlement.

If the case proceeds to the approval of the perfected property [[Lien|lien]], the [[Lender|lender]] then notifies the borrower that the lien is activated. With an activated lien and a court order for property seizure, the lender can take legal action asking the borrower to vacate the property.

All notices of [[Default|default]] contain relevant information pertaining to the borrower, [[Lender|lender]], and the property. These details include but aren't limited to:

-   The name and address of the borrower
-   The name and address of the [[Lender|lender]]
-   The legal address of the property
-   Full details on the nature of the [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp)
-   What action is required to cure the [[Default|default]]
-   The deadline and the intentions of the [[Lender|lender]] if the deadline is passed without a cure

## Special Considerations

If a borrower has several delinquent payments, they are at [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]] on a mortgage [[Loan|loan]]. This also poses the risk of lost [[Collateral|collateral]]. When this happens, the [[Lender|lender]] may file a [[Notice of Default|notice of default]]. While this notice may lead to [[foreclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp), that isn't always the case, The lender may simply be taking this step as protocol, and be willing to work with the borrower to bring the account up to date. Filing the notice may also include a negotiation [[grace period]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grace_period.asp) before further action is taken.

While some lenders use notices of [[Default|default]] as the final step before foreclosure, others use it as a way to work with borrowers to bring the mortgage up to date.

A [[Notice of Default|notice of default]] and subsequent foreclosure actions are documented and reported to [[credit bureaus]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditbureau.asp). Thus, all foreclosure proceedings and actions can have serious repercussions on a borrower’s [[credit score]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp). This [[Will|will]] also reduce the borrower’s ability to obtain a mortgage or any type of [[Debt|debt]] in the future.

Some lenders may choose to serve the delinquent borrower with a notice of intention rather than a [[Notice of Default|notice of default]] levy or they may provide warnings to the borrower which gives them time to negotiate.
