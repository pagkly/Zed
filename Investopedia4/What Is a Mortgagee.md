[[What Is a Mortgagee]]?
## [[What Is a Mortgagee]]?

A mortgagee is a [[Lender|lender]]: specifically, an entity that lends money to a borrower for the purpose of purchasing real [[Estate|estate]]. In a [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) transaction, the lender serves as the mortgagee and the borrower is known as the [[mortgagor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgagor.asp).

### key takeaways

-   A mortgagee is an entity that lends money to a borrower (also known as a mortgagor) for the purpose of purchasing real [[Estate|estate]].
-   In order to limit its [[Risk|risk]], a mortgagee creates a priority legal interest in the value of the mortgaged property, allowing it to seize it if the mortgagor defaults on the [[Loan|loan]].

## How a Mortgagee Works

Most people take out a mortgage to [[Finance|finance]] the purchase of a residence or commercial building. In order to limit its [[Risk|risk]] in the investment, the [[Lender|lender]] in the transaction creates a priority legal interest in the value of the property, substantially lowering the probability it, the mortgagee, [[Will|will]] not be repaid in full if the borrower defaults on the [[Loan|loan]]. This is done through a [[perfected lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfected-[[Lien|lien]].asp) and title ownership.

A mortgagee represents the interests of the lending financial institution in a mortgage deal. Lending institutions can [[Offer|offer]] a variety of products to borrowers, representing a significant portion of [[Loan|loan]] assets for both individual lenders and the credit market overall.

## Mortgage Lending Products

Mortgagees can structure mortgage loans with either a fixed rate of interest or a variable rate of interest. Most mortgage loans follow an [[amortization schedule]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization_schedule.asp) that provides for steady monthly [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] to the lending institution in the form of installment payments until the [[Loan|loan]] is paid off at the end of its term. Standard fixed-rate installment mortgage loans are generally the most common type of mortgage loan issued by lenders. Adjustable rate mortgage loans can also be offered as a [[variable rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variableinterestrate.asp) mortgage product.

Lenders can also issue non-amortizing loans. However, these products are not typically [[qualified mortgages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualified-mortgage.asp) and carry much higher [[Risk|risk]]. Non-amortizing loans may have either fixed or variable rates. They are loans that defer [[Principal|principal]] cash flows for the borrower to one lump sum payment. During the duration of the [[Loan|loan]] interest payments may or may not be required. Popular types of non-amortizing mortgage loans are balloon payments loans and [[interest-only]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestonlymortgage.asp) loans.

Mortgage loans are one of the most popular types of secured loans in the credit market.

## Protections for Mortgagees

In a mortgage [[Loan|loan]], the mortgagee has rights to the real [[Estate|estate]] [[Collateral|collateral]] associated with the loan. This provides the [[Lender|lender]] with protections against [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp). However, it also requires certain provisions to be made for the seizing of collateral assets if [[Default|default]] occurs. For this reason, mortgagees include a perfected [[Lien|lien]] and integrate title rights into a mortgage lending contract.

A perfected [[Lien|lien]] is drafted by a [[Lender|lender]]’s legal counsel to allow for a mortgagee to easily obtain the real [[Estate|estate]] associated with a mortgage [[Loan|loan]] if the mortgagor defaults. A perfected lien is a [[lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp) that has been filed and recorded with the appropriate agency giving the mortgagee rights to more easily obtain the real estate [[Collateral|collateral]]. In a secured mortgage loan, the mortgagee is also the named real estate property owner on the property’s title. With the lien and property title, a mortgagee can easily obtain legal rights and institute specific procedures for vacating a property to be taken over in foreclosure.
