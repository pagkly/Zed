[[Covariance]]
## What Is [[Covariance]]?

[[Covariance]] measures the directional relationship between the returns on two [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp). A positive covariance means that asset returns move together while a negative covariance means they move inversely. Covariance is calculated by analyzing at-[[Return|return]] surprises ([standard deviations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) from the expected return) or by multiplying the [[Correlation|correlation]] between the two variables by the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of each variable.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Covariance]] is a statistical tool that is used to determine the relationship between the movement of two asset prices.
-   When two [[Stocks|stocks]] tend to move together, they are seen as having a positive [[Covariance|covariance]]; when they move inversely, the covariance is negative.
-   [[Covariance]] is a significant tool in modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory used to ascertain what securities to put in a portfolio.
-   [[Risk]] and [[Volatility|volatility]] can be reduced in a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] by pairing assets that have a negative [[Covariance|covariance]].

## Understanding [[Covariance]]

[[Covariance]] evaluates how the mean values of two variables move together. If [[Stock|stock]] A's [[Return|return]] moves higher whenever stock B's return moves higher and the same relationship is found when each stock's return decreases, then these [[Stocks|stocks]] are said to have positive covariance. In [[Finance|finance]], covariances are calculated to help [[diversify]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Diversification|diversification]].asp) [[Security|security]] [[Holdings|holdings]].

When an analyst has a set of data, a pair of x and [[Y|y]] values, [[Covariance|covariance]] can be calculated using five variables from that data. They are:

-   xi = a given x value in the data set
-   xm = the mean, or average, of the x values
-   yi = the [[Y|y]] value in the data set that corresponds with xi
-   ym = the mean, or average, of the [[Y|y]] values
-   n = the number of data points

Given this information, the formula for [[Covariance|covariance]] is: **Cov(x,[[Y|y]]) = SUM \[(xi - xm) \* (yi - ym)\] / (n - 1)**

While the [[Covariance|covariance]] does measure the directional relationship between two assets, it does not show the strength of the relationship between the two assets; the [coefficient of correlation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlationcoefficient.asp) is a more appropriate indicator of this strength.

## [[Covariance]] Applications

Covariances have significant applications in [[Finance|finance]] and [[modern portfolio theory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp). For example, in the capital asset pricing model ([CAPM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp)), which is used to calculate the expected [[Return|return]] of an asset, the [[Covariance|covariance]] between a [[Security|security]] and the market is used in the formula for one of the model's key variables, [[beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp). In the CAPM, beta measures the [[Volatility|volatility]], or systematic [[Risk|risk]], of a security in comparison to the market as a whole; it's a practical measure that draws from the covariance to gauge an investor's risk exposure specific to one security.

Meanwhile, [[portfolio theory uses covariances]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/how-[[Covariance|covariance]]-used-[[Portfolio|portfolio]]-theory.asp) to statistically reduce the overall [[Risk|risk]] of a portfolio by protecting against [[Volatility|volatility]] through covariance-informed [[Diversification|diversification]].

Possessing [[financial assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialasset.asp) with returns that have similar covariances does not provide very much [[Diversification|diversification]]; therefore, a diversified [[Portfolio|portfolio]] would likely contain a mix of financial assets that have varying covariances.

## Example of [[Covariance]] Calculation

Assume an analyst in a company has a five-quarter data set that shows quarterly gross domestic product ([GDP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp)) growth in percentages (x) and a company's new product line growth in percentages ([[Y|y]]). The data set may look like:

-   Q1: x = 2, [[Y|y]] = 10
-   Q2: x = 3, [[Y|y]] = 14
-   Q3: x = 2.7, [[Y|y]] = 12
-   Q4: x = 3.2, [[Y|y]] = 15
-   Q5: x = 4.1, [[Y|y]] = 20

The average x value equals 3, and the average [[Y|y]] value equals 14.2. [[To calculate the covariance]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/calculating-[[Covariance|covariance]].asp), the sum of the products of the xi values minus the average x value, multiplied by the yi values minus the average y values would be divided by (n-1), as follows:

Cov(x,[[Y|y]]) = ((2 - 3) x (10 - 14.2) + (3 - 3) x (14 - 14.2) + ... (4.1 - 3) x (20 - 14.2)) / 4 = (4.2 + 0 + 0.66 + 0.16 + 6.38) / 4 = 2.85

Having calculated a positive [[Covariance|covariance]] here, the analyst can say that the growth of the company's new product line has a positive relationship with quarterly GDP growth.
