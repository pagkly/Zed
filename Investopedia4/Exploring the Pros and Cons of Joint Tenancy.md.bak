[[Exploring the Pros and Cons of Joint Tenancy]]
## What Is [[Joint]] Tenancy?

The term [[Joint|joint]] tenancy refers to a legal arrangement in which two or more people own a [[property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property.asp) together, each with equal rights and obligations. Joint tenancies can be created by married and non-married couples, friends, relatives, and business associates. This legal relationship creates what is known as a right of survivorship so if one owner dies, their interest in the property is directly passed on to the surviving party(s) without having to go through [[probate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Probate|probate]].asp) or court system.

## How [[Joint]] Tenancy Works

[[Joint]] tenancy is a form of property ownership normally associated with [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp). Two or more parties come together at the same time to make a legally-binding agreement with one another through a [[deed]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deed.asp). These parties may be relatives, friends, or even business associates. For example, let's say an unmarried couple purchases a house. At the time of purchase, they opt for joint tenancy. The deed to the property [[Will|will]] name the two owners as joint tenants.

Since each party has a claim to the property, they also share the benefits. If they decide to rent out the home to another individual or if they sell the property, each party is entitled to a 50% share in the [[profits]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp). But the relationship also means they are equally responsible to pay for the property including [[mortgage payments]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-rates/payment-structure/), [[property taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/propertytax.asp), and maintenance. If one fails to live up to the financial obligations, the other party must assume responsibility.

This agreement also creates what's referred to as a right of survivorship. This means that if one person dies, the other party automatically assumes full ownership of the property. This eliminates the need for [[Probate|probate]] or the transfer of a deceased person's assets to an [[Estate|estate]]. [[Probate courts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probate-court.asp) decide the validity of a person's [[will]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Will|will]].asp) and divide the assets up appropriately among the deceased's [[beneficiaries]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp).

There is no need for the property to go through the [[Probate|probate]] system since a [[Joint|joint]] tenancy creates a right of survivorship.

Although [[Joint|joint]] tenancy is most closely associated with real [[Estate|estate]] ownership, the broader legal concept of [[joint tenancy with right of survivorship]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jtwros.asp) can apply to a range of assets, including businesses and [[brokerage accounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerageaccount.asp). The strong association with real estate exists because the term tenancy is seen as synonymous with owning or living in a home.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Joint]] tenancy is a form of property ownership normally associated with real [[Estate|estate]].
-   Each party in a [[Joint|joint]] tenancy has an equal interest in the property—the financial obligations as well as any benefits.
-   The agreement creates a right of survivorship, which means that if one party dies, their interest is automatically transferred to the surviving party(s).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of [[Joint]] Tenancy

Although [[Joint|joint]] tenancy has a number of advantages, there are some distinct disadvantages as well that should be considered before entering into the arrangement.

### Pros

As mentioned earlier, as long as one [[Joint|joint]] tenant survives, it avoids the headaches of clearing the property through an [[estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Estate|estate]].asp) via a [[Will|will]]. Typically, a person's will upon death goes through [[Probate|probate]], which is a legal process whereby the courts review a will to validate it. Typically, when a person dies, their assets cannot be accessed or claimed by the survivor until probate releases them.

The [[Probate|probate]] process also helps determine how a deceased party's [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) are distributed if the person doesn't name beneficiaries or doesn't have a [[Will|will]] in place. However, the process can easily take months to sort out. A [[Joint|joint]] tenancy avoids probate and the lengthy legal process that allows the joint tenant to take ownership of the assets immediately.

In addition to sharing the benefits of the property, all of the parties in a [[Joint|joint]] tenancy share responsibility for the property. For example, one person in the couple can’t take out a [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) [[Loan|loan]] on the property and leave their partner with the [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp). The joint tenancy applies for all of the assets as well as the debts—meaning if a loan is taken out on the property, both are responsible for the debt.

### Cons

[Divorce](https://www.investopedia.com/separation-and-divorce-4689711) or marital issues can complicate a [[Joint|joint]] tenancy. As stated earlier, all debts are owned by both parties, and neither can sell their assets that are owned jointly without consent from their partner.

Another disadvantage of [[Joint|joint]] tenancy can appear in the handling of the asset upon the death of one or more of the joint tenants. Joint tenancy gives all the rights to the survivor, so even if the deceased was hoping to pass the value of the property to designated [[heirs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Heir|heir]].asp), there is no legal obligation for the survivor to honor that request.

Pros

-   [[Joint]] tenancy avoids [[Probate|probate]] court when one of the tenants dies.
    
-   Even with no [[Will|will]] or beneficiaries named, the [[Joint|joint]] tenant inherits everything immediately.
    

Cons

-   Marital issues can complicate and delay sale of assets since both tenants must agree.
    
-   [[Joint]] tenancy gives all assets to the parter—not allowing the deceased to pass assets to heirs.
    

## [[Joint]] Tenancy vs. Tenancy in Common

One way to avoid losing control of the [[Disposition|disposition]] of the property upon death, some [[Joint|joint]] owners opt for [[tenancy in common]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jtic.asp) (JTIC) instead of a joint tenancy. Tenancy in common allows for percentage-based ownership, and [[Shares|shares]] can be traded and tenants added throughout the life of the arrangement rather than just at inception. In other words, upon death, the assets don't automatically go to the surviving partner as with joint tenancy—instead, the tenancy in common allows the assets to get distributed as stipulated in the [[Will|will]].
