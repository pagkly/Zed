[[Liquidity Preference Theory]]
## What Is [[Liquidity Preference Theory]]?

[[Liquidity Preference Theory]] is a model that suggests that an investor should demand a higher interest rate or [[Premium|premium]] on securities with long-term [[maturities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp) that carry greater [[Risk|risk]] because, all other factors being equal, investors prefer cash or other highly liquid [[Holdings|holdings]].

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Liquidity Preference Theory]] refers to money demand as measured through [[Liquidity|liquidity]].
-   John Maynard Keynes mentioned the concept in his book _The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money_ (1936), discussing the connection between interest rates and [[Supply|supply]]-demand.
-   In real-world terms, the more quickly an asset can be converted into currency, the more liquid it becomes.

## How Does [[Liquidity Preference Theory]] Work?

[[Liquidity Preference Theory]] suggests that investors demand progressively higher premiums on medium and long-term securities as opposed to short-term securities. According to the theory, which was developed by [[John Maynard Keynes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) in support of his idea that the demand for [[Liquidity|liquidity]] holds speculative power, liquid investments are easier to cash in for full value.

Cash is commonly accepted as the most [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]]. According to the [[Liquidity Preference Theory|liquidity preference theory]], interest rates on short-term securities are lower because investors are not sacrificing [[Liquidity|liquidity]] for greater time frames than medium or longer-term securities. 

## Special Considerations

Keynes introduced [[Liquidity Preference Theory]] in his book _The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money_. Keynes describes the theory in terms of three motives that determine the demand for [[Liquidity|liquidity]]:

1.  The **transactions motive** states that individuals have a preference for [[Liquidity|liquidity]] to guarantee having sufficient cash on hand for basic day-to-day needs. In other words, stakeholders have a high demand for liquidity to cover their short-term obligations, such as buying groceries and paying the rent or mortgage. Higher costs of living mean a higher demand for cash/liquidity to meet those day-to-day needs. 
2.  The **precautionary motive** relates to an individual's preference for additional [[Liquidity|liquidity]] if an unexpected problem or cost arises that requires a substantial outlay of cash. These events include unforeseen costs like house or car repairs.
3.  Stakeholders may also have a **speculative motive.** When interest rates are low, demand for cash is high and they may prefer to [[Hold|hold]] assets until interest rates rise. The speculative motive refers to an investor's reluctance to tying up investment capital for fear of missing out on a better opportunity in the future.

When higher interest rates are offered, investors give up [[Liquidity|liquidity]] in exchange for higher rates. As an example, if interest rates are rising and bond prices are falling, an investor may sell their low paying bonds and buy higher-paying bonds or [[Hold|hold]] onto the cash and wait for an even better rate of [[Return|return]].

## Example of [[Liquidity Preference Theory]]

A three-year [[Treasury note]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurynote.asp) might pay a 2% interest rate, a [10-year treasury note](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-yeartreasury.asp) might pay a 4% interest rate and a [30-year treasury](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/30-yeartreasury.asp) bond might pay a 6% interest rate. For the investor to sacrifice [[Liquidity|liquidity]], they must receive a higher rate of [[Return|return]] in exchange for agreeing to have the cash tied up for a longer period of time.
