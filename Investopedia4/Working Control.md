[[Working Control]]
## What Is [[Working Control]]?

[[Working Control|Working control]] occurs when a minority [[shareholder]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp), or group of them, has enough voting power to influence or determine corporate policy. Working control exists in corporations with widely dispersed share ownership where no single individual has a [majority interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/majorityshareholder.asp), meaning ownership of 51% or more of the [[Voting Shares|voting shares]].

In such cases, an individual shareholder with a 20% [[stake]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stakeholder.asp) in a company often controls a large enough position to acquire [[Working Control|working control]]. Other times, it requires a group of shareholders working in concert to exert power and wield influence over a company’s direction.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Working Control|Working control]] occurs when a minority shareholder, or group of them, has enough voting power to influence or determine corporate policy.
-   It exists in corporations with widely dispersed share ownership where no single individual has a majority interest—51% or more of the [[Voting Shares|voting shares]].
-   While there are no official benchmarks for defining [[Working Control|working control]], holding 20% of all outstanding [[Shares|shares]] is often considered enough.
-   Multiple minority shareholders could also unite to obtain [[Working Control|working control]] in a corporation.

## Understanding [[Working Control]]

When you buy [[Stock|stock]] in a company you become a minority shareholder. This gives you a percentage of ownership and a share of the spoils, but very little say or influence in the direction of the company. Generally, only when owning more than half of a company’s [[outstanding shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) do stakeholders get to set policy and procedures.

Minority shareholders can occasionally [[Gain|gain]] some form of control and help call the shots, however, with a much smaller stake. If there is no dominant majority (greater than 50 percent) shareholder on the [[register]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder-register.asp), owning less [[Stock|stock]] might be enough to engineer changes within a company. Usually, this can be achieved by buying up at least one-fifth of [[Shares|shares]] or joining forces with multiple minority shareholders.

[[Working Control|Working control]] isn’t always easy to acquire. In some industries, such as technology, founders [[Will|will]] sit at the helm of companies since day one and make sure they maintain control of a majority of the [[voting shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingshares.asp). Facebook Inc. ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=FB)) and Alphabet Inc. ([GOOGL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GOOGL)) [[Offer|offer]] two examples of companies structured to keep power and decision making among original owners.

Still, there are some exceptions. [[Working Control|Working control]] situations can emerge in companies operating in legacy industries that experience some turnover at the [[C-level]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-suite.asp) or [[board of directors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp) (B of D). These types of companies can become easy prey to activist investors. Wealthy [[Hedge|hedge]] funds and private [[Equity|equity]] firms [[Will|will]] stealthily buy up enough [[Shares|shares]] to obtain working control and win a place on the board. Doing so enables them to effect significant change within a company without having to go through the trouble of purchasing it outright.

[[Hedge]] funds, mutual funds, and private [[Equity|equity]] firms often obtain [[Working Control|working control]] of a [[Stock|stock]] before launching a proxy fight with the current management team. 

## [[Working Control]] Requirements

Once investors cross the necessary threshold, companies must disclose that they have [[Working Control|working control]] on their [[financial statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp). While there are no official benchmarks for defining working control, holding 20% of all outstanding [[Shares|shares]] is often considered large enough to exhibit this level of influence.

Not all [[Shares|shares]] are the same, though. Some types of units of ownership interest, such as [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp), do not carry a vote in shareholder meetings, making them much less powerful chips for wielding influence and obtaining control than others.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of [[Working Control]] 

Having [[Working Control|working control]] of [[Voting Shares|voting shares]] gives the person or group massive influence over the operational and strategic decision-making process. If that individual believes the company should pursue a project or withdraw from an existing one, he or she has the power to jumpstart those efforts alone. A leadership position on the B of D and the ability to make key operational hires in the C-suite means holding considerable sway over a company’s direction.

The addition of fresh voices and visions could potentially be viewed as a positive for companies that are stale and in need of a shake-up. [[Working Control|Working control]] can often be used to wake-up underperforming executives and engineer positive change, resulting in a more efficient [[allocation of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_allocation.asp).

A lot depends on who has [[Working Control|working control]], though. The arrival of disruptive figures to the board who are constantly at loggerheads with existing majority shareholders can create a toxic working environment, bad publicity, and maybe even the wrong decisions getting signed off.

Some parties with [[Working Control|working control]] want to exert their influence to better the company, and its shareholders' wallets, over the long haul. Others are only interested in lining their own pockets, engaging in [[asset stripping]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetstripping.asp) and questionable [[share repurchase]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharerepurchase.asp) programs to make themselves a quick buck, despite being aware that such measures [[Risk|risk]] eventually bleeding the company dry and eroding long-term value.
