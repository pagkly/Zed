[[What Is a Non-Taxable Distribution]]?
## [[What Is a Non-Taxable Distribution]]?

A non-taxable distribution is a payment to shareholders that is similar to a dividend but that represents a share of a company's capital rather than its earnings. In any case, it's not really "non-taxable." It's just not taxed until the investor sells the [[Stock|stock]] in the company that issued the distribution. Nondividend distributions reduce the basis of the stock.

[[Stock]] received from a corporate spinoff may be transferred to stockholders as a non-taxable distribution. [[Dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) paid to cash-value life insurance policyholders are considered non-taxable distributions of capital.

Non-taxable distributions also may be referred to as non-dividend distributions or [[Return|return]] of capital distributions.

### Key Takeaways

-   A non-taxable distribution may be a [[Stock|stock]] dividend, a [[Stock Split|stock split]], or a distribution from a corporate liquidation.
-   It is only taxable when you sell the [[Stock|stock]] of the corporation that issued the distribution.
-   The non-taxable distribution is reported to the IRS as a reduction in the cost basis of the [[Stock|stock]].

## Understanding the Non-Taxable Distribution

A non-taxable distribution to shareholders is not paid from the earnings or profits of a company or a mutual fund. It is a [[Return|return]] of capital, meaning that investors are getting back some of the money they invested in the company.

Non-taxable distributions can be reported in Box 3 of Form 1099-DIV.

Examples of non-taxable distributions include [[Stock|stock]] dividends, stock splits, stock rights, and distributions received from a partial or complete liquidation of a corporation.

## Not Really 'Non-Taxable'

The distribution is a non-taxable event when it is disbursed, but it [[Will|will]] be taxable when the [[Stock|stock]] is sold.

Shareholders who receive non-taxable distributions must reduce the [[cost basis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp) of their [[Stock|stock]] accordingly. When the shareholder sells the stock, the capital [[Gain|gain]] or loss that results [[Will|will]] be calculated from the adjusted basis.

For example, say an investor purchases 100 [[Shares|shares]] of a [[Stock|stock]] for $800. During the tax year, the investor receives a non-taxable distribution of $90 from the company. The cost basis [[Will|will]] be adjusted to $710, the price paid minus the distribution. The following year, the investor sells the shares for $1,000. The capital [[Gain|gain]] for tax purposes is $290, or the $200 profit plus the $90 distribution.

The amount of a non-dividend distribution is usually smaller than the investor’s basis in the [[Shares|shares]]. In the rare case in which the distribution is more than the basis, the shareholder must reduce his or her cost basis to zero and report the excess amount of the distribution as a capital [[Gain|gain]] on Schedule D.

For example, assume the investor in the example above receives a total of $890 in non-taxable dividends. The first $800 of the distribution [[Will|will]] reduce the cost basis to zero. The remaining $90 must be reported as short- or long-term capital [[Gain|gain]], depending on whether the [[Shares|shares]] were held for a year or less.

Non-taxable distributions are generally reported in Box 3 of Form 1099-DIV. [[Return]] of capital shows up under the “Non-Dividend Distributions” column on the form. The investor may receive this form from the company that paid the dividend. If not, the distribution may be reported as an [[ordinary dividend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinary-dividends.asp).

[IRS Publication 550](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-550) has all the details about reporting investment income, including non-dividend distribution income.
