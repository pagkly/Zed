[[Noncallable]]
## What Is [[Noncallable]]?

[[Noncallable]] [[Security|security]] is a financial security that cannot be redeemed early by the issuer except with the payment of a penalty. The issuer of a noncallable bond subjects itself to [[interest rate risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) because, at issuance, it locks in the interest rate it [[Will|will]] pay until the security matures. If interest rates decline, the issuer must continue paying the higher rate until the security matures.

Most treasury securities and [[municipal bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp) are [[Noncallable|noncallable]].

## Understanding Noncallables

Preferred [[Shares|shares]] and corporate bonds have [[call provisions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callprovision.asp) that are stipulated in the [[share prospectus]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp) or [[trust indenture]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust_indenture.asp) at the time of [[Security|security]] issuance. A call provision may indicate that a bond is callable or [[Noncallable|noncallable]]. [[Callable security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callable-security.asp) can be redeemed early and pays a [[Premium|premium]] to compensate the investor for the [[Risk|risk]] that they [[Will|will]] not earn any additional interest in the event that the security is redeemed prior to its maturity date. Bonds are often “called” when interest rates drop because lower interest rates mean the company can refinance its [[Debt|debt]] at a lower cost. For example, if prevailing interest rates in the economy decrease to 3%, an existing bond that pays a 4% [[coupon rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp) will represent a higher cost of borrowing for the issuing firm. To reduce its costs, the issuing firm may decide to redeem the existing bonds and reissue them at the lower interest rate. While this move is advantageous to issuers, bond investors are at a disadvantage as they are exposed to [[reinvestment risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinvestmentrisk.asp) – risk of reinvesting proceeds at a lower interest rate.

A bond may also be [[Noncallable|noncallable]] either for the duration of the bond’s life or until a predetermined period of time has passed after initial issuance. A bond that is entirely noncallable cannot be redeemed early by the issuer regardless of the level of interest rates in the market. Noncallable bondholders are protected from income loss that is caused by premature redemption. They are guaranteed regular interest or coupon payments as long as the bond has not matured, which ensures that their interest income and rate of [[Return|return]] is predictable. Bond issuers, however, are at a disadvantage since they may be stuck with paying higher interest payments on a bond and, thus, a higher [[cost of debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofdebt.asp), when interest rates have declined. As a result, noncallable bonds tend to pay investors a lower interest rate than callable bonds. However, the [[Risk|risk]] is lower to the investor, who is assured of receiving the stated interest rate for the duration of the [[Security|security]].

## Special Considerations

Some callable bonds are [[Noncallable|noncallable]] for a set period after they are first issued. This time period is called a [[call protection]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callprotection.asp) period. For example, a trust indenture may stipulate that a 20-year bond may not be called until eight years after its issue date. The call protection period ensures that bondholders continue to receive interest payments for at least eight years during which time the bonds remain noncallable. After the call protection ends, the noncallable [[Security|security]] becomes callable, and the date that an issuer may redeem its bonds is referred to as a [[first call date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calldate.asp). If the issuer redeems its bonds prior to maturity due to more attractive refinancing rates, interest payments [[Will|will]] cease to be made to bondholders.

A [[Noncallable|noncallable]] bond or [[preferred share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) that is redeemed before the maturity date or during the call protection period [[Will|will]] incur the payment of a steep penalty.
