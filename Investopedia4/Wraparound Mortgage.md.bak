[[Wraparound Mortgage]]
## What Is a [[Wraparound Mortgage]]?

A [[Wraparound Mortgage|wraparound mortgage]] is a type of junior [[Loan|loan]] which wraps or includes, the current note due on the property. The wraparound loan [[Will|will]] consist of the balance of the original loan plus an amount to cover the new [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] for the property. These mortgages are a form of secondary financing. The seller of the property receives a secured [[promissory note]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp), which is a legal IOU detailing the amount due. A wraparound mortgage is also known as a wrap loan, overriding mortgage, agreement for sale, a carry-back, or all-inclusive mortgage.

### Key Takeaways

-   Wraparound mortgages are used to refinance a property and are junior loans that include the current note on the property, plus a new [[Loan|loan]] to cover the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of the property. 
-   Wraparounds are a form of secondary and [[Seller Financing|seller financing]] where the seller holds a secured promissory note. 
-   A wraparound tends to arise when an existing mortgage cannot be paid off.
-   With a [[Wraparound Mortgage|wraparound mortgage]], a [[Lender|lender]] collects a mortgage payment from the borrower to pay the original note and provide themselves with a [[Profit Margin|profit margin]].

## How a [[Wraparound Mortgage]] Works

Frequently, a [[Wraparound Mortgage|wraparound mortgage]] is a method of [[refinancing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refinance.asp) a property or financing the purchase of another property when an existing mortgage cannot be paid off. The total amount of a wraparound mortgage includes the previous mortgage's unpaid amount plus the additional funds required by the [[Lender|lender]]. The borrower makes the larger payments on the new wraparound [[Loan|loan]], which the lender [[Will|will]] use to pay the original note plus provide themselves a [[Profit Margin|profit margin]]. Depending on the wording in the loan documents, the title may immediately transfer to the new owner or it may remain with the seller until the satisfaction of the loan.

A [[Wraparound Mortgage|wraparound mortgage]] is a form of [[Seller Financing|seller financing]] that does not involve a conventional bank mortgage, with the seller taking the place of the bank. 

Since the wraparound is a [[junior mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junior_mortgage.asp), any superior, or senior, claims [[Will|will]] have priority. In the event of [[Default|default]], the original mortgage would receive all proceeds from the liquidation of the property until it is all paid off.

Wraparound mortgages are a form of [[seller financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller-financing.asp) where Instead of applying for a conventional bank mortgage, a buyer [[Will|will]] sign a mortgage with the seller. The seller then takes the place of the bank and accepts payments from the new owner of the property. Most seller-financed loans will include a spread on the interest rate charged, giving the seller additional profit. 

## [[Wraparound Mortgage]] vs. Second Mortgage

Both wraparound mortgages and [[second mortgages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondmortgage.asp) are forms of [[Seller Financing|seller financing]]. A second mortgage is a type of subordinate mortgage made while an original mortgage is still in effect. The interest rate charged for the second mortgage tends to be higher and the amount borrowed [[Will|will]] be lower than that of the first mortgage. 

A notable difference between wraparound and second mortgages is in what happens to the balance due from the original [[Loan|loan]]. A [[Wraparound Mortgage|wraparound mortgage]] includes the original note rolled into the new mortgage payment. With a second mortgage, the original mortgage balance and the new price combine to form a new mortgage.

## Example of a [[Wraparound Mortgage]]

For example, Mr. Smith owns a house which has a mortgage balance of $50,000 at 4% interest. Mr. Smith sells the home for $80,000 to Mrs. Jones who obtains a mortgage from either Mr. Smith or another [[Lender|lender]] at 6% interest. Mrs. Jones makes payments to Mr. Smith who uses those payments to pay his original 4% mortgage. 

Mr. Smith makes a profit on both the difference between the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] and the original owed mortgage and on the spread between the two interest rates. Depending on the [[Loan|loan]] paperwork, the home's ownership may transfer to Mrs. Jones. However, if she defaults on the mortgage, the [[Lender|lender]] or a senior claimant may [[foreclose]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp) and reclaim the property.
