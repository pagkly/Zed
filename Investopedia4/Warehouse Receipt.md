[[Warehouse Receipt]]
## What Is a [[Warehouse Receipt]]?

A [[Warehouse Receipt|warehouse receipt]] is a type of documentation used in the [[futures markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresmarket.asp) to guarantee the quantity and quality of a particular [[commodity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp) being stored within an approved facility. Warehouse receipts are important because they serve as proof that the commodity is in the warehouse and that the proper documentation has been verified. Commodities need to meet specific quality standards in order to be traded as a [[Futures|futures]] contract, and the warehouse receipts play a role in verifying that the necessary requirements have been met.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Warehouse Receipt|warehouse receipt]] is used in the [[Futures|futures]] markets to guarantee the quantity and quality of a commodity being stored in a facility.
-   Exchange-approved warehouses are used to provide a secure location to store the physical commodity as well as provide inventory management.
-   The [[Warehouse Receipt|warehouse receipt]] provides the exchange with documentation that the goods authorized for sale are available for transfer to a buyer.

## Understanding a [[Warehouse Receipt]]

Warehouse [[receipts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/receipt.asp) are a part of the operational business processing involved with [[Futures|futures]] contracts for physical delivery. A [[futures contract]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp) is an obligation to buy or sell a commodity or [[Security|security]] at a predetermined price at a date in the future. Futures are [[derivatives]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) because they derive their value from the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] security or commodity. There are many types of commodity futures, including corn, wheat, oil, gold, and silver. Futures contracts are standardized, meaning they have a set quantity and are deliverable by certain dates throughout the year.

However, [[Futures|futures]] also have quality standards that must be met and warehouse receipts play a role in the inventory and delivery process of the [[Underlying|underlying]] commodity for the contract. For a commodity to be delivered, to satisfy a futures contract, there must be a [[Warehouse Receipt|warehouse receipt]] for the goods. Sometimes, instead of the physical delivery of the actual commodities backing a contract, warehouse receipts can be used to settle futures contracts. For [[precious metals]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preciousmetal.asp), warehouse receipts may also be referred to as [[vault receipts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vaultreceipt.asp).

## Commodities for Physical Delivery

[[Futures]] contracts are broadly used by all types of companies [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] and transporting various types of goods. Some of the most popular futures exchanges include the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp), [[Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cbot.asp), [[New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nymex.asp), and the [[New York Board of Trade (NYBOT)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nybot.asp). Futures exchanges are used by buyers and sellers to [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp)–or protect themselves from–the price [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) of all types of commodities. In some cases, traders may use the futures market to speculate and profit from arbitrage opportunities.

However, the majority of trades made on [[Futures|futures]] exchanges are done by commercial traders who seek to either sell or buy commodities for physical delivery. Commodities for physical delivery are used to produce and manufacture a wide range of goods that comprise a large portion of the U.S economy’s [[gross domestic product (GDP)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp). GDP is a measurement of economic growth in an economy.

[Futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Futures|futures]].asp) contracts on commodities differ from [[Plain Vanilla|plain vanilla]] options on [[Stocks|stocks]]. [[Options contracts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) give the holder the right to buy or sell the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] at a preset price or [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp). While stocks and other underlying exchange traded securities for options can be easily bought and sold electronically with electronic settlement, futures contracts require the tracking of physical inventory. Also, specific quality standards must be met for a commodity to be physically delivered as a result of a futures contract.

## Certificated [[Stock]]

The tracking of physical inventory provides for some important procedures that must be followed by commodity producers. In order for commodity producers to write contracts on their commodity inventory, they must be licensed and registered with the appropriate authorities. Commodity producers must also certificate their physical inventory through a certification process that involves inspection and authentication resulting in a certificated [[Stock|stock]] approval. [[Certificated stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificatedstock.asp) can then be used to write contracts on inventory in the [[Futures|futures]] market.

## Warehouse Receipts

Each [[Futures|futures]] exchange has specific delivery and storage requirements that must be met. For example, at the CME, exchange-approved warehouses are the only entities and locations that can deliver against a futures contract.1

Exchange-approved warehouses are used to provide a secure location to store the physical commodity. The warehouse also provides the inventory management services for the [[Futures|futures]] exchange and ensures that any commodities delivered to the warehouse meet the strict specifications, including having the proper certifications. For example, copper and gold would each have their own specific weight and quality requirements that would need to be met before the warehouse could accept a shipment from a refiner or producer.

Warehouse receipts are another operational step taken when a physical commodity is used as backing for a [[Futures|futures]] contract. A [[Warehouse Receipt|warehouse receipt]] provides the exchange with documentation that the goods authorized for sale are available and ready for transfer to a buyer. The entity selling their inventory [[Will|will]] write a futures contract to sell at a specified price.

Warehouse receipts are required with the writing of a short (or sale) commodity [[Futures|futures]] contract. The entity that takes the long (or buy) position is assured by the [[Warehouse Receipt|warehouse receipt]]. The entity with the long position contract at expiration [[Will|will]] receive the commodity inventory at the specified price.

If the buyer didn't want to take delivery of all of the commodity, for example, they could ship a partial order to where they need it (such as their store to sell it) and [[Hold|hold]] the remaining portion in the warehouse. The [[Warehouse Receipt|warehouse receipt]] would act as ownership for the commodity in storage at the exchange-approved warehouse.
