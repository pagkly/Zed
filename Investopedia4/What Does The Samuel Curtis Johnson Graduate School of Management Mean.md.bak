The school is home to roughly 100 faculty members and offers a variety of well-respected programs, including a two-year [[Master of Business Administration (MBA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mba.asp) program, an accelerated 1-year MBA, and a dedicated [[Executive MBA]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executive-mba.asp) program.

## How Cornell Johnson Works

The Cornell Johnson MBA program is known for its emphasis on providing a highly immersive experience. This is achieved through [[internships]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011316/job-or-internship-guide-college-students.asp), case studies, and visits to relevant companies. Additionally, students are required to select an area of focus relatively early in the MBA curriculum. Examples of these areas of specialization include [[investment banking]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-banking.asp), strategic operations, [[capital markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp) and asset management, and digital technology. Once chosen, students benefit from a carefully tailored curriculum of academic and hands-on experiences focused on the current [[best practices]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/best_practices.asp) and emerging challenges of that sector.

For students unable to commit to a two-year MBA, an [[Accelerated MBA]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/011415/when-mba-worth-it.asp) is also available. This one-year program is oriented toward students who already have advanced degrees in a scientific or technical discipline, such as a PhD, JD, or the [[Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/cfa-4689806) designation. This program allows students to take classes at Cornell University’s technology-oriented campus, Cornell Tech, in addition to their core MBA courses.

Overall, Cornell Johnson’s MBA program has historically performed very well on international [[B-School]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/b-school.asp) rankings. In 2019, for example, Forbes rated it as the 9th-best MBA program in the world, whereas U.S. News rated it at #15 worldwide in 2021.12
