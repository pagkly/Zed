[[Optimized Portfolio As Listed Securities (OPALS)]]
## What Is an [[Optimized Portfolio As Listed Securities (OPALS)]]?

Optimized [[Portfolio|portfolio]] as [[Listed|listed]] securities is a single-country [[Equity|equity]] index that contains fewer [[Holdings|holdings]] than the benchmarked index. Optimized portfolio as listed securities was created by [[Morgan Stanley]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/082515/how-morgan-stanley-makes-its-money-ms.asp) in 1994. It is seen as a predecessor to the popularity of exchange-traded funds.

## Understanding an [[Optimized Portfolio As Listed Securities (OPALS)]]

Optimized portfolios as [[Listed|listed]] securities are designed to track a single-country index, but they are expected to [[Outperform|outperform]] the index by containing fewer [[Holdings|holdings]]; in other words, by being optimized. The portfolios may be sold before expiration or settled by physical delivery of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Shares|shares]]. The product is designed for cross-border [[Equity|equity]] investors who cannot use [[Futures|futures]] efficiently, or cannot use futures for regulatory reasons, and who cannot justify running their own country-by-country equity operation.

## Optimized [[Portfolio]] As [[Listed]] Securities and Portfolio Optimization

[[Portfolio]] optimization is the process of selecting the best portfolio ([asset allocation](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/6-asset-allocation-strategies-work/)) out of a set of all possible portfolios being considered to achieve an objective. This process typically attempts to maximize factors such as expected [[Return|return]], while minimizing factors such as expenses, [[Volatility|volatility]] and [[Risk|risk]]. The optimal portfolio varies and is influenced by each individual investor’s return objectives and risk tolerance.

[[Portfolio]] optimization often takes place in two stages: optimizing weights of asset classes and optimizing weights of securities within the same asset class. Optimizing asset class weighting would include decisions like choosing the percentage of a portfolio placed in equities versus bonds or real [[Estate|estate]], while an example of the [[Security|security]] selection would involve selecting exactly which equities or bonds are held. Holding some of the portfolio in each class provides some [[Diversification|diversification]], and holding various specific assets within each class affords further diversification.

## Optimized [[Portfolio]] As [[Listed]] Securities Listings

Optimized portfolios as [[Listed|listed]] securities trade on the Luxembourg [[Stock]] Exchange. They are available for many of the different Morgan Stanley Capital International ([[MSCI]]) indices. The portfolios are typically purchased only by large institutional investors. They have a $100 million minimum investment, and they are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange [[Commission]], so they are generally unavailable to the majority of U.S. investors.

Optimized portfolios as [[Listed|listed]] securities are often seen as one of several predecessors to the introduction of exchange-traded funds in the United States. Optimized portfolios were introduced on the Luxembourg [[Stock]] Exchange because the exchange’s more permissive rules allowed Morgan Stanley to [[Offer|offer]] the [[Shares|shares]] to retail investors. In 1996, Morgan Stanley introduced [[World Equity Benchmark Shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/webs.asp) (WEBS). These were SEC-registered units, similar to optimized portfolios as listed securities and available to U.S. retail investors.
