[[Premium]]
## What Is a [[Premium]]?

[[Premium]] has multiple meanings in [[Finance|finance]], with the first being the total cost to buy an [[option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp). A premium is also the difference between the price paid for a [[fixed-income security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp) and the [[Security|security]]'s face amount at issue. Finally, a premium is also the specified amount of payment required periodically by an insurer to provide coverage under a given insurance plan for a defined period of time.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Premium]] can mean a number of things in [[Finance|finance]]—including the cost to buy an option.
-   [[Premium]] is also the price of a bond above its issuance price. 
-   [[Premium]] is also considered the periodic payment required for insurance coverage.

## Understanding Premiums

Premiums for options are the cost to buy an option. Options give the holder (owner) the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the [[Underlying|underlying]] financial instrument at a specified strike price. The [[Premium|premium]] for a bond reflects changes in interest rates or [[Risk|risk]] profile since the issuance date.

Premiums for insurance include the compensation the insurer receives for bearing the [[Risk|risk]] of a [[payout]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Payout|payout]].asp) should an event occur that triggers coverage. The most common types of coverage are auto, health, and homeowners insurance.

## Types of Premiums

### Option [[Premium]]

The buyer of an option has the right but not the obligation to buy (call) or sell (put) the [[Underlying|underlying]] instrument at a given strike price for a given period of time. The [[Premium|premium]] that is paid is its intrinsic value plus its [[time value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalue.asp); an option with a longer maturity always costs more than the same structure with a shorter maturity. The [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) of the market and how close the strike price is to the then-current market price also affect the premium.

Sophisticated investors sometimes sell one option (also known as [[Writing An Option|writing an option]]) and use the [[Premium|premium]] received to cover the cost of buying the [[Underlying|underlying]] instrument or another option. Buying multiple options can either increase or reduce the [[Risk|risk]] profile of the position, depending on how it is structured.

### Bond Price [[Premium]]

The concept of a bond price [[Premium|premium]] is directly related to the principle that the price of a bond is inversely related to interest rates; if a fixed-income [[Security|security]] is purchased at a premium, this means that then-current interest rates are lower than the [[coupon rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp) of the bond. The investor thus pays a premium for an investment that [[Will|will]] [[Return|return]] an amount greater than existing interest rates.

### Insurance [[Premium]]

Premiums are paid for many types of insurance, including health, homeowners, and rental insurance. A common example of an [[insurance premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-[[Premium|premium]].asp) comes from [[auto insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auto-insurance.asp). A vehicle owner can insure the value of their vehicle against loss resulting from accident, theft, fire, and other potential problems. 

The owner usually pays a fixed [[Premium|premium]] amount in exchange for the insurance company's guarantee to cover any [[economic losses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicprofit.asp) incurred under the [[Scope|scope]] of the agreement. Premiums are based on both the [[Risk|risk]] associated with the insured and the amount of coverage desired.
