[[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA)]]
## The Tax [[Equity]] and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982

The [[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA)]] is federal legislation passed in 1982 to cut the budget deficit through federal spending cuts, tax increases, and reform measures. The legislation reversed some elements of the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA)]]. Both pieces of legislation were passed early in the presidency of Ronald Reagan.

### Key Takeaways

-   The Tax [[Equity]] and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 was the biggest tax increase in U.S. history, when adjusted for inflation.
-   The legislation quickly followed and was a response to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which was the biggest tax cut in U.S. history.
-   Following the passage of ERTA, the U.S. fell into the second half of a "double dip" recession, and the U.S. budget deficit was soaring.
-   TEFRA was steered to passage by Republican Senator Bob Dole.

## Understanding the Tax [[Equity]] and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982

Adjusted for inflation, TEFRA remains the biggest tax increase in U.S. history. Ironically, it was a response to ERTA, which passed a year earlier and remains the largest tax cut in U.S. history. TEFRA modified parts of ERTA at a time of soaring [[budget deficits]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget-deficit.asp) because of falling revenue and increasing government expenditures. The U.S. was also in the middle of a severe "double dip" recession when TEFRA was passed.

Shaped by Republican Senator Robert Dole, who was then chairman of the Senate [[Finance]] Committee, the Tax [[Equity]] and Fiscal Responsibility Act was meant to reduce the growing federal deficit by closing [[loopholes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Loophole|loophole]].asp) in the tax system, introducing stricter compliance and tax-collection measures, increasing [[excise taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/excisetax.asp) on cigarettes and telephone services, and increasing corporate taxes. TEFRA also rescinded some of ERTA's reductions in personal income-tax rates that had not yet gone into effect.

## Other Elements of the Tax [[Equity]] and Fiscal Responsibility Act

TEFRA removed some of the [[tax breaks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-break.asp) businesses received under ERTA, such as [[accelerated depreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accelerateddepreciation.asp). It also instituted a 10% withholding tax on dividends and interest paid to individuals who had no certified [[tax identification numbers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-indentification-number-tin.asp). TEFRA affected a broad range of taxpayers as it modified the rules governing pension plans, life insurance companies, corporate mergers, acquisitions and redemption of [[Stock|stock]], [[safe harbor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safeharbor.asp) leases.

## Historic Tax Increase Under TEFRA

President Ronald Reagan had campaigned on tax cuts and [[Limited Government|limited government]], so many were puzzled that he would agree to sign TEFRA and [[Unwind|unwind]] some of ERTA, a significant legislative achievement. Reagan resisted any tax increases for a time, but eventually relented only when he extracted a pledge for even bigger spending cuts as part of the deal. Signing the bill into law, Reagan said he was supporting "a limited [[Loophole|loophole]]-closing tax increase" to raise more than $98 billion over three years in [[Return|return]] for spending cuts worth $280 billion during the same period.
