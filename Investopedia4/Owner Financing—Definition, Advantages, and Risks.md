[[Owner Financing—Definition, Advantages, and Risks]]
## What Is Owner Financing?

Owner financing is a transaction in which a property's seller finances the purchase directly with the person or entity buying it, either in whole or in part.

This type of arrangement can be advantageous for both [[sellers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp) and buyers because it eliminates the costs of a bank intermediary. Owner financing can create much greater [[Risk|risk]] and responsibilities for the owner, however.

### Key Takeaways

-   Owner financing is sometimes referred to as “creative financing” or “[[Seller Financing|seller financing]].”
-   Typically, this type of financing is disclosed in the advertising of a property when owner financing is an option.
-   Owner financing requires that the seller take on the [[Default Risk|default risk]] of the buyer, but owners are often more willing to negotiate than traditional lenders.
-   Owner financing can provide extra income to the seller in the form of interest.
-   Sometimes, owner financing is known to help a property sell more quickly in a buyer's market.

## Understanding Owner Financing

A buyer might be very interested in purchasing a property, but the seller won't budge from a $350,000 asking price. The buyer is willing to pay that amount and can put 20% down—$70,000 that they gained from the sale of their prior home. They would have to [[Finance|finance]] $280,000, but they can only get approved for a [[traditional mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conventionalmortgage.asp) in the amount of $250,000.

The seller might agree to [[Loan|loan]] them the $30,000 to make up the difference, or they might agree to [[Finance|finance]] the entire $280,000. In either case, the buyer would pay the seller monthly, [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) plus interest on the loan. These loans are somewhat common when the buyer and seller are family or friends or are associated in some other way outside the deal.

Owner financing is for just a short period of time in many cases until the buyer is able to refinance to pay the owner in full.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Owner Financing

Owner financing is most common in a buyer’s market. An owner can usually find a buyer more quickly and speed up the transaction by [[Offering|offering]] financing, but it requires that the seller take on the [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]] by the buyer.

The seller might require a larger [[down payment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down_payment.asp) than a mortgage [[Lender|lender]] would compensate for the [[Risk|risk]]. Down payments can range from 3% to 20% with traditional mortgage lenders, depending on the type of [[Loan|loan]]. Down payments can be 20% or more in owner-financed transactions.

On the [[Upside|upside]], these transactions can [[Offer|offer]] the seller monthly [[cash flow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) that provide a better [[Return|return]] than fixed-income investments.

Buyers typically have the greatest advantage in an owner-financed transaction. The overall terms of financing are usually much more negotiable, and a buyer saves on bank-assessed points and closing costs when they make payments directly to the seller.

## Requirements for Owner Financing

An owner-financing deal should be facilitated through a [[promissory note]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp). The promissory note outlines the terms of the arrangement, including but not limited to the interest rate, repayment schedule, and the consequences of [[Default|default]]. The owner also typically keeps the property title until all the payments have been made to protect himself against default.

Some do-it-yourself transactions can be fully managed by the owner, but assistance from an attorney is generally advisable to ensure all of the bases are covered. Paying for a title search can be beneficial as well to establish that the owner/seller is, in fact, in a position to sell the property and that they can eventually release the title in exchange for financing some portion or all of the deal.
