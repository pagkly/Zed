[[Uptick Rule]]
## What Is the [[Uptick Rule]]?

The [[Uptick Rule]] (also known as the "plus tick rule") is a rule established by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) that requires [[short sales]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp) to be conducted at a higher price than the previous trade.

Investors engage in short sales when they expect a securities price to fall. The tactic involves selling high and buying low. While [[Short Selling|short selling]] can improve market [[Liquidity|liquidity]] and pricing efficiency, it can also be used improperly to drive down the price of a [[Security|security]] or to accelerate a market decline.

### Key Takeaways

-   The SEC's [[Uptick Rule]] requires short sales to be conducted at a higher price than the previous trade.
-   There are limited exemptions to the rule.
-   A revised rule implemented in 2010 lets investors exit long positions before [[Short Selling|short selling]] is triggered. 

## Understanding the [[Uptick Rule]]

The [[Uptick Rule]] prevents sellers from accelerating the downward [[Momentum|momentum]] of a securities price already in sharp decline. By entering a short-sale order with a price above the current bid, a short seller ensures that an order is filled on an uptick.

The original rule was introduced by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] as Rule 10a-1 and implemented in 1938. The SEC eliminated the original rule in 2007, but approved an alternative rule in 2010. The rule requires trading centers to establish and enforce procedures that prevent the execution or display of a prohibited short sale.

### The Alternative [[Uptick Rule]]

The 2010 alternative [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] (Rule 201) allows investors to exit long positions before [[Short Selling|short selling]] occurs. The rule is triggered when a [[Stock|stock]] price falls at least 10% in one day. At that point, short selling is permitted if the price is above the current best bid.1 This aims to preserve investor confidence and promote market stability during periods of stress and [[Volatility|volatility]].

The rule's "duration of price test restriction" applies the rule for the remainder of the trading day and the following day. It generally applies to all [[Equity|equity]] securities [[Listed|listed]] on a national securities exchange, whether traded via the exchange or [[over the counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/over-the-countermarket.asp).

The [[Uptick Rule]] is designed to preserve investor confidence and stabilize the market during periods of stress and [[Volatility|volatility]], such as a market "panic" that sends prices plummeting.

## Exemptions to the Rule

For [[Futures|futures]], there are limited exemptions to the [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]]. These instruments can be shorted on a downtick because they are highly [[liquid]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) and have enough buyers willing to enter into a [[long position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp), ensuring that the price [[Will|will]] rarely be driven to unjustifiably low levels.

To qualify for the exemption, the [[Futures|futures]] contract must be deemed to be "owned by the seller." This means that according to the SEC, that the person "holds a [[Security|security]] futures contract to purchase it and has received notice that the position [[Will|will]] be physically settled and is irrevocably bound to receive the [[Underlying|underlying]] security.”
