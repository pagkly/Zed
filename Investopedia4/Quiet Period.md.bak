[[Quiet Period]]
## What Is a [[Quiet Period]]?

Prior to a company’s Initial Public [[Offering]] ([IPO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp)), the [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] is an SEC-mandated embargo on promotional publicity. This prohibits management teams or their marketing agents from making forecasts or expressing any opinions about the value of their company.

For publicly-traded [[Stocks|stocks]], the four weeks before the close of a business quarter is also known as a [[Quiet Period|quiet period]]. Here again, corporate insiders are forbidden to speak to the public about their business to avoid tipping certain analysts, journalists, investors, and [[Portfolio|portfolio]] managers to an unfair advantage – often to avoid the appearance of insider information, whether real or perceived.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] is a set amount of time in which a company's management and marketing teams cannot share opinions or additional information about the firm.
-   The purpose of the [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] is to preserve objectivity and avoid the appearance of a company providing insider information to select investors.
-   With an IPO, the [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] stretches from the time a company files registration paperwork with U.S. regulators through the 40 days after the [[Stock|stock]] starts trading.
-   With publicly-traded companies, the [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] is a reference to the four weeks before the end of the business quarter.

## Understanding the [[Quiet Period]]

After a company files [[registration]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/registration.asp) for newly issued securities ([[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds) with the SEC, their management team, investment bankers and lawyers go on a [[roadshow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roadshow.asp). During a series of presentations, potential institutional investors [[Will|will]] ask questions about the company to gather investment research. Management teams must not [[Offer|offer]] any new information that is not already contained in the registration statement. But it still offers some level of informational gathering.

The [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] begins when the registration statement is made effective and lasts for 40 days after the [[Stock|stock]] begins trading. Its purpose is to create a level playing field for all investors by ensuring that everyone has access to the same information at the same time.

It’s not uncommon for the SEC to delay an IPO if a [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] has been violated; interested parties take the process seriously as there’s a lot of money on the line.

The term [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] has two references in business, one relating to an initial public [[Offering|offering]] (IPO) and one to the end of the business quarter for a corporation.

## [[Quiet Period]] Violation Example

Debating the objectives of quiet periods and the SEC’s enforcement are commonplace in financial markets. When quiet periods are seen as having been violated and ultimately to have benefitted select parties, legal action is usually taken.

In a recent example, shareholders alleged impropriety regarding the [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] surrounding Facebook's IPO in 2012, arguing that certain information that should have been kept quiet may have been shared selectively, unfairly benefitting certain parties. Facebook's IPO prompted more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits accusing the social networking company and its underwriters of obscuring its weakened growth forecasts ahead of the listing. Small investors complained they were at an informational disadvantage after underwriters’ research analyst supposedly passed new and useful earnings estimates to large investors only.
