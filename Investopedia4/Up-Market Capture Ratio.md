[[Up-Market Capture Ratio]]
## What Is the [[Up-Market Capture Ratio]]

The [[Up-Market Capture Ratio|up-market capture ratio]] is the statistical measure of an investment manager's overall performance in up-markets. It is used to evaluate how well an [[investment manager]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp) performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is calculated by dividing the manager's returns by the returns of the index during the up-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

## Understanding the [[Up-Market Capture Ratio]]

An investment manager who has an up-market ratio greater than 100 has outperformed the index during the up-market. For example, a manager with an [[Up-Market Capture Ratio|up-market capture ratio]] of 120 indicates that the manager outperformed the market by 20% during the specified period. Many [[analysts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst.asp) use this simple calculation in their broader assessments of individual investment managers.

If an investment mandate calls for an investment manager to meet or exceed a [[benchmark]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) index’s rate of [[Return|return]], the [[Up-Market Capture Ratio|up-market capture ratio]] is helpful for spotting those managers who are doing so. This is important to investors who use an [[active investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activeinvesting.asp) strategy or those more considered with relative returns, rather than [[absolute returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absolutereturn.asp) (as [[Hedge|hedge]] funds often seek).

The [[Up-Market Capture Ratio|up-market capture ratio]] is just one of many indicators used by analysts to find good money managers. Because the ratio focuses on [[Upside|upside]] movements, some critics [[Offer|offer]] compelling evidence it encourages managers to “shoot for the moon,” as the metric doesn’t account for downside (losses) moves. But when combined with complementary performance indicators, the up-market capture ratio does present valuable investment insight.
