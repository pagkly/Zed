[[Dispersion Definition]]
## What Is Dispersion?

Dispersion is a statistical term that describes the size of the distribution of values expected for a particular variable and can be measured by several different statistics, such as range, variance, and [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp). In [[Finance|finance]] and investing, dispersion usually refers to the range of possible [[returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Return|return]].asp) on an investment. It can also be used to measure the [[Risk|risk]] inherent in a particular [[Security|security]] or investment [[Portfolio|portfolio]].

### Key Takeaways

-   Dispersion refers to the range of potential outcomes of investments based on historical [[Volatility|volatility]] or returns.
-   Dispersion can be measured using alpha and beta, which measure [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted returns and returns relative to a benchmark index, respectively.
-   Generally speaking, the higher the dispersion, the riskier an investment is, and vice versa.

## Understanding Dispersion

Dispersion is often interpreted as a measure of the degree of uncertainty, and thus [[risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]].asp), associated with a particular [[Security|security]] or investment [[portfolio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp).

Investors have thousands of potential [[securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) to invest in and many factors to consider in choosing where to invest. One factor high on their list of considerations is the [[Risk|risk]] profile of the investment. Dispersion is one of many statistical measures to give perspective.

Most funds [[Will|will]] address their [[Risk|risk]] profile in their fact sheets or [[prospectuses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp), which can be readily found on the internet. Information on individual [[Stocks|stocks]], meanwhile, can be found on Morningstar and similar [[Stock|stock]] [[Rating|rating]] companies.

The dispersion of [[Return|return]] on an asset shows the [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) and [[Risk|risk]] associated with holding that [[asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp). The more variable the return on an asset, the more risky or volatile it is.

For example, an asset whose historical [[Return|return]] in any given year ranges from +10% to -10% can be considered more volatile than an asset whose historical return ranges from +3% to -3% because its returns are more widely dispersed.

## Measuring Dispersion

### Beta

The primary [[Risk|risk]] measurement statistic, [[beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp), measures the dispersion of a [[Security|security]]'s [[Return|return]] relative to a particular benchmark or [[market index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp), most frequently the U.S. [[S&P 500 Index|S&P 500 index]]. A beta measure of 1.0 indicates the investment moves in unison with the benchmark.

A beta greater than 1.0 indicates the [[Security|security]] is likely to experience moves greater than the [[market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp) as a whole—a [[Stock|stock]] with a beta of 1.3 could be expected to experience moves that are 1.3x the market, meaning if the market is up 10%, the beta stock of 1.3 climbs 13%. The flip side is that if the market goes down, that security [[Will|will]] likely go down more than the market, though there are no guarantees of the magnitude of the moves.

A beta of less than 1.0 signifies a less dispersed [[Return|return]] relative to the overall market. For example, a [[Security|security]] with a beta of 0.87 [[Will|will]] likely trail the overall market—if the market is up 10%, then the investment with the lower beta would be expected to rise only 8.7%.

### Alpha

[Alpha](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp) is a statistic that measures a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s [[risk-adjusted returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskadjustedreturn.asp)—that is, how much, more or less, did the investment [[Return|return]] relative to the index or beta.

A [[Return|return]] higher than the beta indicates a positive alpha, usually attributed to the success of the [[portfolio manager]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanager.asp) or model. A negative alpha, on the other hand, indicates the lack of success of the [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] in beating the beta or, more broadly, the market.
