[[Kicker]]
## What Is a [[Kicker]]?

A [[Kicker|kicker]] is a right, [[exercisable warrant]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Warrant|warrant]].asp), or other feature that is added to a [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]] to make it more desirable to potential investors by giving the [[Debt|debt]] holder the potential option to purchase [[Shares|shares]] of the issuer.

In real [[Estate|estate]], a [[Kicker|kicker]] is an added expense that must be paid on a mortgage in order to get a [[Loan|loan]] approved. An example would be an [[Equity|equity]] stake in the receipts of a retail or rental property.

A [[Kicker|kicker]] is also called a [[sweetener]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sweetener.asp) or a wrinkle.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Kicker|kicker]], also known as a sweetener or a wrinkle, is a feature added to a [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]] that makes it more desirable to prospective lenders or investors.
-   Kickers provide investors with an extra incentive to purchase [[Debt|debt]] securities (such as a preferred share or bond) because they add to the investors' expected [[Return|return]] on investment (ROI).
-   Two popular types of [[Equity|equity]] kickers are convertible bonds and warrants to purchase [[Stocks|stocks]].
-   For investment real [[Estate|estate]] loans, a common type of [[Kicker|kicker]] is for the borrower to [[Offer|offer]] the [[Lender|lender]] a share of the total income or gross rental receipts generated from the investment property.

## How a [[Kicker]] Works

Kickers are features that are added to "get the deal done" as they are exclusively for the benefit of lenders and used to add to their expected [[return on investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) (ROI).

For example, a [[Lender|lender]] may be wary of loaning money to a [[startup company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp), which may need the money to [[Finance|finance]] early-stage operations. Without a financial track record showing steady sales growth and profits, the startup may face an uphill battle in obtaining funding. The young company may need to structure an [[Equity|equity]] deal to entice the lender, [[Offering|offering]] a [[Kicker|kicker]] of equity ownership in the company. In [[Return|return]] for loaning money to the company, the lender [[Will|will]] receive a stake in the company and a certain percentage of future profits.

## [[Equity]] Kickers

In effect, a [[Kicker|kicker]] is an extra incentive to encourage investors to purchase [[Debt|debt]] securities, such as a bond or [[preferred share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp). When a bond has an [[embedded option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/embeddedoption.asp) that may be exercised by the bondholder to purchase [[Equity|equity]] at the issuing firm at a discount price, the option is said to be a kicker. An investor [[Will|will]] be incentivized to purchase a bond with a kicker as this allows the investor to participate in any increase in the value of equity ownership.

Two common types of [[Equity|equity]] kickers are a [[convertible feature]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertiblebond.asp) on some bonds that allows the bonds to be exchanged for [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock|stock]], and [[warrants]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Warrant|warrant]].asp) to purchase [[Stocks|stocks]] that are sold in combination with a new bond issue.

[[Equity]] kickers are often used for [[leveraged buyouts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp) (LBOs), management buyouts (MBOs), and equity recapitalizations since they are considered too risky for traditional financing offered by senior, secured lenders.

A company that adds a [[Kicker|kicker]] (for example, a [[rights offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp)) to a bond issue is only doing so to get the entire issue into the hands of investors. The kicker may or may not actually be usable at any time during the life of the bond. Often a certain breakpoint must be reached, such as a [[Stock|stock]] price above a certain level, before the kicker has any real value.

For example, a bondholder that has the right to purchase [[Shares|shares]] in the company for $20 per share, [[Will|will]] only exercise this right if the shares are trading above $20. Otherwise, there’s no financial advantage to purchasing the shares.

## Real [[Estate]] Kickers

In real [[Estate|estate]] loans, a [[Lender|lender]] may be offered, in addition to interest on the [[Loan|loan]], a share in the total income or [[gross rental receipts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-receipts.asp) that [[Will|will]] be generated from the investment property being financed, if the income exceeds a specified amount. This benefit may be offered by the borrower or demanded by the lender to sweeten the loan deal.

If the borrower is unable to make a large down payment on the property or there is some circumstance that makes the transaction a credit [[Risk|risk]], the [[Lender|lender]] may require some type of [[Equity|equity]] [[Kicker|kicker]] or percentage ownership in the property. For example, the lender may agree to a real [[Estate|estate]] investment [[Loan|loan]] provided they receive a percentage of the sales proceeds after the borrower renovates the property and resells it at a higher price.

## Special Considerations

The term [[Kicker|kicker]] should not be confused with the term [[kickback]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kickback.asp), which is an illegal payment given as compensation for preferential treatment. In real [[Estate|estate]] transactions, individuals and companies that violate the prohibition against kickbacks can face civil and criminal [[Liability|liability]]. From a legal viewpoint, all settlement costs have to be disclosed in consumer loans as part of the [[Finance|finance]] charges.

Congress enacted the [[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-[[Estate|estate]]-settlement-procedures-act-respa.asp) (RESPA), which became effective in June 1975, to protect consumers from abusive settlement practices, such as kickbacks. RESPA requires lenders, mortgage brokers, or servicers of home loans to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and costs of the real estate settlement process.1
