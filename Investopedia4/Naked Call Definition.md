[[Naked Call Definition]]
## What Is a Naked Call?

A naked call is an options strategy in which an investor [[writes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp) (sells) [[call options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on the open market without owning the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]].

This strategy, sometimes referred to as an uncovered call or an unhedged short call, stands in contrast to a [[covered call]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp) strategy, where the investor owns the [[underlying security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-[[Security|security]].asp) on which the call options are written. A naked call can be compared with a naked put.

### Key Takeaways

-   A naked call is when a call option is sold by itself (uncovered) without any offsetting positions.
-   When call options are sold, the seller benefits as the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] goes down in price.
-   A naked call has limited [[Upside|upside]] profit potential and, in theory, unlimited loss potential.
-   A naked call's breakeven point for the writer is its strike price plus the [[Premium|premium]] received.

## Understanding Naked Calls

A naked call gives an investor the ability to generate [[premium income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]]-income.asp) without directly selling the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]]. Essentially, the [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp) received is the sole motive for writing an uncovered call option.

It is inherently risky as there is limited [[upside]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Upside|upside]].asp) profit potential and, in theory, unlimited downside loss potential. In fact, the maximum [[Gain|gain]] is the [[Premium|premium]] that the option writer receives upfront, which is usually credited to their account. So, the goal for the writer is to have the option [[expire]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp) worthless.

The maximum loss, however, is theoretically unlimited because there is no cap on how high the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] can rise. However, in more practical terms, the seller of the options [[Will|will]] likely buy them back well before the price of the underlying rises too far above the [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp), based on their [[Risk|risk]] tolerance and [[stop-loss]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) settings.

[Margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) requirements, understandably, tend to be quite steep given the unlimited [[Risk|risk]] potential of this strategy.

A seller of call options, therefore, wants the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] to fall, so that they can collect the full [[Premium|premium]] if the option expires worthless. But, if the price of the underlying security instead rises, they may end up having to sell the [[Stock|stock]] at a price far below the market price because the option buyer may decide to [[exercise]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp) their right to purchase the security—that is, they would be [[assigned]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assignment.asp) to sell the stock.

## Special Considerations

The [[breakeven point]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakevenpoint.asp) for the writer is calculated by adding the option [[Premium|premium]] received to the strike price of the call that has been sold.

A rise in [[implied volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp) is not desirable to the writer as the probability of the option being [[in the money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp) (ITM), and thus being exercised, also increases. Since the option writer wants the naked call to expire [[out of the money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp) (OTM), the passage of time, or time decay, [[Will|will]] have a positive impact on this strategy.

As a result of the [[Risk|risk]] involved, only experienced investors who strongly believe that the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] [[Will|will]] fall or remain flat should undertake this advanced strategy. The margin requirements are often very high for this strategy due to the propensity for open-ended losses, and the investor may be forced to purchase [[Shares|shares]] on the [[open market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp) prior to expiration if margin thresholds are breached.

The [[Upside|upside]] to the strategy is that the investor could receive income in the form of premiums without putting up a lot of initial [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp).

## Using Naked Calls

Again, there is a significant [[Risk|risk]] of loss with writing [[uncovered]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uncovered-option.asp) calls. However, investors who strongly believe the price for the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]], usually a [[Stock|stock]], [[Will|will]] fall or stay the same can write call options to earn the [[Premium|premium]]. If the stock stays below the strike price between the time the options are written and their expiration date, then the options writer keeps the entire premium minus [[commissions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Commission|commission]].asp).

Should, on the other hand, the price of the [[Stock|stock]] rise above the strike price by the options expiration date, then the buyer of the options can demand the seller to deliver [[Shares|shares]] of the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock. The options seller [[Will|will]] then have to go into the open market and buy those shares at the [[market price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) to sell them to the options buyer at the options strike price. 

If, for example, the strike price is $60 and the open market price for the [[Stock|stock]] is $65 at the time the options contract is exercised, the options seller [[Will|will]] incur a loss of $5 per share of stock less the [[Premium|premium]] received.

### Example

The [[Premium|premium]] collected [[Will|will]] somewhat offset the loss on the [[Stock|stock]] but the potential loss can still be very large. For example, let's say an investor thought that the strong [[bull]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) run for Amazon.com was over when it finally leveled out in March 2017 near $852 per share.

The investor wrote a call option with a strike price of $865 and an expiration in May 2017. However, after a short pause, the [[Stock|stock]] resumed its [[rally]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Rally|rally]].asp) and by the mid-May expiration, the stock reached $966.

The potential [[Liability|liability]] was the [exercise price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp) of $966 minus the strike price of $865, which resulted in $101 per share. This is offset by whatever [[Premium|premium]] was collected at the start.
