Form 1040-X: Amended U.S. Individual Income [[Tax Return]]
## What Is Form 1040-X: Amended U.S. Individual Income [[Tax Return]]?

Form 1040-X is issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to taxpayers who need to amend their prior-year tax returns for any reason.

A 1040-X form is necessary for an amended [[Tax Return|tax return]] that would change a filer's tax calculations, such as changes to filing status, number of dependents, or any other material corrections to income credits or deductions. However, it is important to avoid using Form 1040-X for simple mathematical errors in your tax [[Return|return]], as the IRS [[Will|will]] correct any in your return on your behalf.1

### Key Takeaways

-   The form must be filed within three years after the original [[Return|return]] was filed or within two years after the tax was paid, whichever is later.
-   Form 1040-X should be used to correct material changes, and not to fix minor mathematical errors or mistakes.
-   Anyone who files a 1040-X form may also need to amend their state [[Tax Return|tax return]].

## Special Considerations When Filing Form 1040-X

The IRS provides the following tips to taxpayers about Form 1040-X:

-   Wait for the first refund. If your original [[Tax Return|tax return]] included a refund, you should wait until you receive it before filing Form 1040-X. The IRS [[Will|will]] issue a separate, second refund if it is warranted, so you are free to cash the first check.
-   File a 1040-X form within the three-year amendment time period. If your change [[Will|will]] affect your refund amount, you must file the form within three years from the date of your original [[Tax Return|tax return]] or within two years from the date of paying the tax amount, whichever is later. Any returns filed early will be considered filed on the official due date of [[Tax Season|tax season]], generally April 15 of the calendar year.2 1
