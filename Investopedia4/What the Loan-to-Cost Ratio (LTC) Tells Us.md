[[What the Loan-to-Cost Ratio (LTC) Tells Us]]
## What Is the [[Loan]]-To-Cost Ratio (LTC)?

The [[Loan|loan]]-to-cost (LTC) ratio is a metric used in [[commercial real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialrealestate.asp) construction to compare the financing of a project (as offered by a loan) with the cost of building the project. The LTC ratio allows commercial real [[Estate|estate]] lenders to determine the [[Risk|risk]] of [[Offering|offering]] a [[construction loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/construction-loan.asp). It also allows developers to understand the amount of [[Equity|equity]] they retain during a construction project. Similar to the LTC ratio, the [[loan-to-value (LTV) ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp) also compares the [[Construction Loan|construction loan]] amount but with the fair-market value of the project after completion.

## The Formula for LTC Is

[[Loan]] to Cost\=Loan AmountConstruction Cost\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Loan to Cost} = \\frac{ \\text{Loan Amount} }{ \\text{Construction Cost} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Loan]]-to-cost (LTC) compares the financing amount of a commercial real [[Estate|estate]] project to its cost.
-    LTC is calculated as the [[Loan|loan]] amount divided by the construction cost. 
-   Meanwhile, [[Loan|loan]]-to-value (LTV) compares the loan amount to the expected market value of the completed project. 
-   A higher LTC means the project is riskier for lenders, where most lenders [[Will|will]] only [[Finance|finance]] a project with an LTC of up to 80%.

## What Does the [[Loan]]-To-Cost Ratio Tell You?

The LTC ratio is used to calculate the percentage of a [[Loan|loan]] or the amount that a [[Lender|lender]] is willing to provide to [[Finance|finance]] a project based on the hard cost of the construction budget. After the construction has been completed, the entire project [[Will|will]] have a new value. For this reason, the LTC ratio and the LTV ratios are used side by side in commercial real [[Estate|estate]] construction.

The LTC ratio helps to delineate the [[Risk|risk]] or risk level of providing financing for a construction project. Ultimately, a higher LTC ratio means that it is a riskier venture for lenders. Most lenders provide loans that [[Finance|finance]] only a certain percentage of a project. In general, most lenders finance up to 80% of a project. Some lenders finance a greater percentage, but this typically involves a significantly higher interest rate.

While the LTC ratio is a mitigating factor for lenders that are considering the provision of a [[Loan|loan]], they must also consider other factors. [[Lenders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) [[Will|will]] also take into account the location and value of the property on which the project is being built, the credibility and experience of builders, and the borrowers' credit record and loan history as well.

## Example of How to Use LTC

As a hypothetical example, let's assume that the hard construction costs of a commercial real [[Estate|estate]] project are $200,000. To ensure that the borrower has some [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) at stake in the project, the [[Lender|lender]] provides a $160,000 [[Loan|loan]]. This keeps the project slightly more balanced and encourages the borrower to see the project through its completion. The LTC ratio on this project would be calculated as $160,000 / $200,000 = 80%.

## The Difference Between [[Loan]]-to-Cost and Loan-to-Value Ratio

Closely related to LTC is the [[Loan|loan]]-to-value ratio, but it is slightly different. The LTV ratio compares the total loan given for a project against the _value_ of the project after completion (rather than to its cost of construction). Considering the above example, let us assume that the future value of the project, once completed, is double the hard construction costs, or $200,000. If the total loan given for the project, after completion, is $320,000, the LTV ratio for this project would also be 80% or $320,000 / $400,000.
