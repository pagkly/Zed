[[Unsuitable Investment (Unsuitability) Definition]]
## What is an Unsuitable Investment (Unsuitability)?

An unsuitable investment is when an investment— such as a [[Stock|stock]] or bond—does not meet the [[objectives]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentobjective.asp) and means of an investor. The investment _strategy_ may also be unsuitable. For example, the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[asset mix]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-mix.asp) could be wrong, or the investments purchased may be too aggressive or too low-[[Risk|risk]] for what the client needs or wants. 

In most parts of the world, financial professionals have a duty to take steps that ensure an investment is suitable for a client. In the United States, these rules are enforced by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp) (FINRA). Suitability is not the same as a [[fiduciary]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Fiduciary|fiduciary]].asp) responsibility.1  

## Key Takeaways

-   _An unsuitable investment is one that does not serve an investors goals and needs as well as it could._ 
-   _Financial professionals have a general duty to [[Offer|offer]] investments that are suitable to a customer’s needs._
-   _Even those who are not strictly bound by a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary]] duty are expected to avoid [[Offering|offering]] unsuitable investments._

## Understanding an Unsuitable Investment (Unsuitability)

Unsuitable investments vary between market participants. No investment, other than outright scams, are inherently suitable or unsuitable. [[Suitability]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/suitable.asp) depends on the investor's situation and [[Will|will]] vary between investors based on their characteristics and goals. 

In order to ensure that suitable investments are offered, FINRA rules require investment firms to seek information about a customer’s age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience; investment time horizon, [[Liquidity|liquidity]] needs, and [[Risk|risk]] tolerance.1 Customers are not required to provide this information, so there is some flexibility if they do not. Having this information helps firms avoid [[Offering|offering]] unsuitable investments to a customer. 

For example, for an 85-year-old widow living on fixed income, speculative investments such as [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), [[Futures|futures]], and penny [[Stocks|stocks]] may be unsuitable because the widow has a low-[[Risk|risk]] tolerance. She is using the capital in her investments accounts, along with the returns, to live. She, and her [[investment advisor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentadvisor.asp), would likely be unwilling to put her capital at excessive risk as there is minimal time left on her [[investment horizon]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment_horizon.asp) to recoup losses should they occur.

On the other hand, a person in their twenties or thirties may be willing to take on more [[Risk|risk]]. They are still working and do not yet require their investments to live off. More risk could result in higher returns over the long-run, and the longer investment horizon means they have time to recoup any short-term losses which may occur. Very low-risk investments may be unsuitable for this investor.

Age is not the only factor when determining which investments are unsuitable. [[Income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp), expected future income, financial knowledge, lifestyle, and personal preferences are a few of the other factors that must also be considered. For example, some people just prefer to play it safe, while others are [[Risk|risk]]-takers. 

The sleep test is a simple concept that helps in this regard: if an investor can't sleep because of their investments, something is wrong. Alter the [[Risk|risk]] level until comfortable. Risk is then combined and counterbalanced with the other factors to find suitable investments or to create the proper investment strategy.

## [[Fiduciary]] Responsibility

Suitability and unsuitability are not the same as [[Fiduciary|fiduciary]] responsibility. They are essentially different levels of client care, with fiduciary responsibility being the stricter protocol. A fee-based investment advisor has a fiduciary responsibility to find investments and investment strategies that are suitable for their client. A [[commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Commission|commission]].asp)\-based broker, maybe that you get on the phone at your broker's call center, typically doesn't have a fiduciary responsibility to a client, but they [[Will|will]] still seek out suitable investments.
