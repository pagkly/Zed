[[Mode Definition]]
## What Is the Mode?

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all. Other popular measures of central tendency include the mean, or the average of a set, and the [[median]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp), the middle value in a set.

The mode can be the same value as the mean and/or median, but this is usually not the case.

## Understanding the Mode

In statistics, data can be distributed in various ways. The most often cited distribution is the classic [[normal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp) (bell-curve) distribution. In this, and some other distributions, the mean (average) value falls at the mid-point, which is also the peak frequency of observed values. For such a distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same value. This means that this value is the average value, the middle value, also the modeâ€”the most frequently occurring value in the data.

Mode is most useful as a measure of central tendency when examining categorical data, such as models of cars or flavors of soda, for which a mathematical average median value based on ordering can not be calculated.

### Key Takeaways

-   In statistics, the mode is the most commonly observed value in a set of data.
-   For the [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]], the mode is also the same value as the mean and median.
-   In many cases, the modal value [[Will|will]] differ from the average value in the data.

## Examples of the Mode

For example, in the following list of numbers, 16 is the mode since it appears more times in the set than any other number:

-   3, 3, 6, 9, **16, 16, 16**, 27, 27, 37, 48

A set of numbers can have more than one mode (this is known as _bimodal_ if there are two modes) if there are multiple numbers that occur with equal frequency, and more times than the others in the set.

-   **3, 3, 3**, 9, **16, 16, 16**, 27, 37, 48

In the above example, both the number 3 and the number 16 are modes as they each occur three times and no other number occurs more often.

If no number in a set of numbers occurs more than once, that set has no mode:

-   3, 6, 9, 16, 27, 37, 48

A set of numbers with two modes is **bimodal**, a set of numbers with three modes is **trimodal**, and any set of numbers with more than one mode is **multimodal**.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Mode

### Advantages:

-   The mode is easy to understand and calculate.
-   The mode is not affected by extreme values.
-   The mode is easy to identify in a data set and in a discrete [[frequency distribution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frequencydistribution.asp).
-   The mode is useful for qualitative data.
-   The mode can be computed in an open-ended frequency table.
-   The mode can be located graphically.

### Disadvantages:

-   The mode is not defined when there are no repeats in a data set.
-   The mode is not based on all values.
-   The mode is unstable when the data consist of a small number of values.
-   Sometimes data have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.

### Fast Fact

When scientists or statisticians talk about the modal observation, they are referring to the most common observation.
