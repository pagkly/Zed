## What Is a [[Synthetic]] Put?

A [[Synthetic|synthetic]] put is an options strategy that combines a [[short]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) [[Stock|stock]] position with a [[long call option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on that same stock to mimic a [[long put option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long_put.asp). It is also called a synthetic [[Long Put|long put]]. Essentially, an investor who has a short position in a stock purchases an [[at-the-money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp) call option on that same stock. This action is taken to protect against appreciation in the stock's price. A synthetic put is also known as a married call or protective call. 

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Synthetic|synthetic]] put is an options strategy that combines a short [[Stock|stock]] position with a long call option on that same stock to mimic a [[Long Put|long put]] option.
-   [[Synthetic]] put is a strategy that investors can utilize when they have a bearish bet on a [[Stock|stock]] and are concerned about potential near-term strength in that stock.
-   A [[Synthetic|synthetic]] put's goal is to profit from the anticipated decline in the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]]'s price, which is why it is often called a synthetic [[Long Put|long put]].

## Understanding [[Synthetic]] Puts

The [[Synthetic|synthetic]] put is a strategy that investors can utilize when they have a [[bearish]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear.asp) bet on a [[Stock|stock]] and are concerned about potential near-term strength in that stock. It is similar to an insurance policy except that the investor wants the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock to fall, not rise. The strategy combines the [[short sale]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp) of a [[Security|security]] with a long-call position on the same security.

A [[Synthetic|synthetic]] put mitigates the [[Risk|risk]] that the [[Underlying|underlying]] price [[Will|will]] increase. It does not, however, deal with other dangers, which may leave the investor exposed. Because it involves a short position in the underlying [[Stock|stock]], it carries with it all the associated risks of an adverse, or up-market, move. Risks include fees, margin interest, and the possibility of having to pay [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) to the investor from whom the [[Shares|shares]] were borrowed to sell short. 

Institutional investors can use [[Synthetic|synthetic]] puts to disguise their trading bias, be it bullish or bearish, on specific securities. However, for most investors, synthetic puts are best suited for use as an insurance policy. An increase in [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/strangle-strategy.asp) would be beneficial to this strategy while [[time decay]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedecay.asp) would impact it negatively.

Both a simple short position and a [[Synthetic|synthetic]] put have their maximum profit if the [[Stock|stock]]'s value falls to zero. However, any benefit from the synthetic put must be reduced by the price, or [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-[[Premium|premium]].asp), which the investor paid for the [[call option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp).

The [[Synthetic|synthetic]] put strategy can place a practical ceiling, or cap, on the price of the [[Stock|stock]] for a 'fee', the options [[Premium|premium]]. The cap limits any [[upside]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Upside|upside]].asp) [[Risk|risk]] for the investor. The risk is limited to the difference between the price at which the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock was shorted and the option's [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) and any commissions. Put another way, at the time of the purchase of the option, if the price at which the investor shorted the stock was equal to the strike price, the loss for the strategy would be the premiums paid for the option.

-   **Maximum [[Gain]] = Short sale price - Lowest [[Stock|stock]] price (ZERO) - Premiums**
-   **Maximum Loss = Short sale price - Long Call Strike price - Premiums**
-   **Breakeven Point = Short sale price - Premiums**

## When to Use a [[Synthetic]] Put

Rather than a profit-making strategy, a [[Synthetic|synthetic]] put is a capital-preserving strategy. Indeed, the cost of the call portion of the approach becomes a built-in cost. The [[option's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) price reduces the profitability of the method, assuming the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] moves in the desired direction lower lower. Therefore, investors should use a synthetic put as an insurance policy against near-term strength in an otherwise bearish stock, or as a protection against an unforeseen price explosion higher. 

Newer investors may benefit from knowing that their losses in the [[Stock|stock]] market are limited. This safety net can give them confidence as they learn more about different investing strategies. Of course, any protection [[Will|will]] come at a cost, which includes the price of the option, [[commissions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Commission|commission]].asp), and possibly other fees.
