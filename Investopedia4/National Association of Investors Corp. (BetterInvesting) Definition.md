## NAIC Core Principles

The National Association of Investors Corp. stresses four principles for successful, long-term investing:

-   Invest regularly, regardless of market conditions;
-   Reinvest all earnings;
-   Invest in [[growth companies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthcompany.asp) (and growth mutual funds); and
-   Diversify to reduce [[Risk|risk]].

The heart of the National Association of Investors Corp. Investment approach to investing is the third principle — investing in growth companies.

The primary tool NAIC uses to evaluate common [[Stocks|stocks]] is a two-page form with a semi-log graph on the front called the [[Stock]] Selection Guide (SSG). The SSG dates to the founding of the organization and was created by George A. Nicholson. The SSG displays a company's 10-year sales and earnings per share history, pretax profit margins and [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]]; five-year annual high and low price-earnings ratios and other important information meant to answer two questions:

1.  Is this a well-managed company?
2.  Is the [[Stock|stock]] selling at a reasonable price?

The second principle was added and emphasized in the 1980s and '90s.
