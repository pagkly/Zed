Diluted Earnings per Share (Diluted EPS): What You Should Know
## What Is Diluted Earnings per Share (Diluted EPS)?

Diluted EPS is a calculation used to gauge the quality of a company's [[Earnings Per Share (EPS)|earnings per share (EPS)]] if all convertible securities were exercised. Convertible securities are all outstanding [[convertible preferred shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Stocks|stocks]]/05/052705.asp), [[convertible debentures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertibledebenture.asp), [[Stock|stock]] options, and [[warrants]](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/warrants-risky-but-high-[[Return|return]]-investment-tool/). The diluted EPS [[Will|will]] usually be lower than the simple or basic EPS but in the rare case that there are anti-dilutive securities it may be higher. In this case only the basic EPS is reported in the financial statements.

### Key Takeaways

-   Diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) calculates a company’s earnings per share if all convertible securities were converted. 
-   Dilutive securities aren’t [[Common Stock|common stock]], but instead securities that can be converted to common [[Stock|stock]]. 
-   Converting these securities decreases EPS, thus, diluted EPS tends to always be lower than EPS. 
-   Dilutive EPS is considered a conservative metric because it indicates a worst-case scenario in terms of EPS.

## What Diluted Earnings per Share (Diluted EPS) Can Tell You

Diluted EPS considers what would happen if dilutive securities were exercised. Dilutive securities are securities that are not [[Common Stock|common stock]] but can be converted to common [[Stock|stock]] if the holder exercises that option. If converted, dilutive securities effectively increase the [[Weighted|weighted]] number of [[Shares|shares]] outstanding, which decreases EPS.

### EPS Significance

Earnings per share, the value of earnings per share of outstanding [[Common Stock|common stock]], is a very important measure to assess a company's financial health. When reporting financial results, revenue and EPS are the two most commonly assessed metrics.

EPS is reported on a company's income statement, and only public companies are required to report it. In their earnings reports, companies report both primary and diluted EPS, but the focus is generally on the more conservative diluted EPS measure. Dilutive EPS is considered a conservative metric because it indicates a worst-case scenario in terms of EPS.

It is unlikely that everyone holding options, warrants, convertible preferred [[Shares|shares]], etc. would convert their shares simultaneously. However, if things go well, there is a good chance that all options and [[convertibles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertibles.asp) [[Will|will]] be converted into [[common stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp).

A large difference between a company's basic EPS and diluted EPS can indicate high potential [[dilution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp) for the company's [[Shares|shares]], an unappealing attribute according to most analysts and investors. For example, company A has $9 billion outstanding shares. There is a $0.10 difference between its basic EPS and diluted EPS. While $0.10 seems insignificant, it equates to $900 million in value not available to investors.

## Example of Diluted Earnings per Share

Convertible [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], [[Stock|stock]] options, and convertible bonds are common types of dilutive securities. Convertible preferred stock is a preferred share that can be converted to a common share at any time. Stock options, a common employee benefit, [[Grant|grant]] the buyer the right to purchase [[Common Stock|common stock]] at a set price at a set time.

Convertible bonds are similar to convertible [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] as they are converted to common [[Shares|shares]] at the prices and times specified in their contracts. All of these securities, if exercised, would increase the number of shares outstanding and decrease EPS.
