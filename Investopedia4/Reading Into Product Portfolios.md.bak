[[Reading Into Product Portfolios]]
## What Is a Product [[Portfolio]]?

A product [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is the collection of all the products or services offered by a company. Product portfolio analysis can provide nuanced views on a [[Stock|stock]] type, company growth prospects, [[Profit Margin|profit margin]] drivers, income contributions, market leadership, and operational [[Risk|risk]]. This is essential for investors conducting [[Equity|equity]] research by investors or analysts supporting internal corporate financial planning.

## Understanding Product Portfolios

Product [[portfolios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp) are an important element of financial analysis because they provide context and granularity to a firm and its primary operations. Investors can distinguish between long-term value [[Stocks|stocks]] and [[short-term]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortterm.asp) growth opportunities. Portfolio analysis of a firm's product offerings also allows investors to nail down specific drivers of financial performance, which is necessary for effective modeling.

The various components of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] also face different [[Market Dynamics|market dynamics]] and can contribute inconsistently to the [[bottom line]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottomline.asp). A firm's market share can vary among the parts of its [[Offering|offering]], with more dominant products generally requiring different strategies than high-growth portions of the portfolio. A shifting sales mix can have significant consequences for the bottom line when margins vary across the portfolio.

Companies often re-brand or restructure underperforming and unprofitable products, a strategy that requires [[Portfolio|portfolio]] analysis. Products that contribute the most income are generally the most important for short-term financial analysis, and alterations to these flagship elements of the portfolio impact performance more substantially.

Apple, Inc., is known for [[Offering|offering]] several electronic devices, but the iPhone is the most important driver of top-line and bottom-line results. The smartphone contributed over 62% of total company sales as of June 2018, meaning its performance is more meaningful than that of the laptops, the iPad or the App Store.

### Key Takeaways

-   A product [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is the menu of goods or services that a firm producer and offers for sale.
-   Analysis of product portfolios can give deep and nuanced insight into the workings of a company and its earnings potential.
-   Product portfolios [[Will|will]] tend to be different for mature versus younger growth companies.

## Product Portfolios and Mature Companies

Mature companies often have diversified product portfolios. Internal product development and acquisitions contribute to [[Portfolio|portfolio]] size over time, and larger enterprises have the infrastructure to support the marketing of a broader [[Offering|offering]]. Geographic expansion can also augment a product portfolio, with products varying in popularity among cities or countries.

[[Diversification]] tends to limit growth potential while reducing downside [[Risk|risk]], so mature firms tend to exhibit less operational [[Volatility|volatility]]. This reduces the amount of [[Speculation|speculation]] in [[Equity|equity]] valuation. The Proctor & Gamble Company is an example of such a company, with 65 different, well-known personal and household goods brands including Bounty, Crest, and Tide.

## Product Portfolios and Growth Companies

Younger firms with small portfolios are more exposed to the performance of their main products, which can lead to greater operational [[Volatility|volatility]]. More [[Risk|risk]] and higher growth potential lead to more speculative [[Equity|equity]] valuation. The various components in a product [[Portfolio|portfolio]] often have disparate margins because they have different price dynamics, production costs or marketing demands.
