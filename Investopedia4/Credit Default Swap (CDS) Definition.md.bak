## What is a Credit [[Default]] [[Swap]] (CDS)?

A credit [[Default|default]] [[Swap|swap]] (CDS) is a financial [[derivative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) or contract that allows an investor to "swap" or offset his or her [[credit risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) with that of another investor. For example, if a [[Lender|lender]] is worried that a borrower is going to [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on a [[Loan|loan]], the lender could use a CDS to offset or swap that [[Risk|risk]]. To swap the risk of default, the lender buys a CDS from another investor who agrees to reimburse the lender in the case the borrower defaults. Most CDS [[Will|will]] require an ongoing [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp) payment to maintain the contract, which is like an insurance policy.

A credit [[Default|default]] [[Swap|swap]] is the most common form of [credit derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditderivative.asp) and may involve [municipal bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp), [[emerging market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp) bonds, [mortgage-backed securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp) or [corporate bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp).

-   Credit [[Default|default]] swaps, or CDS, are credit [[Derivative|derivative]] contracts that enable investors to [[Swap|swap]] credit [[Risk|risk]] on a company, country, or other entity with another [[Counterparty|counterparty]].
-   Credit [[Default|default]] swaps are the most common type of OTC credit derivatives and are often used to transfer credit exposure on fixed income products in order to [[Hedge|hedge]] [[Risk|risk]].
-   Credit [[Default|default]] swaps are customized between the two counterparties involved, which makes them opaque, illiquid, and hard to track for regulators

## Credit [[Default]] Swaps Explained

A credit [[Default|default]] [[Swap|swap]] is designed to transfer the [credit exposure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-exposure.asp) of [fixed income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) products between two or more parties. In a CDS, the buyer of the swap makes payments to the swap's [seller](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp) until the [maturity date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp) of a contract. In [[Return|return]], the seller agrees that – in the event that the [debt issuer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]]-issue.asp) (borrower) defaults or experiences another [credit event](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/credit-event.asp) – the seller [[Will|will]] pay the buyer the [[Security|security]]'s value as well as all [interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp) payments that would have been paid between that time and the [security's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) maturity date.

In the CDS world, a credit event is a trigger that causes the buyer of protection to terminate and settle the contract. Credit events are agreed upon when the trade is entered into and are part of the contract. The majority of single-name CDSs are traded with the following credit events as triggers: reference entity bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligation acceleration, [repudiation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Repudiation|repudiation]].asp), and [moratorium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moratorium.asp). A credit [[Default|default]] [[Swap|swap]] is a type of credit [[Derivative|derivative]] contract.

Bonds and other [[Debt|debt]] securities have [risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]].asp) that the borrower [[Will|will]] not repay the debt or its interest. Because [debt securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtsecurity.asp) will often have lengthy [terms to maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termtomaturity.asp), as much as 30 years, it is difficult for the investor to make reliable estimates about that risk over the entire life of the instrument.

Credit [[Default|default]] swaps have become an extremely popular way to manage this kind of [[Risk|risk]]. The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency issues a quarterly report on credit derivatives and in a report issued in June 2020, it placed the size of the entire market at $4 trillion, of which CDS accounted for $3.5 trillion.1

## Credit [[Default]] [[Swap]] as Insurance

A credit [[Default|default]] [[Swap|swap]] is, in effect, [insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp) against non-payment. Through a CDS, the buyer can avoid the consequences of a borrower's default by shifting some or all that [[Risk|risk]] onto an insurance company or other CDS seller in exchange for a fee. In this way, the buyer of a credit default swap receives credit protection, while the seller of the swap guarantees the [[creditworthiness]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp) of the [[Debt|debt]] [[Security|security]]. For example, the buyer of a credit default swap [[Will|will]] be entitled to the [par value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) of the contract by the seller of the swap, along with any unpaid interest, should the issuer default on payments.

It is important to note that the credit [[Risk|risk]] isn't eliminated – it has been shifted to the CDS seller. The risk is that the CDS seller defaults at the same time the borrower defaults. This was one of the primary causes of the 2008 [[credit crisis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-crisis.asp): CDS sellers like Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and AIG defaulted on their CDS obligations.2

While credit [[Risk|risk]] hasn't been eliminated through a CDS, risk has been reduced. For example, if [[Lender]] A has made a [[Loan|loan]] to Borrower B with a mid-range [[credit rating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp), Lender A can increase the quality of the loan by buying a CDS from a seller with a better credit [[Rating|rating]] and financial backing than Borrower B. The risk hasn't gone away, but it has been reduced through the CDS.

If the [[Debt|debt]] issuer does not [[Default|default]] and if all goes well, the CDS buyer [[Will|will]] end up losing money through the payments on the CDS, but the buyer stands to lose a much greater proportion of its investment if the issuer defaults and if it had not bought a CDS. As such, the more the holder of a [[Security|security]] thinks its issuer is likely to default, the more desirable a CDS is and the more it will cost.

## Credit [[Default]] [[Swap]] in Context

Any situation involving a credit [[Default|default]] [[Swap|swap]] [[Will|will]] have a minimum of three parties. The first party involved is the [institution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp) that issued the [[Debt|debt]] [[Security|security]] (borrower). The debt may be [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) or other kinds of securities and are essentially a [loan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Loan|loan]].asp) that the debt issuer has received from the [[Lender|lender]]. If a company sells a bond with a $100 face value and a 10-year [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp) to a buyer, the company is agreeing to pay back the $100 to the buyer at the end of the 10-year period as well as regular interest payments over the course of the bond's life. Yet, because the debt issuer cannot guarantee that it will be able repay the [[Premium|premium]], the [debt buyer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-buyer.asp) has taken on [[Risk|risk]].

The [[Debt|debt]] buyer is the second party in this exchange and [[Will|will]] also be the CDS buyer, if the parties decide to engage in a CDS contract. The [third party](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/third-party.asp), the CDS seller, is most often a large bank or insurance company that guarantees the [underlying debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-debt.asp) between the issuer and the buyer. This is very similar to an insurance policy on a home or car.

CDS are complex because they are traded [over-the-counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (meaning they are non-standardized). There is a lot of [[speculation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Speculation|speculation]].asp) in the CDS market, where investors can trade the obligations of the CDS if they believe they can make a profit. For example, assume there is a CDS that earns $10,000 quarterly payments to insure a $10 million bond. The company that originally sold the CDS believes that the credit quality of the borrower has improved so the CDS payments are high. The company could sell the rights to those payments and the obligations to another buyer and potentially make a profit.

Alternatively, imagine an investor who believes that Company A is likely to [[Default|default]] on its bonds. The investor can buy a CDS from a bank that [[Will|will]] pay out the value of that [[Debt|debt]] if Company A defaults. A CDS can be purchased even if the buyer does not own the debt itself. This is a bit like a neighbor buying a CDS on another home in her neighborhood because she knows that the owner is out of work and may default on the [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp).

Though credit [[Default|default]] swaps can insure the payments of a bond through maturity, they do not necessarily need to cover the entirety of the bond's life. For example, imagine an investor is two years into a 10-year [[Security|security]] and thinks that the issuer is in credit trouble. The bond owner may choose to buy a credit default [[Swap|swap]] with a five-year term that would protect the investment until the seventh year, when the bondholder believes the risks [[Will|will]] have faded.

It is even possible for investors to effectively switch sides on a credit [[Default|default]] [[Swap|swap]] to which they are already a party. For example, if a CDS seller believes that the borrower is likely to default, the CDS seller can buy its own CDS from another institution or sell the contract to another bank in order to offset the risks. The chain of ownership of a CDS can become very long and convoluted, which makes tracking the size of this market difficult.

## Real World Example of a Credit [[Default]] [[Swap]]

Credit [[Default|default]] swaps were widely used during the European Sovereign [[Debt]] crisis.3 In September 2011, Greece government bonds had a 94% probability of default. Many [[Hedge|hedge]] funds even used CDS as a way to speculate on the likelihood that the country would default.
