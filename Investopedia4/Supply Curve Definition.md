[[Supply Curve Definition]]
## What Is a [[Supply]] Curve?

The [[Supply|supply]] curve is a graphic representation of the [[Correlation|correlation]] between the cost of a good or service and the [[quantity supplied]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitysupplied.asp) for a given period. In a typical illustration, the price [[Will|will]] appear on the left vertical axis, while the [[Quantity Supplied|quantity supplied]] will appear on the horizontal axis.

### Key Takeaways

-   On most [[Supply|supply]] curves, as the price of a good increases, the quantity of supplies increases.
-   [[Supply]] curves can often show if a commodity [[Will|will]] experience a price increase or decrease based on demand, and vice versa.
-   The [[Supply|supply]] curve is shallower (closer to horizontal) for products with more elastic supply and steeper (closer to vertical) for products with less elastic supply.

## How a [[Supply]] Curve Works

The [[Supply|supply]] curve [[Will|will]] move upward from left to right, which expresses the [[law of supply]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofsupply.asp): As the price of a given commodity increases, the [[Quantity Supplied|quantity supplied]] increases (all else being equal).

Note that this formulation implies that price is the independent variable, and quantity the dependent variable. In most disciplines, the independent variable appears on the horizontal or x-axis, but [[Economics|economics]] is an exception to this rule.

If a factor besides price or quantity changes, a new [[Supply|supply]] curve needs to be drawn. For example, say that some new soybean farmers enter the market, clearing forests and increasing the amount of land devoted to soybean cultivation. In this scenario, more soybeans [[Will|will]] be produced even if the price remains the same, meaning that the supply curve itself shifts to the right (S2) in the graph below. In other words, supply will increase.

Technology is a leading cause of [[Supply|supply]] curve shifts.

Other factors can shift the [[Supply|supply]] curve as well, such as a change in the [[price of production]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/production-cost.asp). If a drought causes water prices to spike, the curve [[Will|will]] shift to the left (S3). If the price of a [[substitute]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substitute.asp)—from the supplier's perspective—such as corn increases, farmers will shift to growing that instead, and the supply of soybeans will decrease (S3).

If a new technology, such as a pest-resistant seed, increases yields, the [[Supply|supply]] curve [[Will|will]] shift right (S2). If the [[future price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Futures|futures]].asp) of soybeans is higher than the current price, the supply will temporarily shift to the left (S3), since producers have an incentive to wait to sell.

## [[Supply]] Curve Example

Should the price of soybeans rise, farmers [[Will|will]] have an incentive to plant less corn and more soybeans, and the total quantity of soybeans on the market will increase. 

The degree to which rising price translates into rising quantity is called [[supply elasticity]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040615/how-does-price-elasticity-affect-[[Supply|supply]].asp) or price elasticity of supply. If a 50% rise in soybean prices causes the number of soybeans produced to rise by 50%, the supply elasticity of soybeans is 1.

On the other hand, if a 50% rise in soybean prices only increases the [[Quantity Supplied|quantity supplied]] by 10 percent, the [[Supply|supply]] elasticity is 0.2. The supply curve is shallower (closer to horizontal) for products with more elastic supply and steeper (closer to vertical) for products with less elastic supply.

## Special Considerations

The terminology surrounding [[Supply|supply]] can be confusing. "Quantity" or "[[Quantity Supplied|quantity supplied]]" refers to the amount of the good or service, such as tons of soybeans, bushels of tomatoes, available hotel rooms, or hours of labor. In everyday usage, this might be called the "supply," but in economic theory, "supply" refers to the curve shown above, denoting the relationship between quantity supplied and price per unit.

Other factors can also cause changes in the [[Supply|supply]] curve, such as technology. Any advances that increase production and make it more efficient can cause a shift to the right in the supply curve. Similarly, market expectations and the number of sellers (or competition) can affect the curve as well.
