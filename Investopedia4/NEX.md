[[NEX]]
## What is [[NEX]]

[[NEX]] is a separate board on the TSX Venture [[Stock|stock]] [[exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp) that provides a unique trading forum for [[Listed|listed]] companies that no longer meet the TSX Venture's ongoing listing standards. The NEX is designed for companies that have low levels of business activity or have ceased to carry on active business. It benefits such companies by giving their [[Stocks|stocks]] a degree of [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) and providing [[Visibility|visibility]] that may attract potential acquirers or investors. These companies are identified by an "H" or "K" extension to their trading symbols.

## BREAKING DOWN [[NEX]]

[[NEX]] was launched as a subset of the TSX Venture Exchange, a Canadian [[Stock|stock]] exchange headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. The TSX Venture Exchange is a public [[venture capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp) marketplace that allows investors to invest in [[small cap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp) and emerging companies. The TSX Venture Exchange was formerly known as the Canadian Venture Exchange before it was acquired and renamed by the TSX Group in 2001. The TSX Group was renamed the TMX Group shortly afterward. Both the Canadian Venture Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange focused on companies that were too small to be [[Listed|listed]] on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which is also owned by the TMX Group.

Prior to the launch of [[NEX]] by the TSX Group, companies that could not meet the TSX Venture Exchange's continuous listing criteria were designated as "inactive" and given 18 months to either meet the listing standards or be delisted. The introduction of NEX relieved such companies of the tremendous pressure of a [[Delisting|delisting]] deadline, and gave their management and [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) another opportunity to turn things around.  Companies that do not meet the TSX Venture Exchange’s listing requirements are typically moved to the NEX Board after 90 days. They can remain on the NEX board indefinitely. Companies that have never been [[Listed|listed]] on TSX or TSX Venture Exchange cannot be listed on NEX.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of [[NEX]] 

[[NEX]] has lower listing fees and simplified rules, compared to the TSX Venture Exchange.

The companies [[Listed|listed]] on the [[NEX]] board tend to have low levels of business activity compared to those on the TSX Venture Exchange. Companies on the NEX board remain publicly traded even as reassess their business strategy. However, some of these companies may not be able to do so successfully.

It is important to note that [[NEX]] companies must continue to meet the same [[disclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disclosure.asp) standards applicable to all Canadian public companies, and must also maintain good standing with the relevant Canadian securities commissions.
