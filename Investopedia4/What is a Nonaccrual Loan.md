[[What is a Nonaccrual Loan]]?
## [[What is a Nonaccrual Loan|What Is a Nonaccrual Loan]]?

A nonaccrual [[Loan|loan]] is a [[Lender|lender]]'s term for an [[Unsecured Loan|unsecured loan]] whose payment is 90 days or more overdue. The loan is no longer generating its stated interest rate because no payment has been made by the borrower. It is, therefore, a [[nonperforming loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonperformingloan.asp).

Loans can have interest credited only when the borrower makes a payment (of a portion of the [[Principal|principal]] plus interest). The interest on a nonaccrual [[Loan|loan]] is thus recorded as [[Earned Income|earned income]].

Nonaccrual loans are sometimes referred to as doubtful loans, troubled loans, or sour loans.

## How a Nonaccrual [[Loan]] Works

A [[Loan|loan]] becomes a nonaccrual loan when no payment has been received after 90 days. The bank classifies the loan as substandard and reports the change to the [[credit reporting agencies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-reporting-agency.asp), which lowers the borrower's [[Credit Score|credit score]].

### Key Takeaways

-   A lending institution categorizes an [[Unsecured|unsecured]] [[Debt|debt]] as a nonaccrual [[Loan|loan]] if no payment has been made for 90 days or more.
-   In accounting terms, the expected interest has not accrued to the [[Lender|lender]] because no interest has been paid by the customer.
-   A borrower can work out a repayment plan to restore the [[Loan|loan]] to its previous status.

The [[Lender|lender]] changes its allowance for the potential [[Loan|loan]] loss, sets aside a reserve to protect the bank's financial interests, and may take legal action against the borrower.

The [[Loan|loan]] is also put on a [[cash basis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-basis-loan.asp), meaning that interest is recorded as earned only if and when a payment is collected, not as an assumed payment. Ordinarily, interest income is accrued on loans, since regular payment of both [principal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) and interest is assumed. 

According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), an asset is to be reported as being in nonaccrual status if one of three criteria are met:

-   It is maintained on a cash basis because of a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower,
-   Payment in full of [[Principal|principal]] or interest is not expected, or,
-   [[Principal]] or interest has been in [[Default|default]] for 90 days or more unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection. 

A well-secured asset is one that is backed by [[Collateral|collateral]] such as a [[Lien|lien]], a pledge of real or [[Personal Property|personal property]], or securities valuable enough to cover the [[Debt|debt]], or is guaranteed by a financially responsible [[Third Party|third party]].

An unaccrued [[Loan|loan]] is classified as substandard and the borrower is reported to the credit agencies.

## Restructuring a Nonaccrual [[Loan]]

After entering nonaccrual status, the borrower usually can work with the [[Lender|lender]] to determine a plan for paying off the [[Debt|debt]]. After reviewing the borrower's income and expense status, the lender may create a troubled debt restructure (TDR).

The TDR may erase part of the [[Loan|loan]]'s [[Principal|principal]] or interest payments, lower the interest rate, allow interest-only payments, or modify the repayment terms in some other way. Lower [[Debt|debt]] payments may be accepted until the borrower's financial situation improves.

### Returning a [[Loan]] to Accrual Status

A [[Loan|loan]] [[Will|will]] be returned to accrual status if the borrower pays all the overdue [[Principal|principal]], interest, and fees and resumes the regular monthly payments defined in the contract.

If both parties agree, another option involves resuming the scheduled [[Principal|principal]] and interest payments for six months and providing the [[Lender|lender]] reasonable reassurance that the outstanding principal, interest, and fees [[Will|will]] be paid within a set period of time.

A third option requires the borrower to provide [[Collateral|collateral]] for securing the [[Loan|loan]] to the [[Lender|lender]], repaying the outstanding balance within 30 to 90 days, and resuming monthly payments.
