[[Short-Term Investments]]
## What Are [[Short-Term Investments]]?

[[Short-Term Investments|Short-term investments]], also known as [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]] or temporary investments, are those which can easily be converted to cash, typically within 5 years. Many short-term investments are sold or converted to cash after a period of only 3-12 months. Some common examples of short term investments include CDs, [[Money Market|money market]] accounts, high-[[Yield|yield]] savings accounts, government bonds and Treasury bills. Usually, these investments are high-quality and highly liquid assets or investment vehicles.

[[Short-Term Investments|Short-term investments]] may also refer specifically to financial assets—of a similar kind, but with a few additional requirements—that are owned by a company. Recorded in a separate account,  
and [[Listed|listed]] in the [[current assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp) section of the corporate balance sheet, these are investments that a company has made that are expected to be converted into cash within one year.

## How [[Short-Term Investments]] Work

The goal of a short-term investment—for both companies and individual/institutional investors—is to protect capital while also generating a [[Return|return]] similar to a Treasury bill index fund or another similar benchmark.

Companies in a strong [[cash position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash_position.asp) [[Will|will]] have a [[Short-Term Investments|short-term investments]] account on their balance sheet. As a result, the company can afford to invest excess cash in [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, or [[cash equivalents]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashequivalents.asp) to earn higher interest than what would be earned from a normal savings account.

There are two basic requirements for a company to classify an investment as short-term. First, it must be liquid, like a [[Stock|stock]] [[Listed|listed]] on a major exchange that trades frequently or [[U.S. Treasury]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp) bonds. Second, the management must intend to sell the [[Security|security]] within a relatively short period, such as 12 months. Marketable [[Debt|debt]] securities, aka "short-term paper," that mature within a year or less, such as U.S. Treasury bills and [[commercial paper]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp), also count as [[Short-Term Investments|short-term investments]].

Marketable [[Equity|equity]] securities include investments in common and [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp). Marketable [[Debt|debt]] securities can include corporate bonds—that is, bonds issued by another company—but they also need to have short maturity dates and should be actively traded to be considered liquid.

### Key Takeaways

## Examples of [[Short-Term Investments]]

Some [[common short-term investments and strategies]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-are-short-term-investment-options/) used by corporations and individual investors include:

-   **Certificates of deposit (CDs):** These deposits are offered by banks and typically pay a higher interest rate because they lock up cash for a given period. They are FDIC-insured up to $250,000.
-   **[Money market accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarket.asp):** Returns on these FDIC-insured accounts [[Will|will]] beat those on savings accounts, but require a minimum investment. Keep in mind that [[Money Market|money market]] accounts differ from money market mutual funds, which are not FDIC-insured.
-   **Treasuries:** There are a variety of these government-issued bonds, such as notes, bills, floating-rate notes, and [[Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp) (TIPS).
-   **Bond funds:** Offered by professional asset managers/investment companies, these funds are better for a shorter time frame and can [[Offer|offer]] better-than-average returns for the [[Risk|risk]]. Just be aware of the fees.
-    **[Municipal bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp):** These bonds, issued by local, state, or non-federal government agencies, can [[Offer|offer]] higher yields and tax advantages since they are often exempt from income taxes.
-   **[Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peer-to-peer-lending.asp):** Excess cash can be put into play via one of these lending platforms that match borrowers to lenders.
-   **[Roth IRAs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp):** For individuals, these vehicles can [[Offer|offer]] flexibility and a variety of investment options. Contributions, but not gains, to Roth IRAs can be withdrawn at any time, without penalty or taxes due.

If you have excess cash, using it to pay off higher-interest [[Debt|debt]] may be more advantageous than investing it in low-[[Risk|risk]] but low-[[Return|return]] [[Short-Term Investments|short-term investments]].
