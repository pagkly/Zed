[[What Is Surety]]?
## [[What Is Surety]]?

The surety is the guarantee of the debts of one party by another. A surety is an organization or person that assumes the responsibility of paying the [[Debt|debt]] in case the [[Debtor|debtor]] policy defaults or is unable to make the payments.

The party that guarantees the [[Debt|debt]] is referred to as the surety, or as the [[guarantor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guarantor.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A surety is a person or party that takes responsibility for the [[Debt|debt]], [[Default|default]] or other financial responsibilities of another party.
-   A surety is often used in contracts where one party's financial [[Holdings|holdings]] or well-being are in question and the other party wants a guarantor.
-   Surety bonds are financial instruments that tie the [[Principal|principal]], the obligee—often a government entity—and the surety.
-   In the case of surety bonds, the surety is providing a line of credit to the [[Principal|principal]] so as to reassure the obligee that the principal [[Will|will]] fulfill their side of the agreement.

## Surety Explained

A surety is most common in contracts in which one party questions whether the [[counterparty]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Counterparty|counterparty]].asp) in the contract [[Will|will]] be able to fulfill all requirements. The party may require the counterparty to come forward with a guarantor [[in order to reduce risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp), with the guarantor entering into a contract of suretyship. This is intended to lower [[Risk|risk]] to the [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp), which might, in turn, lower interest rates for the borrower. A surety can be in the form of a "surety bond."

A surety bond is a legally binding contract entered into by three parties—the [[Principal|principal]], the obligee, and the surety. The obligee, usually a government entity, requires the principal, typically a business owner or contractor, to obtain a surety bond as a guarantee against future work performance.

The surety is the company that provides a [[line of credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lineofcredit.asp) to guarantee payment of any claim. They provide a [[financial guarantee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-guarantee.asp) to the obligee that the [[Principal|principal]] [[Will|will]] fulfill their obligations. A principal’s obligations could mean complying with state laws and regulations pertaining to a specific business license, or meeting the terms of a construction contract.

If the [[Principal|principal]] fails to deliver on the terms of the contract entered into with the obligee, the obligee has the right to file a claim against the bond to recover any damages or losses incurred. If the claim is valid, the surety company [[Will|will]] pay reparation that cannot exceed the bond amount. The underwriters will then expect the principal to reimburse them for any claims paid.

## Important Distinctions

A surety is not an insurance policy. The payment made to the surety company is paying for the bond, but the [[Principal|principal]] is still liable for the [[Debt|debt]]. The surety is only required to relieve the obligee of the time and resources that [[Will|will]] be used to recover any loss or damage from a principal. The claim amount is still retrieved from the principal through either [[Collateral|collateral]] posted by the principal or through other means.

A surety is not a [[bank guarantee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankguarantee.asp). Where the surety is liable for any performance [[Risk|risk]] posed by the [[Principal|principal]], the bank guarantee is liable for the financial risk of the contracted project.
