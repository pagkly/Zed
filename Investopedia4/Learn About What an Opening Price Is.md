[[Learn About What an Opening Price Is]]
## What Is Opening Price?

The opening price is the price at which a [[Security|security]] first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day; for example, the [[New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE) opens at precisely 9:30 a.m. Eastern time. The price of the first trade for any [[Listed|listed]] [[Stock|stock]] is its daily opening price. The opening price is an important marker for that day's trading activity, particularly for those interested in measuring short-term results such as [[day traders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daytrader.asp).

## Opening Price Explained

The [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] uses an approach called the "[opening cross](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opening-cross.asp)" to decide the best opening price considering the orders that accumulated overnight. Typically, a [[Security|security]]'s opening price is not identical to its prior day closing price. The difference is because [after-hours trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/afterhourstrading.asp) has changed investor valuations or expectations for the security.

### Key Takeaways

-   The opening price is the price at which a [[Security|security]] first trades when an exchange opens for the day.
-   An opening price is not identical to the previous day's closing price.
-   There are several day-trading strategies based on the opening price of a market or [[Security|security]].

## Opening Price Deviation

Corporate announcements or other news events that occur after the market closes can change investor expectations and opening price. Large-scale natural disasters or man-made disasters, such as wars or terrorist attacks that occur in after hours, may have similar effects on [[Stock|stock]] prices. When these events occur, some investors may try to buy or sell securities during the after hours.

Not all orders are executed during after-hours trading. The lack of [[Liquidity|liquidity]] and the resulting wide spreads make market orders unattractive to traders in after-hours trading because it's much more difficult to complete a transaction at a predictable price with a market order, and limit orders often won't get filled. When the market opens the next day, this large amount of limit or [[stop orders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stoporder.asp)—placed at prices different from the prior day’s closing price—causes a substantial disparity in [[Supply|supply]] and demand. This disparity makes the opening price veer away from the prior day’s close in the direction that corresponds to the effect of whatever market forces are moving the [[Stock|stock]] price.

## Opening Price Trading Strategies

There are several day-trading strategies based on the opening of a market. When the [[opening price varies]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122414/what-are-most-common-periods-used-creating-moving-average-ma-lines.asp) so much from the prior day’s close that it creates a price gap, day traders use a strategy known as “Gap Fade and Fill.” Traders attempt to profit from the price [[Correction|correction]] that usually takes place after a sizable price gap at the opening.

Another popular strategy is to [[fade]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fade.asp) a [[Stock|stock]] at the open that is showing strong pre-market indications contrary to the rest of the market or similar [[Stocks|stocks]] in a common sector or index. When a strong disparity is present in pre-market indications, a trader waits for the stock to make a move at the open contrary to the rest of the market. The trader then takes a position in the stock in the general direction of the market when [[Momentum|momentum]] and volume of the initial contrary stock price movement diminishes. When executed correctly, these are high probability strategies designed to achieve quick small profits.

## Real-Life Example

On Feb. 14, 2019, the opening price for Facebook ([FB](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/[[Stock|stock]]/fb)) was $163.84 per share. On Feb. 26, 2019, the opening price for Apple ([AAPL](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL)) was $173.71. The opening of Facebook took investors on a wild ride. The stock initially rose from its $38 price but closed the day with only a modest [[Gain|gain]], closing at $38.23.
