[[White Candlestick Definition]]
## What Is a White Candlestick?

A white candlestick depicts a period where the [[Security|security]]'s price has closed at a higher level than where it had opened. It is a point on a security's [[candlestick]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp) chart representing a bullish period.

### Key Takeaways

-   A white candlestick depicts a period where the [[Security|security]]'s price has closed at a higher level than where it had opened.
-   A candlestick [[Will|will]] show the [[Security|security]]'s open, high, low, and close for the user-specified time period.
-   Candlestick charts are convenient for technical traders because they can easily display a full day's price movement.

## Understanding White Candlesticks

White candlesticks represent a positive increase in a [[Security|security]]’s price during the observed period of time. The body of the candlestick [[Will|will]] typically be displayed in white on a candlestick series chart to show that the net result of the period's [[Price Action|price action]] was up. In some technical charting systems the trader may have the option to choose a specified color, such as blue or green, to represent price gains.

Typically, a candlestick [[Will|will]] show the [[Security|security]]'s open, high, low, and close for the user specified time period. The high and low will be shown by the two wicks on each end of the body. The body comprises the distance between the period's open and close prices. Thus, candlestick marks show the range of prices that the security has reported through a single period.

Candlestick charts are convenient for technical traders because they can easily display a full day's price movement. Generally, the [[Default|default]] colors for candlestick charts [[Will|will]] be either white/green (UP) and red/black (DOWN), though, nowadays, charting packages [[Offer|offer]] the trader the option to customize the color schemes to their specifications.

[Red/black candlesticks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/red-candlestick.asp) are the opposite of white candlesticks. They represent a downward movement for the day. In a red/black candlestick, the closing price of a [[Security|security]] is reported as lower than the opening price.

The last possibility for charting a period's [[Price Action|price action]] is where the open and close prices are identical. This is called a [[doji]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Doji|doji]].asp) and is graphically portrayed by a dash, signifying that the charted [[Security|security]]’s opening price is equal to its closing price.

## [[Technical Analysis]] Indicators

[[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] indicators are formed from the combination of white, red, and [[Doji|doji]] candlesticks. There are many short-term and long-term formations that can be used as indicators for [[Security|security]] investment. Below are a few trading patterns commonly identified on a technical analysis chart.

[Ascending channel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ascendingchannel.asp): An ascending channel is formed when a [[Security|security]]’s price is rising. This type of channel [[Will|will]] predominantly include white candlesticks.

[Descending channel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descendingchannel.asp): A descending channel is formed when a [[Security|security]]’s price is decreasing over time. This type of channel [[Will|will]] predominantly include red candlesticks.

[Bearish abandoned baby](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearish-abandoned-baby.asp): A bearish abandoned baby pattern is comprised of three consecutive candlesticks centered with a [[Doji|doji]]. A bearish abandoned baby can signal a breakout to the downside. This pattern occurs when a white candlestick is followed by a doji above the previous day’s close and then a red candlestick with an open below the previous day’s close.

[Bullish abandoned baby](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullish-abandoned-baby.asp): A bullish abandoned baby pattern is the opposite of a bearish abandoned baby. This pattern signals a potential [[Reversal|reversal]] to the [[Upside|upside]]. A bullish abandoned baby pattern [[Will|will]] begin with a red candlestick followed by a [[Doji|doji]] below the previous day’s close and then a white candlestick with an open above the previous day’s doji open/close.
