[[Held-For-Trading Security]]
## What Is a [[Held-For-Trading Security]]?

A [[Held-For-Trading Security|held-for-trading security]] is a [[Debt|debt]] or [[Equity|equity]] [[investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp) that investors purchase with the intent of selling within a short period of time, usually less than one year. Within that time frame, the investor hopes to see appreciation in the value of the [[Security|security]] and sell it for a profit.

Because of [[accounting standards]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-standard.asp), companies have to classify investments in [[Debt|debt]] or [[Equity|equity]] securities when they are purchased. Other than held-for trading, other options include [[held-to maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/held-to-maturity-[[Security|security]].asp) or [[available for sale]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/available-for-sale-security.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Held-For-Trading Security|held-for-trading security]] is a [[Debt|debt]] or [[Equity|equity]] investment purchased with the intention of short-term [[Gain|gain]].
-   Any gains or losses for a [[Held-For-Trading Security|held-for-trading security]] during its period of holding must be reported on the balance sheet of the trading firm.
-   On the balance sheet, held-for-trading securities are considered [[Current Assets|current assets]].
-   Held-for-trading securities are reported at [[Fair Value|fair value]], and unrealized/gains or losses are reflected in earnings.
-   Accounting standards require [[Debt|debt]] or [[Equity|equity]] securities to be classified when they are purchased. In addition to held-for-trading, classifications include held-to-maturity and available for sale.

## Understanding a [[Held-For-Trading Security]]

Held-for-trading securities can generate a profit from short-term price changes when investors sell them in the near term. They are short-term assets, and their accounting reflects that fact; the value of these investments is reported at [[fair value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairvalue.asp), and [[unrealized gains and/or losses]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/021204.asp) are included as [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp).

The initial cost basis of these investments equals their [[Fair Value|fair value]] at the time of purchase. Over time, the [[market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp) of trading securities changes, and investors must report any unrealized gains and/or losses as earnings. The calculation of those gains and losses involves comparing a trading [[Security|security]]'s fair market value to its original purchase cost basis.

Held-for-trading securities are classified as [[current assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp) since they [[Will|will]] be sold within a year and the cash flows from these securities are considered [[operating cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-flow-from-operating-activities.asp). Cash flows from held-to-maturity and available for sale securities are [[cash flows from investing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowfinvestingactivities.asp).

## [[Held-For-Trading Security]] and [[Fair Value]] Adjustment

Any increase or decrease in the [[Fair Value|fair value]] of a [[Held-For-Trading Security|held-for-trading security]] requires an accounting adjustment. One must add or subtract the change from the [[Security|security]]'s previously reported value on the [[financial statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp).

An accountant achieves this by debiting an increase or crediting a decrease in the fair-[[Value Change|value change]] to an account called "securities [[Fair Value|fair value]] adjustment (trading)," which is a sub-account of the asset account for trading securities. A [[debit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debit.asp) or a [[credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp) to the account of securities fair value adjustment is an accumulation or deficit, respectively, to the fair value of the trading [[Security|security]].

Changes in the [[Fair Value|fair value]] of a [[Held-For-Trading Security|held-for-trading security]] from one period to another become an [[Unrealized Gain|unrealized gain]] or loss to earnings.

A debit to the account of securities [[Fair Value|fair value]] adjustment from an increase in the [[Security|security]]'s fair value requires a credit to record the [[Unrealized Gain|unrealized gain]] that adds to net income. Conversely, a credit to the account of securities fair value adjustment from a decrease in the security's fair value requires a debit to record the unrealized loss that reduces net income.

## Example of a [[Held-For-Trading Security]]

Suppose that Company ABC purchased a [[Security|security]] with the intent of selling it within a year. That security was recorded at its purchase costs when it was bought.

Now suppose that nine months have gone by and the [[Security|security]] had a [[Fair Value|fair value]] of $1,000 as last reported on its financial statements. In the following [[quarter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quarter.asp), by the end of the current accounting period, the security is trading for $1,200 in the market, which is the fair value of the security.

Per accounting standards, the company [[Will|will]] have to record the new [[Fair Value|fair value]] of the [[Security|security]] in its quarterly reporting. The fair-value-adjustment accounting requires a debit of $200 to the securities-fair-value-adjustment account.

Given the original value of $1,000, the trading-[[Security|security]] account for this particular security ends the period with a [[Fair Value|fair value]] of $1,200. The $200 is also an [[Unrealized Gain|unrealized gain]] that is reflected in earnings.

When the next accounting period arrives and the updated [[Fair Value|fair value]] of the [[Security|security]] needs to be recorded, the calculation determining an increase or decrease [[Will|will]] start from $1,200.
