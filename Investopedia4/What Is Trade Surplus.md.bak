[[What Is Trade Surplus]]?
A trade [[Surplus|surplus]] is an economic measure of a positive [[balance of trade]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bot.asp), where a country's exports exceed its imports.

-   Trade Balance = Total Value of Exports - Total Value of Imports

A trade [[Surplus|surplus]] occurs when the result of the above calculation is positive. A trade surplus represents a net inflow of domestic currency from foreign markets. It is the opposite of a [[trade deficit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade_deficit.asp), which represents a net outflow, and occurs when the result of the above calculation is negative. In the United States, trade balances are reported monthly by the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bea.asp).

## Breaking Down Trade [[Surplus]]

A trade [[Surplus|surplus]] can create employment and economic growth, but may also lead to higher prices and interest rates within an economy. A country’s trade balance can also influence the value of its currency in the global markets, as it allows a country to have control of the majority of its currency through trade. In many cases, a trade surplus helps to strengthen a country’s currency relative to other currencies, affecting [[currency exchange rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[Macroeconomics|macroeconomics]].asp); however, this is dependent on the proportion of goods and services of a country in comparison to other countries, as well as other market factors. When focusing solely on trade effects, a trade surplus means there is high demand for a country’s goods in the global market, which pushes the price of those goods higher and leads to a direct strengthening of the domestic currency.

## [[Trade Deficit]]

The opposite of a trade [[Surplus|surplus]] is a [[Trade Deficit|trade deficit]]. A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more than it exports. A trade deficit typically also has the opposite effect on currency exchange rates. When imports exceed exports, a country’s currency demand in terms of international trade is lower. Lower demand for currency makes it less valuable in the [[International Markets|international markets]].

While trade balances highly affect currency fluctuations in most cases, there are a few factors countries can manage that make trade balances less influential. Countries can manage a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of investments in foreign accounts to control the [[Volatility|volatility]] and movement of the currency. Additionally, countries can also agree on a [[pegged currency rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-peg.asp) that keeps the exchange rate of their currency constant at a fixed rate. If a currency is not pegged to another currency, its exchange rate is considered [[floating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatingexchangerate.asp). Floating exchange rates are highly volatile and subject to daily trading whims within the currency market, which is one of the global financial market’s largest trading arenas.
