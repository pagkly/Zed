# [[Derivative]] Definition

> ## Excerpt
> A [[Derivative|derivative]] is a securitized contract between two or more parties whose value is dependent upon or derived from one or more [[Underlying|underlying]] assets. Its price is determined by fluctuations in that asset, which can be [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, currencies, commodities, or market indexes.

## What Is a [[Derivative]]?

A [[Derivative|derivative]] is a [[financial security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) with a value that is reliant upon or derived from, an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset or group of assets—a benchmark. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties, and the derivative derives its price from fluctuations in the underlying asset.

The most common [[Underlying|underlying]] assets for derivatives are [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes. These assets are commonly purchased through brokerages.

Derivatives can trade [[Over-The-Counter (OTC)|over-the-counter (OTC)]] or on an exchange. OTC derivatives constitute a greater proportion of the derivatives market. OTC-traded derivatives, generally have a greater possibility of [[counterparty risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp). [[Counterparty]] [[Risk|risk]] is the danger that one of the parties involved in the transaction might [[Default|default]]. These parties trade between two private parties and are unregulated.

Conversely, derivatives that are [[exchange-traded]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) are standardized and more heavily regulated.

## The Basics of a [[Derivative]]

Derivatives can be used to [[Hedge|hedge]] a position, speculate on the directional movement of an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset, or give [[Leverage|leverage]] to [[Holdings|holdings]]. Their value comes from the fluctuations of the values of the underlying asset.

Originally, derivatives were used to ensure balanced exchange rates for goods traded internationally. With the differing values of national currencies, international traders needed a system to account for differences. Today, derivatives are based upon a wide variety of transactions and have many more uses. There are even derivatives based on weather data, such as the amount of rain or the number of sunny days in a region.

For example, imagine a European investor, whose investment accounts are all denominated in euros ([[EUR]]). This investor purchases [[Shares|shares]] of a U.S. company through a U.S. exchange using U.S. dollars (USD). Now the investor is exposed to [[exchange-rate risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreignexchangerisk.asp) while holding that [[Stock|stock]]. Exchange-rate [[Risk|risk]] the threat that the value of the euro [[Will|will]] increase in relation to the USD. If the value of the euro rises, any profits the investor realizes upon selling the stock become less valuable when they are converted into euros.

To [[Hedge|hedge]] this [[Risk|risk]], the investor could purchase a currency [[Derivative|derivative]] to lock in a specific exchange rate. Derivatives that could be used to hedge this kind of risk include [[currency futures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyfuture.asp) and [[currency swaps]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyswap.asp).

A speculator who expects the euro to appreciate compared to the dollar could profit by using a [[Derivative|derivative]] that rises in value with the euro. When using derivatives to speculate on the price movement of an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset, the investor does not need to have a holding or [[Portfolio|portfolio]] presence in the underlying asset.

### Key Takeaways

-   Derivatives are securities that derive their value from an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset or benchmark.
-   Common derivatives include [[Futures|futures]] contracts, forwards, [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070615/what-difference-between-derivatives-and-options.asp), and swaps.
-   Most derivatives are not traded on exchanges and are used by institutions to [[Hedge|hedge]] [[Risk|risk]] or speculate on price changes in the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset.
-   Exchange-traded derivatives like [[Futures|futures]] or [[Stock|stock]] options are standardized and eliminate or reduce many of the risks of over-the-counter derivatives
-   Derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, which increases their potential risks and rewards.

## Common Forms of Derivatives

There are many different types of derivatives that can be used for [[Risk|risk]] management, for [[Speculation|speculation]], and to [[Leverage|leverage]] a position. Derivatives is a growing marketplace and [[Offer|offer]] products to fit nearly any need or risk tolerance.

### [[Futures]]

[Futures contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp)—also known simply as [[Futures|futures]]—are an agreement between two parties for the purchase and delivery of an asset at an agreed upon price at a future date. Futures trade on an exchange, and the contracts are standardized. Traders [[Will|will]] use a futures contract to [[Hedge|hedge]] their [[Risk|risk]] or speculate on the price of an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset. The parties involved in the futures transaction are obligated to fulfill a commitment to buy or sell the underlying asset.

For example, say that Nov. 6, 2019, Company-A buys a [[Futures|futures]] contract for oil at a price of $62.22 per barrel that expires Dec. 19, 2019. The company does this because it needs oil in December and is concerned that the price [[Will|will]] rise before the company needs to buy. Buying an oil futures contract hedges the company's [[Risk|risk]] because the seller on the other side of the contract is obligated to deliver oil to Company-A for $62.22 per barrel once the contract has expired. Assume oil prices rise to $80 per barrel by Dec. 19, 2019. Company-A can accept delivery of the oil from the seller of the futures contract, but if it no longer needs the oil, it can also sell the contract before expiration and keep the profits.

In this example, it is possible that both the [[Futures|futures]] buyer and seller were hedging [[Risk|risk]]. Company-A needed oil in the future and wanted to offset the risk that the price may rise in December with a long position in an oil futures contract. The seller could be an oil company that was concerned about falling oil prices and wanted to eliminate that risk by selling or "[shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)" a futures contract that fixed the price it would get in December.

It is also possible that the seller or buyer—or both—of the oil [[Futures|futures]] parties were speculators with the opposite opinion about the direction of December oil. If the parties involved in the futures contract were speculators, it is unlikely that either of them would want to make arrangements for delivery of several barrels of [[Crude Oil|crude oil]]. Speculators can end their obligation to purchase or deliver the [[Underlying|underlying]] commodity by closing—unwinding—their contract before expiration with an offsetting contract.

For example, the [[Futures|futures]] contract for [[West Texas Intermediate (WTI)]] oil trades on the CME represents 1,000 barrels of oil. If the price of oil rose from $62.22 to $80 per barrel, the trader with the long position—the buyer—in the futures contract would have profited $17,780 \[($80 - $62.22) X 1,000 = $17,780\]. The trader with the short position—the seller—in the contract would have a loss of $17,780.

Not all [[Futures|futures]] contracts are settled at expiration by delivering the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset. Many derivatives are cash-settled, which means that the [[Gain|gain]] or loss in the trade is simply an accounting [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] to the trader's brokerage account. Futures contracts that are cash settled include many interest rate futures, [[stock index futures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfutures.asp), and more unusual instruments like [[Volatility|volatility]] futures or weather futures.

### Forwards

[Forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp)—known simply as forwards—are similar to [[Futures|futures]], but do not trade on an exchange, only over-the-counter. When a forward contract is created, the buyer and seller may have customized the terms, size and settlement process for the [[Derivative|derivative]]. As OTC products, forward contracts carry a greater degree of [[Counterparty|counterparty]] [[Risk|risk]] for both buyers and sellers.

[[Counterparty]] risks are a kind of credit [[Risk|risk]] in that the buyer or seller may not be able to live up to the obligations outlined in the contract. If one party of the contract becomes insolvent, the other party may have no recourse and could lose the value of its position. Once created, the parties in a forward contract can offset their position with other counterparties, which can increase the potential for counterparty risks as more traders become involved in the same contract.

### Swaps

Swaps are another common type of [[Derivative|derivative]], often used to exchange one kind of [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] with another. For example, a trader might use an [[interest rate swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp) to switch from a variable interest rate [[Loan|loan]] to a fixed interest rate loan, or vice versa.

Imagine that Company XYZ has borrowed $1,000,000 and pays a variable rate of interest on the [[Loan|loan]] that is currently 6%. XYZ may be concerned about rising interest rates that [[Will|will]] increase the costs of this loan or encounter a [[Lender|lender]] that is reluctant to extend more credit while the company has this variable rate [[Risk|risk]].

Assume that XYZ creates a [[Swap|swap]] with Company QRS, which is willing to exchange the payments owed on the variable rate [[Loan|loan]] for the payments owed on a fixed rate loan of 7%. That means that XYZ [[Will|will]] pay 7% to QRS on its $1,000,000 [[Principal|principal]], and QRS will pay XYZ 6% interest on the same principal. At the beginning of the swap, XYZ will just pay QRS the 1% difference between the two [[swap rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swaprate.asp).

If interest rates fall so that the variable rate on the original [[Loan|loan]] is now 5%, Company XYZ [[Will|will]] have to pay Company QRS the 2% difference on the loan. If interest rates rise to 8%, then QRS would have to pay XYZ the 1% difference between the two [[Swap|swap]] rates. Regardless of how interest rates change, the swap has achieved XYZ's original objective of turning a variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan.

Swaps can also be constructed to exchange currency exchange rate [[Risk|risk]] or the risk of [[Default|default]] on a [[Loan|loan]] or cash flows from other business activities. Swaps related to the cash flows and potential defaults of mortgage bonds are an extremely popular kind of [[Derivative|derivative]]—a bit too popular. In the past. It was the [[Counterparty|counterparty]] risk of swaps like this that eventually spiraled into the credit crisis of 2008.

### Options

An [[options contract]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) is similar to a [[Futures|futures]] contract in that it is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date for a specific price. The key difference between options and futures is that, with an option, the buyer is not obliged to exercise their agreement to buy or sell. It is an opportunity only, not an obligation—futures are obligations. As with futures, options may be used to [[Hedge|hedge]] or speculate on the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset.

Imagine an investor owns 100 [[Shares|shares]] of a [[Stock|stock]] worth $50 per share they believe the stock's value [[Will|will]] rise in the future. However, this investor is concerned about potential risks and decides to [[Hedge|hedge]] their position with an option. The investor could buy a put option that gives them the right to sell 100 shares of the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock for $50 per share—known as the [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp)—until a specific day in the future—known as the [[expiration date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp).

Assume that the [[Stock|stock]] falls in value to $40 per share by expiration and the put option buyer decides to exercise their option and sell the stock for the original strike price of $50 per share. If the put option cost the investor $200 to purchase, then they have only lost the cost of the option because the strike price was equal to the price of the stock when they originally bought the put. A strategy like this is called a [[protective put]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protective-put.asp) because it hedges the stock's downside [[Risk|risk]].

Alternatively, assume an investor does not own the [[Stock|stock]] that is currently worth $50 per share. However, they believe that the stock [[Will|will]] rise in value over the next month. This investor could buy a call option that gives them the right to buy the stock for $50 before or at expiration. Assume that this call option cost $200 and the stock rose to $60 before expiration. The call buyer can now exercise their option and buy a stock worth $60 per share for the $50 strike price, which is an initial profit of $10 per share. A call option represents 100 [[Shares|shares]], so the real profit is $1,000 less the cost of the option—the [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-[[Premium|premium]].asp)—and any brokerage [[Commission|commission]] fees.

In both examples, the put and call option sellers are obligated to fulfill their side of the contract if the call or put option buyer chooses to exercise the contract. However, if a [[Stock|stock]]'s price is above the strike price at expiration, the put [[Will|will]] be worthless and the seller—the option writer—gets to keep the [[Premium|premium]] as the option expires. If the stock's price is below the strike price at expiration, the call will be worthless and the call seller will keep the premium. Some options can be exercised before expiration. These are known as [[American-style]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/americanoption.asp) options, but their use and early exercise are rare.

## Advantages of Derivatives

As the above examples illustrate, derivatives can be a useful tool for businesses and investors alike. They provide a way to lock in prices, [[Hedge|hedge]] against unfavorable movements in rates, and mitigate risks—often for a limited cost. In addition, derivatives can often be purchased on margin—that is, with borrowed funds—which makes them even less expensive.

## Downside of Derivatives

On the downside, derivatives are difficult to value because they are based on the price of another asset. The risks for OTC derivatives include counter-party risks that are difficult to predict or value as well. Most derivatives are also sensitive to changes in the amount of time to expiration, the cost of holding the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset, and interest rates. These variables make it difficult to perfectly match the value of a [[Derivative|derivative]] with the underlying asset.

Pros

-   Lock in prices
    
-   [[Hedge]] against [[Risk|risk]]
    
-   Can be leveraged
    
-   Diversify [[Portfolio|portfolio]]
    

Cons

-   Hard to value
    
-   Subject to [[Counterparty|counterparty]] [[Default|default]] (if OTC)
    
-   Complex to understand
    
-   Sensitive to [[Supply|supply]] and demand factors
    

Also, since the [[Derivative|derivative]] itself has no intrinsic value—its value comes only from the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset—it is vulnerable to [[Market Sentiment|market sentiment]] and market [[Risk|risk]]. It is possible for [[Supply|supply]] and demand factors to cause a derivative's price and its [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) to rise and fall, regardless of what is happening with the price of the underlying asset.

Finally, derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, and using [[Leverage|leverage]] cuts both ways. While it can increase the rate of [[Return|return]] it also makes losses mount more quickly.

## Real World Example of Derivatives

Many [[Derivative|derivative]] instruments are [[leveraged]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp). That means a small amount of capital is required to have an interest in a large amount of value in the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset.

For example, an investor who expects the [[S&P 500 Index]] to rise in value could buy a [[Futures|futures]] contract based on that venerable [[Equity|equity]] index of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies. The [[notional value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notionalvalue.asp) of a futures contract on the S&P 500 is $250,000.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are derivatives?

Derivatives are securities whose value is dependent on—or “derived from”—an [[underlying asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]].asp). For example, an [[oil futures contract]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/040615/introduction-trading-oil-[[Futures|futures]].asp) is a type of [[Derivative|derivative]] whose value is based on the market price of oil. Derivatives have become increasingly popular in recent decades, with the [[total value of derivatives outstanding]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052715/how-big-derivatives-market.asp) currently estimated at over $600 trillion.

### What are some examples of derivatives?

Common examples of derivatives include [[futures contracts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Futures|futures]].asp), [[options contracts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), and [[credit default swaps]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp). Beyond these, there is a vast quantity of [[Derivative|derivative]] contracts tailored to meet the needs of a diverse range of counterparties. In fact, since many derivatives are traded [[over the counter (OTC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp), they can in principle be infinitely customized.

### What are the main benefits and risks of derivatives?

Derivatives can be a very convenient way to achieve financial goals. For example, a company that wants to [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) against its exposure to commodities can do so by buying or selling energy derivatives such as [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] [[Futures|futures]]. Similarly, a company could hedge its currency [[Risk|risk]] by purchasing currency forward contracts. Derivatives can also help investors [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp) their positions, such as by buying equities through [[Stock|stock]] options rather than [[Shares|shares]]. The main drawbacks of derivatives include [[counterparty risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp), the inherent risks of leverage, and the fact that complicated webs of [[Derivative|derivative]] contracts can lead to [[systemic risks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systemic-risk.asp).
