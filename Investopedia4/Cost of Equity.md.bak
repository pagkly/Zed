[[Cost of Equity]]
## What Is the [[Cost of Equity]]?

The [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] is the [[Return|return]] a company requires to decide if an investment meets capital return requirements. Firms often use it as a capital budgeting threshold for the [[required rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredrateofreturn.asp). A firm's cost of [[Equity|equity]] represents the compensation the market demands in exchange for owning the asset and bearing the [[Risk|risk]] of ownership. The traditional formula for the cost of equity is the dividend capitalization model and the [[capital asset pricing model (CAPM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp).

## [[Cost of Equity]] Formula

Using the dividend capitalization model, the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] is:

Cost of [[Equity]]\=DPSCMV+GRDwhere:DPS\=dividends per share, for next yearCMV\=current market value of stockGRD\=growth rate of dividends\\begin{aligned} &\\text{[[Cost of Equity]]} = \\frac { \\text{DPS} }{ \\text{CMV} } + \\text{GRD} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{DPS} = \\text{dividends per share, for next year} \\\\ &\\text{CMV} = \\text{current market value of [[Stock|stock]]} \\\\ &\\text{GRD} = \\text{growth rate of dividends} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

## Understanding the [[Cost of Equity]]

The [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] refers to two separate concepts depending on the party involved. If you are the [[investor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp), the cost of [[Equity|equity]] is the rate of [[Return|return]] required on an investment in equity. If you are the company, the cost of equity determines the required rate of return on a particular project or investment.

There are two ways a company can raise capital: [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp) or [[Equity|equity]]. Debt is cheaper, but the company must pay it back. Equity does not need to be repaid, but it generally costs more than debt capital due to the tax advantages of interest payments. Since the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] is higher than debt, it generally provides a higher rate of [[Return|return]].

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Cost of Equity|Cost of equity]] is the [[Return|return]] a company requires for an investment or project, or the return an individual requires for an [[Equity|equity]] investment.
-   The formula used to calculate the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] is either the dividend capitalization model or the capital asset pricing model.
-   The downfall of the dividend capitalization model, although it is simpler and easier to calculate, is that it requires the company pays a dividend.
-   The [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]], generally calculated using the [[Weighted|weighted]] average cost of capital, includes both the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] and [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]].

## Special Considerations

The dividend capitalization model can be used to calculate the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]], but it requires that a company pays dividends. The calculation is based on future dividends. The theory behind the equation is the company's obligation to pay dividends is the cost of paying shareholders and therefore the cost of [[Equity|equity]]. This is a limited model in its interpretation of costs.

The capital asset pricing model, however, can be used on any [[Stock|stock]], even if the company does not pay dividends. That said, the theory behind CAPM is more complicated. The theory suggests the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] is based on the stock's [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) and level of [[Risk|risk]] compared to the general market.

### The CAPM Formula is:

[[Cost of Equity]] = [[Risk]]-Free Rate of [[Return]] + Beta \* (Market Rate of Return - Risk-Free Rate of Return)

In this equation, the [[risk-free rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]]-freerate.asp) is the rate of [[Return|return]] paid on risk-free investments such as Treasuries. [[Beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) is a measure of risk calculated as a regression on the company's [[Stock|stock]] price. The higher the [[Volatility|volatility]], the higher the beta and relative risk compared to the general market. The market rate of return is the [[average market rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp), which has generally been assumed to be roughly 10% over the past 80 years. In general, a company with a high beta, that is, a company with a high degree of risk [[Will|will]] have a higher [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]].

The [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] can mean two different things, depending on who's using it. Investors use it as a benchmark for an [[Equity|equity]] investment, while companies use it for projects or related investments.

## [[Cost of Equity]] vs. [[Cost of Capital]]

The [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp) is the total cost of raising capital, taking into account both the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] and the [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]]. A stable, well-performing company, [[Will|will]] generally have a lower [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]]. To calculate the cost of capital, the cost of [[Equity|equity]] and cost of [[Debt|debt]] must be [[Weighted|weighted]] and then added together. The cost of capital is generally calculated using the [[weighted average cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp).
