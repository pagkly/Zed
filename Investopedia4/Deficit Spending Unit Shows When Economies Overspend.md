[[Deficit Spending Unit Shows When Economies Overspend]]
## [[What Is a Deficit]] Spending Unit?

A [[deficit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit.asp) spending unit is an economic term used to describe how an economy, or an economic group within that economy, has spent more than it has earned over a specified measurement period. Both companies and governments may experience a [[Deficit Spending|deficit spending]] unit.

When an entity spends more than they take in, they may sell [[Debt|debt]] to raise funds. Governments sell Treasury notes and other instruments, while companies may sell [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) or other assets.

Deficit spenders can be individuals, sectors, countries, or even a whole economy. When a [[Deficit Spending|deficit spending]] unit is an entire country, it is often forced to borrow from countries that operate as [[Surplus|surplus]] spenders. The effects of deficit spending, if left unchecked, could be a threat to economic growth. It could force a government to raise taxes and potentially [[Default|default]] on its [[Debt|debt]].

## The Basics of [[Deficit Spending]] Unit Behavior

During times of economic hardship, governments and municipalities are likely to run deficits to shield the effects of a recession and to spur economic growth. Although it is doubtful that an economic unit [[Will|will]] operate at a [[Surplus|surplus]] all the time, a prolonged deficit will eventually cause long-term hardship for the economy as [[Debt|debt]] levels become too high.

According to [[Keynesian economists]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp), the multiplier theory suggests that a dollar of government spending could increase total economic output by more than a dollar. A multiplier, in economic terms, holds that a change [[Will|will]] cause a ripple effect into other sectors of the economy.

Keynesians believe that as the government spends, it [[Will|will]] cause an increase in the population's income.

In the U.S., households sometimes represent a [[Deficit Spending|deficit spending]] unit, as these households struggle financially and do not have disposable income available. As a result, they may not be able to purchase additional consumer products, [[Hold|hold]] money in banks, or invest in the [[Stock|stock]] market without government (or private) assistance.

The opposite of a [[Deficit Spending|deficit spending]] unit is a [[surplus spending unit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/surplus_spending_unit.asp), which earns more than it spends on its basic needs. Therefore, it has money left over for investment into the economy through the form of purchasing goods, investing, or lending. A [[Surplus|surplus]] spending unit can be a household, business, or any other entity that makes more than it pays to sustain itself.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Deficit Spending|deficit spending]] unit shows how much a company overspent during a specific time period.
-   The opposite of a [[Deficit Spending|deficit spending]] unit is a [[Surplus|surplus]] spending unit, which leaves money for the company to redistribute.
-   The term [[Deficit Spending|deficit spending]] unit is not only for corporations. It can be used all the way from Fortune 500 companies to household budget balancing.

## Real World Example

According to the governor's office in Illinois, the state's general funds budget deficit for the fiscal year 2020 is [[expected to be approximately $3.2 billion]](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/government/pritzker-illinois-deficit-be-435m-more-rauner-estimated) as of Feb. 8, 2019, which is roughly 16% higher than the official estimate from the end of 2018.
