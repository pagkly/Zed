[[How Hypothecation Works]]
## What Is Hypothecation?

Hypothecation occurs when an asset is pledged as [[Collateral|collateral]] to secure a [[Loan|loan]]. The owner of the asset does not give up title, possession, or ownership rights, such as income generated by the asset. However, the [[Lender|lender]] can seize the asset if the terms of the agreement are not met.

A rental property, for example, may undergo hypothecation as [[Collateral|collateral]] against a mortgage issued by a bank. While the property remains collateral, the bank has no claim on rental income that comes in; however, if the landlord defaults on the [[Loan|loan]], the bank may seize the property.

### Key Takeaways

-   Hypothecation occurs when an asset is pledged as [[Collateral|collateral]] to secure a [[Loan|loan]]. The owner of the asset does not give up title, possession, or ownership rights, such as income generated by the asset.
-   Hypothecation occurs most commonly in mortgage lending, where the home serves as [[Collateral|collateral]] but the bank does not have any claim on cash flows or income generated from it unless the borrower defaults.
-   Margin lending in brokerage accounts is another common form of hypothecation found in securities trading and investing.

## Understanding Hypothecation

Hypothecation occurs most commonly in mortgage lending. The borrower technically owns the house, but as the house is pledged as [[Collateral|collateral]], the mortgage [[Lender|lender]] has the right to seize the house if the borrower cannot meet the repayment terms of the [[loan agreement]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-personal-loans-4773300)—which occurred during the [[foreclosure crisis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure-crisis.asp). Auto loans are similarly secured by the [[Underlying|underlying]] vehicle. [[Unsecured loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp), on the other hand, do not work with hypothecation since there is no collateral to claim in the event of [[Default|default]].

As hypothecation provides [[Security|security]] to the [[Lender|lender]] because of the [[Collateral|collateral]] pledged by the borrower, it is easier to secure a [[Loan|loan]], and the lender may [[Offer|offer]] a lower interest rate than on an [[Unsecured Loan|unsecured loan]].

## Special Considerations: Hypothecation in Investing

Margin lending in brokerage accounts is another common form of hypothecation. When an investor chooses to buy on margin or sell-short, they are agreeing that those securities can be sold if necessary if there is a [[Margin Call|margin call]]. The investor owns the securities in their account, but the broker can sell them if they issue a margin call that the investor cannot meet, to cover the investors’ losses.

When banks and brokers use hypothecated [[Collateral|collateral]] as collateral to back their own transactions and trades with their client’s agreement, in order to secure a lower cost of borrowing or a [[Rebate|rebate]] on fees. This is called [[rehypothecation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp).

Rehypothecation by banks and financial institutions is a less common practice today due to the adverse impact this practice had during the [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] of 2007–2008.
