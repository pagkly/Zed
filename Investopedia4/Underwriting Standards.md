[[Underwriting Standards]]
## What Are [[Underwriting Standards]]?

[[Underwriting Standards|Underwriting standards]] are guidelines established to ensure that safe and secure loans are issued and maintained. The underwriting standards in place help to set benchmarks for how much [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp) may be issued to a person, the terms of the loans, how much debt a specific company is willing to issue, and what interest rates [[Will|will]] be charged.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Underwriting Standards|Underwriting standards]] are guidelines set by banks and lending institutions for determining whether a borrower is worthy of credit (i.e. a [[Loan|loan]]). 
-   [[Underwriting Standards|Underwriting standards]] help set how much [[Debt|debt]] should be issued, terms, and interest rates. 
-   These standards help protect banks against excessive [[Risk|risk]] and losses.
-   The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]] has previously published recommendations for [[Underwriting Standards|underwriting standards]], which include looking at credit history and assessing income sources. 

## How [[Underwriting Standards]] Work

Sound [[Underwriting Standards|underwriting standards]] protect financial institutions from excessive risks that can lead to losses. History indicates that lending and underwriting standards are generally [[pro-cyclical]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/procyclical.asp). As competitive pressures increase for [[Loan|loan]] growth, banks may be enticed to ease underwriting standards to expand the loan [[Portfolio|portfolio]] in order to generate earnings. As conditions begin to deteriorate, this easing of underwriting standards can cause banks to face an increased [[Risk|risk]], followed by rising losses and an eventual tightening of underwriting standards.

For example, during the [[financial crisis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp) of 2008-2009, some lenders reduced prepayment fees and offered heightened flexibility on the terms of the loans they issued. During that same crisis, many companies also tightened [[Underwriting Standards|underwriting standards]] (one of the culprits in the downturn).

## Requirements for [[Underwriting Standards]] 

The choice to modify a financial institution's lending terms and [[Underwriting Standards|underwriting standards]] is usually the result of decisions made by the [[board]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp) and senior management. Alternatively, subtle, de facto revisions in policies can result from how standards and procedures are actually applied in practice. In both instances, appropriate [[Risk|risk]] management steps must be taken to ensure risks are properly identified, monitored and controlled, and that [[Loan|loan]] pricing, terms or other safeguards against nonperformance are appropriate for the risks being taken.

A 1998 study of lending practices outlined six core lending terms and [[Underwriting Standards|underwriting standards]] for maintaining strong credit discipline and assuring smart credit decisions. Those standards include:

1.  Formal credit policies should communicate a bank’s [[Risk|risk]] appetite while providing specific guidance and measurement standards along with a consistent process for approving and monitoring exceptions.
2.  Formal credit approval processes should be independent of line lending functions.
3.  Standardized [[Loan|loan]] approval documents should be used that promote consistent financial analysis, [[Collateral|collateral]] valuation, guarantor support, and covenant provisions. 
4.  Use forward-looking tools to assess projections and various scenarios that focus on key determinants of performance.
5.  Use [[Risk|risk]] [[Rating|rating]] systems that accurately assess quantitative and qualitative considerations to evaluate credit risk at inception and during the life of the [[Loan|loan]].
6.  Ensure management and [[Lender|lender]] information systems support the approval process and ongoing monitoring of [[Portfolio|portfolio]] composition and [[Risk|risk]] positions.

## Example of [[Underwriting Standards]]

The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp) has its own recommended guidelines for [[Underwriting Standards|underwriting standards]] for credit cards. Per the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]], underwriting standards help ensure credit cards offered to customers meet an acceptable level of [[Risk|risk]]. Some of the key underwriting standards that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) recommends for credit cards include: 

-   Assessment of the applicant’s repayment willingness and capacity.
-   Credit history and performance on past and existing obligations. 
-   Income assessments, such as self employment income, investment income, etc.
-   Consideration of the borrower’s aggregate credit relationship with the bank.
