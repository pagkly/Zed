[[Operating Lease Explained]]
## What Is an Operating [[Lease]]?

An operating [[Lease|lease]] is a contract that allows for the use of an [[asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/what-is-an-asset.asp) but does not convey ownership rights of the asset. Operating leases are considered a form of off-balance-sheet financing—meaning a leased asset and associated liabilities (i.e. future rent payments) are not included on a company's balance sheet. Historically, operating leases have enabled American firms to keep billions of dollars of assets and liabilities from being recorded on their balance sheets, thereby keeping their [[debt-to-equity ratios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp) low.

### Key Takeaways

-   An operating [[Lease|lease]] is a contract that permits the use of an asset but does not convey ownership rights of the asset. 
-   GAAP rules govern accounting for operating leases.
-   A new FASB rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all leases—unless they are shorter than 12 months—must be recognized on the balance sheet.

## Understanding Operating Leases

To be classified as an operating [[Lease|lease]], the lease must meet certain requirements under [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)|generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)]] that exempt it from being recorded as a [[capital lease]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitallease.asp). Companies must test for four criteria—“bright line” tests—that determine whether rental contracts must be booked as operating or capital leases. Current GAAP rules require companies to treat leases as capital leases if:

-   There is an ownership transfer to the [[Lessee|lessee]] at the end of the [[Lease|lease]];
-   The [[Lease|lease]] contains a [[bargain purchase]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bargain-purchase.asp) option;
-   The [[Lease|lease]] life exceeds 75% of the asset's economic life; or,
-   The [[present value (PV)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp) of the [[Lease|lease]] payments exceed 90% of the asset's fair market value.

If none of these conditions are met, then the [[Lease|lease]] must be classified as an operating lease. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may reclassify an operating lease as a capital lease to reject the lease payments as a deduction, thus increasing the company's [[Taxable Income|taxable income]] and [[Tax Liability|tax liability]].

Typically, assets that are rented under operating leases include real [[Estate|estate]], aircraft, and equipment with long, [[Useful Life|useful life]] spans—such as vehicles, office equipment, and industry-specific machinery.

Under a new [[Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)]] rule effective Dec. 15, 2018, public companies must recognize all leases on the balance sheet unless they are shorter than 12 months.

## Special Considerations

Effective Dec. 15, 2018, [[FASB revised its rules]](https://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1176167901010&acceptedDisclaimer=true) governing [[Lease|lease]] accounting. Most significantly, the standard now requires that all leases—except short-term leases of less than a year—must be capitalized. Other changes include the following:

-   There is a difference in the bright-line test that helps to determine whether or not a [[Lessee|lessee]] has the right to control the identified asset.
-   There's a new definition of [[indirect costs]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041415/what-are-different-types-costs-cost-accounting.asp) that likely would result in fewer indirect costs being capitalized.
-   Under the new rule, for a sale or [[leaseback]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaseback.asp) to occur, the transfer of the asset must meet certain revenue recognition requirements.
-   The new rule requires a significant number of new financial statement disclosures, both quantitative and qualitative, for both parties.

## Operating [[Lease]] vs. Capital Lease

U.S. GAAP accounting treatments for operating and capital leases are different and can have a significant impact on businesses' taxes. An operating [[Lease|lease]] is treated like renting—lease payments are considered as operating expenses. Assets being leased are not recorded on the company's balance sheet; they are expensed on the income statement. So, they affect both operating and net income. Other characteristics include:

-   **Ownership:** Retained by [[Lessor|lessor]] during and after the [[Lease|lease]] term.
-   **Bargain purchase option:** Cannot contain a bargain purchase option.
-   **Term:** Less than 75% of the asset’s estimated economic life.
-   **Present value:** PV of [[Lease|lease]] payments is less than 90% of the asset's fair market value.
-   **Accounting:** No ownership [[Risk|risk]]. Payments considered as operating expenses; shown in profit and loss statement (P&L) on balance sheet.
-   **Tax:** [[Lessee]] considered to be renting; [[Lease|lease]] payment treated as a rental expense.
-   **Risks/benefits:** Right to use only. Risks/benefits remain with the [[Lessor|lessor]]. [[Lessee]] pays maintenance costs.

In contrast, a capital [[Lease|lease]] is more like a long-term [[Loan|loan]], or ownership. The asset is treated as being owned by the [[Lessee|lessee]] and is recorded on the balance sheet. Capital leases are counted as [[Debt|debt]]. They depreciate over time and incur [interest expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp). Other characteristics include:

-   **Ownership:** Might transfer to the [[Lessee|lessee]] at end of the [[Lease|lease]] term.
-   **[Bargain purchase option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bargain-purchase-option.asp):** Enables [[Lessee|lessee]] to buy an asset at less than fair market value.
-   **Term:** Equals or exceeds 75% of the asset's estimated [[Useful Life|useful life]].
-   **Present value:** PV of [[Lease|lease]] payments equals or exceeds 90% of the asset's [[Original Cost|original cost]].
-   **Accounting:** [[Lease]] considered an asset (leased asset) and [[Liability|liability]] (lease payments). Payments are shown on the balance sheet.
-   **Tax:** As owner, [[Lessee|lessee]] claims depreciation expense, and interest expense.
-   **Risks/benefits:** Transferred to the [[Lessee|lessee]]. Lessee pays maintenance, insurance, and taxes.
