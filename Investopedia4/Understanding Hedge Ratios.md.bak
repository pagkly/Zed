[[Understanding Hedge Ratios]]
## What Is the [[Hedge]] Ratio?

The [[Hedge|hedge]] ratio compares the value of a position protected through the use of a [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) with the size of the entire position itself. A hedge ratio may also be a comparison of the value of [[futures contracts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp) purchased or sold to the value of the cash commodity being hedged.

[[Futures]] contracts are essentially investment vehicles that let the investor lock in a price for a physical asset at some point in the future.

The [[Hedge|hedge]] ratio is the hedged position divided by the total position.

## How the [[Hedge]] Ratio Works

Imagine you are holding $10,000 in foreign [[Equity|equity]], which exposes you to [[currency risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyrisk.asp). You could enter into a [[Hedge|hedge]] to protect against losses in this position, which can be constructed through a variety of positions to take an offsetting position to the foreign equity investment.

If you [[Hedge|hedge]] $5,000 worth of the [[Equity|equity]] with a currency position, your hedge ratio is 0.5 ($5,000 / $10,000). This means that 50% of your foreign equity investment is sheltered from currency [[Risk|risk]].

## Types of [[Hedge]] Ratio

The minimum variance [[Hedge|hedge]] ratio is important when [[cross-hedging]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crosshedge.asp), which aims to minimize the variance of the position's value. The minimum variance hedge ratio, or optimal hedge ratio, is an important factor in determining the optimal number of [[Futures|futures]] contracts to purchase to hedge a position.

It is calculated as the product of the [[correlation coefficient]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlationcoefficient.asp) between the changes in the spot and [[Futures|futures]] prices and the ratio of the [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) of the changes in the spot price to the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the futures price. After calculating the optimal [[Hedge|hedge]] ratio, the optimal number of contracts needed to hedge a position is calculated by dividing the product of the optimal hedge ratio and the units of the position being hedged by the size of one futures contract.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Hedge|hedge]] ratio compares the amount of a position that is hedged to the entire position.
-   The minimum variance [[Hedge|hedge]] ratio helps determine the optimal number of options contracts needed to hedge a position.
-   The minimum variance [[Hedge|hedge]] ratio is important in cross-hedging, which aims to minimize the variance of a position's value.

## Example of the [[Hedge]] Ratio

Assume that an airline company fears that the price of jet fuel [[Will|will]] rise after the [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] market has been trading at depressed levels. The airline company expects to purchase 15 million gallons of jet fuel over the next year, and wishes to [[Hedge|hedge]] its [[Purchase Price|purchase price]]. Assume that the [[Correlation|correlation]] between crude oil [[Futures|futures]] and the spot price of jet fuel is 0.95, which is a high degree of correlation.

Further assume the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] [[Futures|futures]] and spot jet fuel price is 6% and 3%, respectively. Therefore, the minimum variance [[Hedge|hedge]] ratio is 0.475, or (0.95 \* (3% / 6%)). The NYMEX [[Western Texas Intermediate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wti.asp) (WTI) crude oil futures contract has a contract size of 1,000 barrels or 42,000 gallons. The optimal number of contracts is calculated to be 170 contracts, or (0.475 \* 15 million) / 42,000. Therefore, the airline company would purchase 170 NYMEX WTI crude oil futures contracts.
