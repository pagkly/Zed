# [[Turnover Ratio]] Definition

> ## Excerpt
> [[Turnover Ratio|Turnover ratio]] depicts how much of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] has been replaced in a year. Some vehicles, such as bond funds and small-cap [[Stock|stock]] funds, have naturally high turnover ratios. Passively managed vehicles, like index funds, tend to have low turnover ratios.

[[Turnover Ratio]]
## What Is [[Turnover Ratio]]?

The [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] or turnover rate is the percentage of a mutual fund or other [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s [[Holdings|holdings]] that have been replaced in a given year (calendar year or whichever 12-month period represents the fund's fiscal year).

For example, a mutual fund that invests in 100 [[Stocks|stocks]] and replaces 50 stocks during one year has a [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] of 50%. Some funds [[Hold|hold]] their [[Equity|equity]] positions for less than 12 months, meaning their turnover ratios exceed 100%.

If a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] exceeds 100%, it doesn't necessarily mean that every single holding has been replaced, however. The ratio seeks to reflect the proportion of [[Stocks|stocks]] that have changed in one year.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] varies by the type of mutual fund, its investment objective, and/or the [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]]'s investing style.
-   The [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] or turnover rate is the percentage of a mutual fund or other [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s [[Holdings|holdings]] that have been replaced in a given year.
-   Funds with high turnover ratios might incur greater costs (trading fees, commissions) and generate short-term capital gains, which are taxable at an investor's [[ordinary-income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp) rate.1

## Understanding [[Turnover Ratio]]

The [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] varies by the type of [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp), its [[investment objective]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentobjective.asp), and/or the [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]]'s [[investing style]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstyle.asp). For example, a [[Stock|stock]] market [[index fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) usually [[Will|will]] have a low turnover rate since it duplicates a particular index, and the component companies in indexes don't change that often. On the other hand, a [[bond fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondfund.asp) will often have high turnover because [[active trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/active-trading.asp) is an inherent quality of bond investments.

Actively managed mutual funds with a low [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] reflect a buy-and-[[Hold|hold]] investment strategy; those with high turnover ratios indicate an attempt to profit by a market-timing approach. An aggressive small-cap [[growth stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp) fund [[Will|will]] generally experience higher turnover than a large-cap [[value stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuestock.asp) fund.

## The Significance of [[Turnover Ratio]]

As a [[technical indicator,]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp) the [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] itself has no intrinsic value—high turnover ratios are not necessarily "bad," nor are low turnover ratios necessarily "good." But investors should be aware of the consequences of turnover frequency. High turnover often results in increased costs for the fund due to the payment of [[spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp) and commissions when buying and selling [[Stocks|stocks]]; increased costs impact a fund's [[Return|return]] overall. Also, the more [[portfolio turnover]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolioturnover.asp) in a fund, the more likely it [[Will|will]] generate short-term capital gains, which are taxable at an investor's [[ordinary-income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp) rate.1

A mutual fund's [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] shouldn't be the sole basis of a decision to invest or devest in it. However, it can be useful to see how a particular fund's turnover ratio compares with others of the same type of investment approach. For example, the average turnover ratio for managed mutual funds is 75–115%.2 So a conservative-minded [[Equity|equity]] investor might target funds with turnover ratios under 50%.

If a fund's [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] is significantly out of line with that of comparable funds, that might be something to note. Say that most funds following a particular index have turnover ratios around 5%, and one fund posted 25% turnover in one year. In this instance, investors might want to ask why: Did a new [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] come in and clean house? Was there some change in the fund objective? Conversely, say that most Pacific Rim [[Equity|equity]] funds have 75% turnover ratios, but there is one with a ratio of 35%: Is management there asleep at the wheel?

## Real-World Examples of [[Turnover Ratio]]

The BNY Mellon Appreciation Fund from Fidelity (DGAGX) has a strong buy-and-[[Hold|hold]] strategy in mostly blue-chip companies with total market capitalizations of over $5 billion at the time of purchase. Those companies show sustained profitability, strong [[balance sheets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp), global expansion, and above-average earnings growth, in keeping with the fund's objective of capital preservation. As of year-end 2019, the fund's [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] was 4.73%.3

In contrast, Fidelity's Rydex S&P Small-Cap 600 Pure [[Growth Fund]] (RYSGX) invests in the [[Common Stock|common stock]] of companies within the capitalization range of the [[Underlying|underlying]] S&P Small-Cap 600 Index and [[Derivative|derivative]] instruments. At least 80% of the fund’s net assets are invested in fast-growing companies or firms in up-and-coming industries, and it seeks to match the index's performance on a daily basis. At the end of March 2020, the Rydex fund had an average [[Turnover Ratio|turnover ratio]] of 628%.4
