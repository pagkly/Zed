[[What Are Weak Longs]]?
## [[What Are Weak Longs]]?

Weak longs are investors who [[Hold|hold]] a [[long]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) position and are quick to exit that position at the first sign of weakness. This type of investor is typically trying to capture [[Upside|upside]] potential in a given [[Security|security]] but is not willing to take much loss. These investors [[Will|will]] quickly [[close]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp) their positions when a trade does not move in their favor.

## Understanding Weak Longs

Weak longs are often short-term traders rather than long-term [[investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) because they are unwilling to [[Hold|hold]] their positions through market fluctuations. If a trade does not move in their favor, they [[Will|will]] quickly close their positions and look elsewhere for opportunities. Most weak longs are [[Momentum|momentum]] traders who are more interested in making a quick profit than investing in [[undervalued]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp) companies until they reach a [[Fair Value|fair value]].

When weak longs close their position, it may present an opportunity for investors to [[buy into the dip]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-the-dips.asp) and reduce their cost basis. The selling pressure that weak longs create when closing out their positions can lead to consolidation in a [[Stock|stock]] following a significant uptrend. This explains why [[Stocks|stocks]] tend to top out after following an [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) announcement because these traders lock in their profits and move on to other investment opportunities.

The benefit of a weak long is that the investor can lock in profits immediately rather than succumbing to cognitive biases such as the [[disposition]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Disposition|disposition]].asp) effect – or holding onto a losing [[Stock|stock]] for too long. The drawback is that weak longs tend to generate substantial churn in their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] and it can be harder to remain profitable over the [[Long Term|long term]] compared to a strategy of long-term investing.

## Example of Weak Longs

Suppose that a company announces favorable earnings for the quarter. Short-term traders may buy the [[Stock|stock]] at the open to capitalize on the run-up while long-term investors may add the stock to their existing positions. Weak longs [[Will|will]] [[Hold|hold]] the stock until it begins to [[consolidate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp) following an earnings run-up. At that point, they may sell the stock and move on to other opportunities. Long-term investors will continue holding the stock over the [[Long Term|long term]].

In addition, long-term investors may take advantage of the consolidation to add to their position and lower their cost basis. Long-term investors may wait on the sidelines following a positive [[Earnings Announcement|earnings announcement]] and buy the [[Stock|stock]] after it begins to move lower and consolidate. This allows them to buy the stock at a lower price after the dust has settled and ultimately increase their long-term profit potential.
