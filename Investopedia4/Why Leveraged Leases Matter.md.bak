[[Why Leveraged Leases Matter]]
## What Is a Leveraged [[Lease]]?

A leveraged [[Lease|lease]] is a [lease](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lease.asp) agreement that is financed through the [lessor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lessor|lessor]].asp) with help from a third-party [[financial institution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp). In a leveraged lease, an [[asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/what-is-an-asset.asp) is rented with borrowed funds.

## Understanding Leveraged Leases

Leveraged leases are most often used in the renting of assets planned for short-term use. Assets like cars, trucks, construction vehicles and business equipment are typically all available through the option of leveraged leasing. Leasing in general means a company or individual [[Will|will]] be renting an asset.

Leasing any type of asset gives an entity the right to use the asset for a short-term. In general, the entity is only renting the asset although many [[leveraged leases]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080113/understanding-[[Leverage|leverage]]-ratios.asp) [[Offer|offer]] a buyout option at the end of the [[Lease|lease]] term.

The leveraged aspect of a leveraged [[Lease|lease]] involves borrowing funds to pay for the high cost of the asset’s value. A leveraged lease is usually used when an entity does not have the funds to buy the asset outright nor do they necessarily want to keep the asset for a long-term. A leveraged lease allows a [[Lessee|lessee]] to obtain a [[Loan|loan]] for the leased asset’s value during the lease term and repay the loan over the life of the lease. The amount needed for the loan can be lower than buying the asset outright because the lessee is only paying for a specified value associated with the length of time on the lease.

Accounting standards require a business to differentiate and account for leased assets differently depending on whether the [[Lease|lease]] is an operating lease or leveraged/capital lease.

### [[Leverage]] [[Lease]] Structure

[[Leverage]] leases can be more complex than a basic operating [[Lease|lease]] because leverage is involved. The structure of the leveraged lease terms [[Will|will]] depend on the [[Lessor|lessor]] and their financing relationships. The lessor may also be the financing institution who provides the [[Loan|loan]] in which case they approve the loan for the borrower.

The [[Lessor|lessor]] may also work with a [[Third Party|third party]] [[Lender|lender]]. In this case, the third-party lender provides the borrowed funds to the lessor on your behalf allowing you to take possession of the asset as soon as a [[Loan|loan]] is approved. In some cases, a lessor may put up some funds combined with borrowed funds from a third party which can help to improve the overall terms of the [[Lease|lease]].

Once a leveraged [[Lease|lease]] is approved and agreed on, the borrower takes possession of the asset and is responsible for making regularly scheduled payments toward the [[loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Loan|loan]].asp) balance. The asset’s title is usually held by either the [[Lessor|lessor]] or the [[Lender|lender]] depending on the structure. Regardless, a leveraged lease doesn’t involve the transfer of the title to the [[Lessee|lessee]] during the lease period.

Keep in mind that a leveraged [[Lease|lease]] is usually backed by a secured [[Loan|loan]]. This means that if a [[Lessee|lessee]] stops making payments, the [[Lessor|lessor]] can repossess the asset.

## Leasing vs. Financing

Leveraged leasing and leveraged financing are typically the two main options for any person or company buying a car or other high-value asset. A leveraged [[Lease|lease]] provides a [[Loan|loan]] that covers an estimated value of a car over the leasing timeframe. Leveraged lease payments can potentially be lower because the loan does not cover the full value of the car.

An entity can also have the option to [[Finance|finance]] a car, in this scenario the car [[Loan|loan]] is similar to a home loan. The buyer of the car obtains a loan for the full value of the car and payments are created over a longer timeframe for repaying the car loan.

### Key Takeaways

-   Leveraged leases allow an entity to rent an asset for a specified amount of time using borrowed funds.
-   A leveraged [[Lease|lease]] is usually used when an entity does not have the funds to buy the asset outright nor do they necessarily want to keep the asset for a long-term.
-   In business accounting, a leveraged [[Lease|lease]] is referred to as a capital lease and specific accounting standards are required.

## Special Considerations: Accounting for Leveraged Leases

Individuals usually do not need to worry about the accounting standards for leasing an asset with [[Leverage|leverage]] but this would be a factor for a business. In business accounting, leveraged leases are referred to as [[capital leases]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitallease.asp).

To determine the difference, four criteria are used:

-   The life of the [[Lease|lease]] is 75% or more of the asset's [useful life](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usefullife.asp).
-   The [[Lease|lease]] includes a bargain purchase option whereby the [[Lessee|lessee]] can purchase the asset at a lower price in the future than its [[Fair Value|fair value]].
-   The [[Lessee|lessee]] gains ownership at the end of the [[Lease|lease]] period.
-   The present value of the [[Lease|lease]] payments is greater than 90% of the asset's market value.

If any one of these criteria is met, then the [[Lease|lease]] is considered a capital lease and if not then the lease is considered an operating lease. Capital leases generally involve accounting for the leased asset similarly to an asset purchase. Operating lease accounting [[Will|will]] generally require entries for the lease payments as operating expenses.

## Operating [[Lease]] vs. Leveraged/Capital Lease

Individuals or business entities may encounter the differences in an operating [[Lease|lease]] vs. a leveraged/capital lease. In general, an operating lease does not include any options for buying the asset being rented. Common types of operating lease agreements include apartment leases and building leases.

Leveraged/capital leases are important to differentiate from operating leases in business accounting since accounting principles have different standards for the two.
