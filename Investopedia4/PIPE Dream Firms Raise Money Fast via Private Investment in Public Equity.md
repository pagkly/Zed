PIPE Dream: Firms Raise Money Fast via Private Investment in Public [[Equity]]
## What Is a Private Investment in Public [[Equity]] (PIPE)?

Private investment in public [[Equity|equity]] (PIPE) is the buying of [[Shares|shares]] of publicly traded [[Stock|stock]] at a price below the [[current market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmv.asp) (CMV) per share. This buying method is a practice of investment firms, [[mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp), and other large, [[accredited investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp). A traditional PIPE is one in which common or [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] is issued at a set price to the [[investor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp), while a structured PIPE issues common or preferred shares of convertible [[Debt|debt]].

The purpose of a PIPE is for the issuer of the [[Stock|stock]] to raise capital for the public company. This financing technique is more efficient than [[secondary offerings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp) due to fewer regulatory issues with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC).

### Key Takeaways

-   Private investment in public [[Equity|equity]] (PIPE) is when an institutional or an accredited investor buys [[Stock|stock]] directly from a public company below market price.
-   Because they have less stringent regulatory requirements than public offerings, PIPEs save companies time and money and raise funds more quickly.
-   The discounted price of PIPE [[Shares|shares]] means less capital for the company, and their issuance effectively dilutes the current stockholders' stake.

## How a Private Investment in Public [[Equity]] Works

A publicly-traded company may utilize a PIPE when securing funds for [[working capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp) to fund day-to-day operations, expansion, or [[acquisitions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp). The company may create new [[Stock|stock]] [[Shares|shares]] or use some from its [[Supply|supply]], but the equities never go on sale on a stock exchange.

Instead, these large investors purchase the company's [[Stock|stock]] in a [[private placement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateplacement.asp), and the issuer files a resale registration statement with the SEC.

The issuing business typically obtains its funding—that is, the investors' money for the [[Shares|shares]]—within two to three weeks, rather than waiting several months or longer, as it would with a secondary [[Stock|stock]] [[Offering|offering]]. Registration of the new shares with the SEC typically becomes effective within a month of filing.

## Special Considerations for PIPE Buyers

PIPE investors may purchase [[Stock|stock]] below the market price as a [[Hedge|hedge]] of protection against the share price going down after news of the PIPE gets out. The discount also acts as compensation for a certain lack of [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) in the [[Shares|shares]], meaning there can be delays in selling or converting the shares to cash.

Since this [[Offering|offering]] was a PIPE, the buyers cannot sell their [[Shares|shares]] until the company files its resale registration statement with the SEC. However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding [[Stock|stock]] at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders.

A traditional PIPE agreement lets investors purchase [[common stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp) or [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) that is convertible to common [[Shares|shares]] at a predetermined price or exchange rate. If the business is merged with another or sold soon, investors may be able to receive dividends or other payoffs. Dividends are cash or [[Stock|stock]] payments from companies to their shareholders or investors. Because of these benefits, traditional PIPEs are typically priced at or near the stock’s market value.

With a structured PIPE, [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] or [[Debt|debt]] securities convertible to [[Common Stock|common stock]] are sold. If the securities contain a reset clause, new investors are shielded from downside risks, but existing stockholders are exposed to the greater [[Risk|risk]] of [[dilution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp) in share values. For this reason, a structured PIPE transaction may need prior stockholder approval.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of PIPEs

Private investment in public [[Equity|equity]] carries several advantages for issuers. Large amounts of [[Shares|shares]] are typically sold to knowledgeable investors over the [[Long Term|long term]], ensuring the company secures the funding it needs. PIPEs can be particularly advantageous for small-to-medium-sized [[public companies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp) that may have a hard time accessing [[more traditional forms of equity financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030415/difference-between-private-and-public-equity.asp).

Because PIPE [[Shares|shares]] do not need to be registered in advance with the SEC or meet all the usual federal registration requirements for public [[Stock|stock]] offerings, transactions proceed more efficiently with fewer administrative requirements.

However, on the downside, investors may sell their [[Stock|stock]] in a short amount of time, driving down the market price. If the market price drops below a set threshold, the company may have to issue additional stock at a significantly reduced price. This new share issue dilutes the value of shareholders’ investments, which can lead to a lower stock price.

[Short sellers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) may take advantage of the situation by repeatedly selling their [[Shares|shares]] and lowering the share price, potentially resulting in PIPE investors having majority ownership of the company. Setting a minimum share price below which no compensatory [[Stock|stock]] is issued can avoid this problem.

## Real-World Example of a PIPE

In February 2018, Yum! Brands(YUM), the owner of Taco Bell and KFC, announced it was [[purchasing $200 million]](https://investors.grubhub.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Yum-Brands-and-Grubhub-Announce-New-US-Growth-Partnership/[[Default|default]].aspx) of takeout company GrubHub's [[Stock|stock]] through a PIPE. In this case, Yum! drove the PIPE to forge a stronger partnership between the two companies to increase sales at its restaurants through pickups and delivery.

The added [[Liquidity|liquidity]] allowed GrubHub to grow its U.S. delivery network and to create a more seamless ordering experience for customers of both companies. GrubHub also expanded its board of directors from nine to 10, adding a representative from Yum!
