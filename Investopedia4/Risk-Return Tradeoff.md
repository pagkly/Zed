[[Risk-Return Tradeoff]]
## What is [[Risk-Return Tradeoff]]?

The [[Risk-Return Tradeoff|risk-return tradeoff]] states that the potential [[Return|return]] rises with an increase in [[Risk|risk]]. Using this principle, individuals associate low levels of uncertainty with low potential returns, and high levels of uncertainty or risk with high potential returns. According to the risk-return tradeoff, invested money can render higher profits only if the investor [[Will|will]] [[accept a higher possibility of losses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roys-safety-first-criterion.asp).

## Understanding [[Risk-Return Tradeoff]]

The [[Risk-Return Tradeoff|risk-return tradeoff]] is the trading principle that links high [[Risk|risk]] with high reward. The appropriate risk-[[Return|return]] tradeoff depends on a variety of factors including an investor’s risk tolerance, the investor’s years to retirement and the potential to replace lost funds. Time also plays an essential role in determining a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] with the appropriate levels of risk and reward. For example, if an investor has the ability to invest in equities over the [[long term]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longterm.asp), that provides the investor with the potential to recover from the risks of bear markets and participate in bull markets, while if an investor can only invest in a short time frame, the same equities have a higher risk proposition.

Investors use the [[Risk-Return Tradeoff|risk-return tradeoff]] as one of the essential components of each investment decision, as well as to assess their portfolios as a whole. At the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] level, the [[Risk|risk]]-[[Return|return]] tradeoff can include assessments of the concentration or the diversity of [[holdings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Holdings|holdings]].asp) and whether the mix presents too much risk or a lower-than-desired potential for returns.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Risk-Return Tradeoff|risk-return tradeoff]] is an investment principle that indicates that the higher the [[Risk|risk]], the higher the potential reward.
-   To calculate an appropriate [[Risk-Return Tradeoff|risk-return tradeoff]], investors must consider many factors, including overall [[Risk|risk]] tolerance, the potential to replace lost funds and more.
-   Investors consider the [[Risk-Return Tradeoff|risk-return tradeoff]] on individual investments and across portfolios when making investment decisions.

## Special Considerations

### Measuring Singular [[Risk]] in Context

When an investor considers high-[[Risk|risk]]-high-[[Return|return]] investments, the investor can apply the [[Risk-Return Tradeoff|risk-return tradeoff]] to the [[vehicle]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentvehicle.asp) on a singular basis as well as within the context of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] as a whole. Examples of high-risk-high return investments include options, penny [[Stocks|stocks]] and leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Generally speaking, a diversified portfolio reduces the risks presented by individual investment positions. For example, a [[penny stock position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp) may have a high risk on a singular basis, but if it is the only position of its kind in a larger portfolio, the risk incurred by holding the [[Stock|stock]] is minimal.

### [[Risk-Return Tradeoff]] at the [[Portfolio]] Level

That said, the [[Risk-Return Tradeoff|risk-return tradeoff]] also exists at the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] level. For example, a portfolio composed of all [[equities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) presents both higher [[Risk|risk]] and higher potential returns. Within an all-equity portfolio, risk and reward can be increased by concentrating investments in specific [[sectors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector.asp) or by taking on single positions that represent a large percentage of [[Holdings|holdings]]. For investors, assessing the cumulative risk-[[Return|return]] tradeoff of all positions can provide insight on whether a portfolio assumes enough risk to achieve long-term return objectives or if the risk levels are too high with the existing mix of holdings.
