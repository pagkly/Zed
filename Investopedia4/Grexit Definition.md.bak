[[Grexit Definition]]
## What is Grexit?

Grexit, an abbreviation for "Greek exit," refers to Greece's potential withdrawal from the [[Euro-zone]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Eurozone|eurozone]].asp), and a [[Return|return]] to the Drachma as its official currency instead of the [[Euro]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   Grexit, an abbreviation for "Greek exit," refers to Greece's potential withdrawal from the Euro-zone, and a [[Return|return]] to the Drachma as its official currency instead of the Euro.
-   Grexit, as a viable solution to the country's [[Debt|debt]] crisis, gained notoriety in early 2012 and has been in the financial vernacular ever since.
-   The Greek government rejected Grexit and instead received multiple rounds of bailout loans from the euro-zone in addition to implementing austerity measures.

## Understanding Grexit

Grexit gained notoriety in early 2012, and has been in the financial vernacular ever since, when many pundits, and even some Greek citizens, floated the idea that Greece should withdraw from the Euro-zone as a viable solution to the country’s [[debt crisis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-sovereign-[[Debt|debt]]-crisis.asp).

Leaving the Euro and bringing back the [[Greek drachma]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greek-drachma.asp) was thought to be a way to allow Greece to recover from the brink of bankruptcy. A devalued drachma was considered as a way to encourage overseas investment and allow other Europeans to visit Greece on the cheap by paying in more-expensive Euro. In this way, proponents argued that the Greek economy would suffer in the near term, but could eventually recover with far less assistance from other [[Eurozone|eurozone]] countries and the [[International Monetary Fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imf.asp) (IMF), perhaps even quicker than via eurozone bailouts.

However, opponents argued that a [[Return|return]] to the drachma would lead to a very rough economic transition and far-lower [[living standards]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/standard-of-living-quality-of-life.asp), which could result in even more civil unrest. Some in Europe worried that Grexit could even cause Greece to embrace other foreign powers that might not align with the interests of the [[Eurozone|eurozone]].

Opponents to Grexit have seemingly won out, at least in the years since Grexit entered the discussion. As of 2020, Greece remains in the [[Eurozone|eurozone]], with help from bailout loans in 2010, 2012, and 2015.1 However, the term Grexit has continued to make headlines on occasion. Even though Greece continues to attract [[Foreign Investment|foreign investment]] and has implemented austerity measures, some have argued that Grexit remains an eventual possibility.

## Origins of Greece's [[Debt]] Crisis

Grexit points to [decades-old problems](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/061115/origins-greeces-[[Debt|debt]]-crisis.asp) in Greece such as high government debt, [[Tax Evasion|tax evasion]], and government corruption. Greece first joined the [[Eurozone|eurozone]] in 2001, but its government revealed just three years later that economic data was falsified so the country would [[Gain|gain]] entry.1

When the global [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] struck, it laid bare many of Greece’s structural problems. Greece’s [[gross domestic product]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) (GDP) shrank by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2009, and the deficit ballooned to more than 12% of GDP.2 The country subsequently suffered a string of credit-[[Rating|rating]] downgrades culminating in Standard & Poor’s demoting Greece’s [[Debt|debt]] to [[junk status]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp), which caused the country’s [[bond yields]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-[[Yield|yield]].asp) to soar, reflecting the severe financial instability.3

## Austerity and Bailouts

In exchange for receiving multiple bailouts to avoid bankruptcy, Greece had to agree to [[austerity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/austerity.asp) measures. The first round of austerity in 2010 cut public-sector wages, raised the minimum retirement age, and increased fuel prices. Subsequent measures over the following three years reduced public-sector pay further, cut Greece’s [[minimum wage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp), reduced pension payouts, gutted defense spending, and raised taxes. As a result, [[Unemployment|unemployment]] rose to nearly 28% in the fall of 2013, far higher than the 11% average for the Euro-zone as a whole.4

One criticism of the [[bailouts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bailout.asp) has been that little of the money has gone to help Greek citizens directly. Rather, it has mostly passed through Greece and helped to repay Greece’s [[Debt|debt]]-holders, most of which are banks in other European countries. Germany, for example, has been the largest contributor to Greece’s bailout packages, and its banks also are the largest investors in Greek bonds.5

## Greek Recovery

The economic and financial uncertainty in Greece has improved markedly since the worst days of the crisis. In Aug. 2018, government officials announced the country had successfully exited the last of its bailout programs.1 Ending the bailout programs allowed Greece to begin selling [10-year bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) in 2019 for the first time in nine years. This event marks a milestone in Greece's recovery as it allows the country to raise money and continue its long journey to regain economic sovereignty.6
