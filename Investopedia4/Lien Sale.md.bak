[[Lien Sale]]
## What Is a [[Lien Sale]]?

A [[Lien Sale|lien sale]] is the sale of the claim—or a [[Hold|hold]]—placed on an asset to satisfy an unpaid [[Debt|debt]]. Typically, [[Lien|lien]] sales are conducted as public [[auctions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auction.asp), and the lien is on real [[Estate|estate]], automobiles, and other [[Personal Property|personal property]].

Depending on a particular state's laws, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers may put a [[Lien|lien]] on a piece of property they have worked on pending payment for services rendered.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Lien Sale|lien sale]] is the sale of the claim, or a [[Hold|hold]] placed on an asset, to satisfy an unpaid [[Debt|debt]].
-   Notices for [[Lien|lien]] sales might be posted online by the overseeing local agency as well as in local newspapers.
-   There are limits to the interest rate amounts that a [[Lien|lien]] buyer can impose.

## How a [[Lien Sale]] Works

Buying [[delinquent]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delinquent.asp) tax liens at a sale is becoming an increasingly popular form of investing and is similar to purchasing a long-term [[Certificate of Deposit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) (CD). However, unlike a CD, tax-liens cannot be sold back to the taxing authority and must be held until they are repaid. Redemption of the purchased [[Lien|lien]] is typically at a given rate of [[Return|return]] within a specified time frame.

[[Lien]] sales for unpaid debts on a property can result in the amount owed increasing further. When the lien [[Debt|debt]] is sold, usually by a local government agency, the buyer can employ a lien servicing company that may add more fees and interest to the lien. This allows the buyer to see a [[Return|return]] on their investment as the [[Debtor|debtor]] must now pay the additional costs imposed.

In many instances, several notices of an impending [[Lien Sale|lien sale]] [[Will|will]] be sent to the [[Debtor|debtor]] before a notice is filed stating the approaching date for the auction.

Although a [[Debtor|debtor]] may owe taxes and other fees, there can be exceptions that [[Will|will]] shelter their property and other assets from being subject to a [[Lien Sale|lien sale]]. For example, disabled homeowners, senior citizens, and veterans could receive exemptions.

Active duty military personnel might also be eligible for an exemption for [[Lien|lien]] sales on their property. Each jurisdiction [[Will|will]] have its own criteria, application process, and window of time when the responsible agency must be contacted.

Buying a home with a [[Lien|lien]] on it is not without complications.

There are limits to the interest rate amounts that a [[Lien|lien]] buyer can impose. Interest rate limits are set at the government level and vary by state. The bidding process is auction style, with the winner being the highest bidder. Because there is a limit to the maximum interest rate a winning bidder can charge, the amount the buyer pays for the lien is paramount.

## Example of [[Lien Sale]]

As an example, if the maximum interest rate that can be charged for a [[Lien|lien]] is 12%, it is a good idea to put a limit on your highest bid. The lower the winning bid, the better. Since this is competitive, a buyer wants to limit the [[Risk|risk]] of not being paid back in a timely fashion.

Said simply, paying a 2% [[Premium|premium]] for the ability to charge up to a 12% interest rate is a lot better than paying a 9% premium.

## Special Considerations

Owners of property that is subject to a [[Lien Sale|lien sale]] can have their property removed from such sale by making payment arrangements to bring their outstanding [[Debt|debt]] up to date.

There may be special procedures for different types of [[Lien|lien]] sales, such as an auction for a vehicle of a certain value. How that is handled can differ from a [[Lien Sale|lien sale]] for the contents of a self-storage unit if the owner fails to pay their bills to the storage company on time.

Notices for [[Lien|lien]] sales might be posted online by the overseeing local agency or in local newspapers.
