## How National Banks Work

National banks in both the U.S. and worldwide have an important role in shaping a country's [[financial system]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-system.asp). Having an efficient banking system, whether through a [[central bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) or the U.S. Federal Reserve, is critical for financial stability especially during times of recession or weathering downturns in the economy.

National banks may facilitate daily transactions with their local Federal Reserve Bank (also called a Fed), such as Fed [[bank wires]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankwire.asp). National banks must generate call reports to the Fed each quarter and ensure these reports are made public. As mentioned above, national banks in the United States are typically commercial banks, the largest of which include Chase Bank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank. U.S. Bank, PNC Bank, Capital One, and others.

Hamilton’s aim with these measures was to establish financial order, national credit, and resolve the issue of [[fiat currency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).
