[[Net Liquid Assets]]
## What Are [[Net Liquid Assets]]?

[[Net Liquid Assets|Net liquid assets]] are a measure of an immediate or near-term [[Liquidity|liquidity]] position of a firm, calculated as [[liquid assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp) less [[current liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp). Liquid assets are cash, [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]], and accounts receivables that can be readily converted to cash at their approximate current value.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Net Liquid Assets|Net liquid assets]] are a measure of the near-term [[Liquidity|liquidity]] position of a firm, calculated as liquid assets less current liabilities.
-   Liquid assets include cash, [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]], and accounts receivables. They are any assets that can be quickly converted into cash.
-   Having a net [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]] position signifies a company is in good health and is able to pay its short-term obligations, such as paying suppliers and paying down short-term [[Debt|debt]].
-   A net [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]] position also demonstrates that a company can make new investments without having to take on financing.
-   Having too many liquid assets, however, demonstrates an idle use of cash, whereby the money could be put to better use, such as other investments or paying out dividends.

## Understanding [[Net Liquid Assets]]

The amount of [[Net Liquid Assets|net liquid assets]] is one of a few measures that gives a snapshot of the financial condition of a firm. Cash and [[marketable securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketablesecurities.asp) are ready to deploy, while accounts receivables could be turned into cash within a short period of time, though perhaps not completely as there is typically a small percentage of [[bad debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baddebt.asp) associated with aged receivables. [[Inventory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp) does not qualify as a [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]] because it cannot be readily sold without a significant discount.

Current liabilities mainly encompass accounts payable, accrued liabilities, income tax payable, and a current portion of [[long-term debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermdebt.asp) for the average company. Subtracting current liabilities from the above liquid assets shows the financial flexibility of a company to make a quick payment.

## Advantages of [[Net Liquid Assets]]

Having a strong net [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]] position is important for a firm because it demonstrates that a firm is able to pay off its short-term obligations, such as paying suppliers and paying off [[short-term debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp). It also signifies that a company is able to make new investments, such as the purchase of equipment, without having to take on [[financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp).

Companies that have a strong net [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]] position are also better placed in times of economic downturns. They are in a position to weather the storm by relying on its liquid assets to continue paying its short-term obligations even if business is not booming.

On the other hand, a company that does not have a strong net [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]] position and no significant revenues in an economic downturn [[Will|will]] not be able to meet its obligations and may have to declare [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp).

Having [[Net Liquid Assets|net liquid assets]] also makes it easier to receive financing from a bank as it demonstrates the ability of a company to pay off its loans, even in times of distress. This also results in usually receiving a better [[interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) on a [[Loan|loan]].

Though having [[Net Liquid Assets|net liquid assets]] is a positive position to be in, having too many liquid assets is not the most beneficial use of cash, as it could be invested and earning a [[Return|return]] elsewhere, rather than sitting idly in a bank account. Conversely, it can also be used to pay [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) to [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp).

There is a fine balance that a company must strike between enough liquid assets and too many liquid assets. The general [[Rule Of Thumb|rule of thumb]] is that if a business has six months of liquid assets to meet short-term obligations and cover [[operating expenses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp), it is in a good position financially.

## Real World Example

The Container Store Group, Inc. as of Dec. 30, 2017, had the following components on its balance sheet for [[current assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp) and current liabilities:

[[Current Assets]]

-   Cash: $22.7 million
-   Accounts Receivables: $29.5 million
-   Inventory: $110.5 million
-   Prepaid Expenses: $11.7 million
-   Income Tax Receivable: $1.5 million
-   Other [[Current Assets]]: $10.3 million

Current Liabilities

-   Accounts Payable: $53.8 million
-   Accrued Liabilities: $73.5 million
-   Current Portion of Long-Term [[Debt]]: $9.5 million
-   Income Tax Payable: $1.7 million

[[Net Liquid Assets|Net liquid assets]] as of this date would be Cash + Accounts Receivables - Current Liabilities = $22.7 million + $29.5 million - $138.5 million = -$86.3 million. The negative net liquid position of the company may be a concern, but this situation is typical for a retailer. Still, it indicates that the company is not in the best financial position, particularly if the economy takes a turn for the worse.
