[[Weighted Average Cost of Equity (WACE)]]
## What is the [[Weighted Average Cost of Equity (WACE)]]?

[[Weighted Average Cost of Equity (WACE)|Weighted average cost of equity (WACE)]] is a way to calculate the cost of a company's [[Equity|equity]] that gives different weight to different types of equities according to their proportion in the corporate structure. Instead of lumping [[retained earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp), [[Common Stock|common stock]], and [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] together, WACE provides a more accurate idea of a company's total [[cost of equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofequity.asp).

Determining an accurate [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] for a firm is integral for the firm to be able to calculate its [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp). In turn, an accurate measure of the [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] is essential when a firm is trying to decide if a future project [[Will|will]] be profitable or not.

## How the [[Weighted Average Cost of Equity (WACE)]] Works

The [[Weighted Average Cost of Equity (WACE)|weighted average cost of equity (WACE)]] is essentially the same as the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] that relates to the [[Capital Asset Pricing Model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp) (CAPM). Rather than simply averaging out the cost of [[Equity|equity]], a weighting is applied that reflects the mix of that equity type in the company at the time. If the cost of equity was averaged without being [[Weighted|weighted]], outliers in the cost of equity could cause an overstatement or understatement of the cost.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Weighted Average Cost of Equity (WACE)|weighted average cost of equity (WACE)]] measures the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] proportionally for a company rather than simply averaging the overall figures.
-   With the [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]], the cost of a particular [[Equity|equity]] type is multiplied by the percentage of the capital structure it represents.
-   The [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] used in most formulas is usually a [[Weighted|weighted]] average cost of [[Equity|equity]], even if this is not explicitly stated.

## Calculating the [[Weighted Average Cost of Equity (WACE)]]

Calculating the [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] isn't as straightforward as calculating the [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]]. First, you must calculate the cost of new [[Common Stock|common stock]], the cost of [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], and the cost of [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] separately. The most common way to do this is the CAPM formula:

[[Cost of Equity|Cost of equity]] = [[Risk free rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]]-freerate.asp) + \[[beta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) x (market rate of [[Return|return]] – risk-free rate of return)\]

Generally speaking, the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] for [[Common Stock|common stock]], [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], and [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] [[Will|will]] usually be within a tight range. For this example, let us assume the cost of common [[Stock|stock]], preferred stock, and retained earnings are 14%, 12% and 11%, respectively.

Now, calculate the portion of total [[Equity|equity]] that is occupied by each form of equity. Again, let us assume this is 50%, 25% and 25%, for [[Common Stock|common stock]], [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] and [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]], respectively.

Finally, multiply the cost of each form of [[Equity|equity]] by its respective portion of total equity and sum of the values, which results in the WACE. Our example results in a WACE of 19.5%.

WACE = (.14 x .50) + (.12 x .25) + (.11 x .25) = 0.1275 or 12.8%

Simply averaging the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] across categories in the example above would have yielded a cost of [[Equity|equity]] of 12.3%. That said, averaging is rarely done as the [[Weighted|weighted]] average cost of equity is usually used as part of the larger calculation of a company's [[weighted average cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) (WACC).

## Why the [[Weighted Average Cost of Equity (WACE)]] Matters

Potential buyers who are considering acquiring a company might use the [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] to help them assign a value to the future cash flows of the target company. The results of this formula can also be coupled with other indicators, such as the after-tax [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]] to form an assessment. As mentioned, the weighted average cost of [[Equity|equity]] is commonly combined with the weighted average cost of [[Debt|debt]] to calculated a firm's weighted average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] (WACC).

As part of the WACC, the WACE is used within the company to better assess how its campaigns and capital-intensive projects translate it into the overall [[Return|return]] on earnings for the shareholders. As a stand-alone metric, the [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] tends to temper a company's issuance of new [[Stock|stock]] if it is attempting to raise more capital. [[Debt]] in the form of bonds tends to be a cheaper way of raising capital for most companies, and is easier for investors to calculate the capital costs of debt when doing balance sheet analysis.
