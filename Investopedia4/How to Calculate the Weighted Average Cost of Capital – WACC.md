How to Calculate the [[Weighted]] Average [[Cost of Capital]] – WACC
## What Is [[Weighted]] Average [[Cost of Capital]] – WACC?

The [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] (WACC) is a calculation of a firm's [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp) in which each category of capital is proportionately [[weighted]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weighted.asp). All sources of capital, including [[Common Stock|common stock]], [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], bonds, and any other long-term [[Debt|debt]], are included in a WACC calculation.

A firm’s WACC increases as the beta and rate of [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]] increase because an [[increase in WACC]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/what-does-high-[[Weighted|weighted]]-average-cost-capital-wacc-signify.asp) denotes a decrease in valuation and an increase in [[Risk|risk]].

## WACC Formula and Calculation

WACC\=EV∗Re+DV∗Rd∗(1−Tc)where:Re = Cost of equityRd = Cost of debtE = Market value of the firm’s equityD = Market value of the firm’s debtV = E + D = Total market value of the firm’s financingE/V = Percentage of financing that is equityD/V = Percentage of financing that is debtTc = Corporate tax rate\\begin{aligned} &\\text{WACC} = \\frac{E}{V} \* Re + \\frac{D}{V} \* Rd \* (1 - Tc)\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{Re = [[Cost of Equity|Cost of equity]]}\\\\ &\\text{Rd = [[Cost of Debt|Cost of debt]]}\\\\ &\\text{E = Market value of the firm's [[Equity|equity]]}\\\\ &\\text{D = Market value of the firm's [[Debt|debt]]}\\\\ &\\text{V = E + D = Total market value of the firm’s financing}\\\\ &\\text{E/V = Percentage of financing that is equity}\\\\ &\\text{D/V = Percentage of financing that is debt}\\\\ &\\text{Tc = [[Corporate Tax|Corporate tax]] rate}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

To calculate WACC the analyst [[Will|will]] multiply the cost of each capital component by its proportional weight. The sum of these results, in turn, is multiplied by 1 minus the [[Corporate Tax|corporate tax]] rate. Apply the following values to the formula [[Listed|listed]] above:

-   Re = [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]]
-   Rd = [[cost of debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofdebt.asp)
-   E = market value of the firm's [[Equity|equity]]
-   D = market value of the firm's [[Debt|debt]]
-   V = E + D = total market value of the firm’s financing ([[Equity|equity]] and [[Debt|debt]])
-   E/V = percentage of financing that is [[Equity|equity]]
-   D/V = percentage of financing that is [[Debt|debt]]
-   Tc = [[Corporate Tax|corporate tax]] rate

## Calculating WACC in Excel

The [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] (WACC) can be calculated in Excel. The biggest part is sourcing the correct data to plug into the model. See Investopedia’s notes on [[how to calculate WACC in Excel]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030915/what-formula-calculating-weighted-average-cost-capital-wacc-excel.asp).

## Explaining the Formula Elements

[Cost of equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofequity.asp) (Re) can be a bit tricky to calculate since share capital does not technically have an explicit value. When companies pay a [[Debt|debt]], the amount they pay has a predetermined associated interest rate that debt depends on the size and duration of the debt, though the value is relatively fixed. On the other hand, unlike debt, [[Equity|equity]] has no concrete price that the company must pay. Yet that doesn't mean there is no [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]].

Since shareholders [[Will|will]] expect to receive a certain [[Return|return]] on their investments in a company, the [[Equity|equity]] holders' required rate of return is a cost from the company's perspective, because if the company fails to deliver this expected return, shareholders will simply sell off their [[Shares|shares]], which leads to a decrease in share price and in the company’s value. The [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]], then, is essentially the amount that a company must spend in order to maintain a share price that will satisfy its investors.

Calculating the [[cost of debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofdebt.asp) (Rd), on the other hand, is a relatively straightforward process. To determine the [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]], you use the market rate that a company is currently paying on its [[Debt|debt]]. If the company is paying a rate other than the market rate, you can estimate an appropriate market rate and substitute it in your calculations instead.

There are tax deductions available on interest paid, which are often to companies’ benefit. Because of this, the net cost of a company's [[Debt|debt]] is the amount of interest it is paying, minus the amount it has saved in taxes as a result of its tax-deductible interest payments. This is why the after-tax [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]] is Rd (1 - [[Corporate Tax|corporate tax]] rate).

## Learning From WACC

WACC is the average of the costs of these types of financing, each of which is [[Weighted|weighted]] by its proportionate use in a given situation. By taking a weighted average in this way, we can determine how much interest a company owes for each dollar it finances.

[[Debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] are the two components that constitute a company’s capital funding. Lenders and equity holders [[Will|will]] expect to receive certain returns on the funds or capital they have provided. Since the [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] is the [[Return|return]] that equity owners (or shareholders) and debt holders will expect, WACC indicates the return that both kinds of stakeholders (equity owners and lenders) can expect to receive. Put another way, WACC is an investor’s opportunity cost of taking on the [[Risk|risk]] of investing money in a company.

A firm's WACC is the overall required [[Return|return]] for a firm. Because of this, company directors [[Will|will]] often use WACC internally in order to make decisions, like determining the economic feasibility of mergers and other expansionary opportunities. WACC is the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] that should be used for cash flows with the [[Risk|risk]] that is similar to that of the overall firm.

To help understand WACC, try to think of a company as a pool of money. Money enters the pool from two separate sources: [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]]. Proceeds earned through business operations are not considered a third source because, after a company pays off debt, the company retains any leftover money that is not returned to shareholders (in the form of dividends) on behalf of those shareholders.

## Who Uses WACC?

Securities analysts frequently use WACC when assessing the value of investments and when determining which ones to pursue. For example, in [[discounted cash flow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) analysis, one may apply WACC as the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] for future cash flows in order to derive a business's net present value. WACC may also be used as a [[Hurdle Rate|hurdle rate]] against which companies and investors can gauge [[return on invested capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp) (ROIC) performance. WACC is also essential in order to perform [[Economic Value|economic value]]-added (EVA) calculations.

Investors may often use WACC as an indicator of whether or not an investment is worth pursuing. Put simply, WACC is the minimum acceptable rate of [[Return|return]] at which a company yields returns for its investors. To determine an investor’s personal returns on an investment in a company, simply subtract the WACC from the company’s returns percentage.

## WACC vs. Required Rate of [[Return]] – RRR

The [[required rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredrateofreturn.asp) (RRR) is from the investor’s perspective, being the minimum rate an investor [[Will|will]] accept for a project or investment. Meanwhile, the [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] is what the company expects to [[Return|return]] on its securities.

## Limitations of WACC

The WACC formula seems easier to calculate than it really is. Because certain elements of the formula, like the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]], are not consistent values, various parties may report them differently for different reasons. As such, while WACC can often help lend valuable insight into a company, one should always use it along with other metrics when determining whether or not to invest in a company.

## Example of How to Use WACC

Suppose that a company yields returns of 20% and has a WACC of 11%. This means the company is yielding 9% returns on every dollar the company invests. In other words, for each dollar spent, the company is creating nine cents of value. On the other hand, if the company's [[Return|return]] is less than WACC, the company is losing value. If a company has returns of 11% and a WACC of 17%, the company is losing six cents for every dollar spent, indicating that potential investors would be best off putting their money elsewhere.

As a real-life example, consider Walmart (NYSE: WMT). The WACC of Walmart is 4.2%. That number is found by doing a number of calculations. First, we must find the financing structure of Walmart to calculate V, which is the total market value of the company’s financing. For Walmart, to find the market value of its [[Debt|debt]] we use the book value, which includes long-term debt and long-term [[Lease|lease]] and financial obligations.

As of the end of its most recent quarter (Oct. 31, 2018), its book value of [[Debt|debt]] was $50 billion. As of Feb. 5, 2019, its market cap (or [[Equity|equity]] value) is $276.7 billion. Thus, V is $326.7 billion, or $50 billion + $276.7 billion. Walmart finances operations with 85% equity (E / V, or $276.7 billion / $326.7 billion) and 15% debt (D / V, or $50 billion / $326.7 billion).

To find the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] (Re) one can use the [[capital asset pricing model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp) (CAPM). This model uses a company’s beta, the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate and expected [[Return|return]] of the market to determine the cost of [[Equity|equity]]. The formula is risk-free rate + beta \* (market return - risk-free rate). The 10-year Treasury rate can be used as the risk-free rate and the [[expected market return]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062215/how-expected-market-return-determined-when-calculating-market-risk-[[Premium|premium]].asp) is generally estimated to be 7%. Thus, Walmart’s cost of equity is 2.7% + 0.37 \* (7% - 2.7%), or 4.3%.

The [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]] is calculated by dividing the company’s interest expense by its [[Debt|debt]] load. In Walmart’s case, its recent fiscal year interest expense is $2.33 billion. Thus, its cost of debt is 4.7%, or $2.33 billion / $50 billion. The tax rate can be calculated by dividing the income tax expense by income before taxes. In Walmart’s case, it lays out the company’s tax rate in the [[annual report]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-annual-report/), said to be 30% for the last fiscal year.

Finally, we’re ready to calculate Walmart’s [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] (WACC). The WACC is 4.2%, with the calculation being 85% \* 4.3% + 15% \* 4.7% \* (1 - 30%).
