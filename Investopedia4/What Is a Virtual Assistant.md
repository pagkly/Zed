[[What Is a Virtual Assistant]]?
## [[What Is a Virtual Assistant]]?

A virtual assistant is an [[independent contractor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/independent-contractor.asp) who provides administrative services to clients while operating outside of the client's office. A virtual assistant typically operates from a [[Home Office|home office]] but can access the necessary planning documents, such as shared calendars, remotely.

People employed as virtual assistants often have several years of experience as an administrative assistant or office manager. New opportunities are opening up for virtual assistants who are skilled in [[Social Media|social media]], content management, blog post writing, graphic design, and Internet marketing. As [[working from home]](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/work-from-home-guide/) has become more accepted for both workers and employers, the demand for skilled virtual assistants is expected to grow.

### Key Takeaways

-   Typical tasks a virtual assistant might perform include scheduling appointments, making phone calls, making travel arrangements, and managing email accounts.
-   Some virtual assistants specialize in [[Offering|offering]] graphic design, blog writing, bookkeeping, [[Social Media|social media]], and marketing services.

## How a Virtual Assistant Works

Virtual assistants have become more prominent as small businesses and startups rely on [[virtual offices]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/virtual-office.asp) to keep costs down and businesses of all sizes increase their use of the Internet for daily operations. Because a virtual assistant is an independent contractor, a business does not have to provide the same benefits or pay the same taxes that it would for a full-time employee.

Also, since the virtual assistant works offsite, there is no need for a desk or other workspace at the company's office. A virtual assistant is expected to pay for and provide their own computer equipment, commonly used software programs, and high-speed Internet service.

In a study of over 100,000 job listings, FlexJobs found [[virtual administration]](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/fastest-growing-remote-career-categories/) was one of the top five fastest-growing remote career categories.

## Virtual Assistant Duties

The specific duties of a virtual assistant vary according to the needs of the client and the terms of the contract. Some virtual assistants handle clerical and bookkeeping tasks, while others may post regular updates to [[social media]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-media.asp) or write articles for a blog. A well-rounded virtual assistant may also handle travel arrangements, appointment scheduling, data entry, and online file storage.

## Virtual Assistant Qualifications

While there are no hard-and-fast educational requirements to become a virtual assistant, many clients [[Will|will]] look for virtual assistants who have some higher-level education or specialized training. A few online companies and community colleges [[Offer|offer]] courses and certification for virtual assistant skills.

A virtual assistant should be tech-savvy, having a wide range of computer skills and a high level of proficiency with commonly used software and business programs. A virtual assistant who specializes in bookkeeping should be adept at basic accounting tasks, such as account reconciliations and [[double-entry bookkeeping]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-entry.asp).

## Benefits of a Virtual Assistant

For the client, one advantage of hiring a virtual assistant is the flexibility to contract for just the services they need. Depending on the terms of the agreement, some virtual assistants may be paid by the task rather than by the hour. In contrast, employees in a traditional office setting usually must be paid for a fixed number of hours per day.

For small business owners, hiring a virtual assistant can help them free up valuable hours to focus on growing the business and generating revenue. It can be easier and more cost-effective to [[outsource tasks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsourcing.asp) that are tedious and time-consuming to someone who is skilled at them.

## How to Hire a Virtual Assistant

With the increasing number of freelance contractors who work from home, the employment market has seen a proliferation of Web-based companies that serve as intermediaries between prospective employers and contractors. Some [[freelancer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freelancer.asp) sites have enormous work pools made up of individuals across the globe with a wide range of experience and expertise.

On these sites, clients can post details about the type of tasks they need the virtual assistant to perform and the maximum rate they are willing to pay. Freelance workers may then bid on the job and give the client samples of their work for review. In some cases, the client can set up a [[video conference]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/video-conferencing.asp) to interview the applicants and to more thoroughly assess their qualifications.

## Special Considerations

Before hiring a virtual assistant, the client can ensure a smoother working relationship by creating detailed instructions about tasks they need to have performed. A written manual reduces the [[Risk|risk]] of misunderstandings that can occur in a remote working relationship.
