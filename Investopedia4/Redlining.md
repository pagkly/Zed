[[Redlining]]
## What Is [[Redlining]]?

[[Redlining]] is a discriminatory practice that puts services (financial and otherwise) out of reach for residents of certain areas based on race or ethnicity. It can be seen in the systematic denial of mortgages, insurance, loans, and other financial services based on location (and that area’s [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) history) rather than on an individual’s qualifications and [[creditworthiness]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp). Notably, the policy of redlining is felt the most by residents of minority neighborhoods.

### The History of [[Redlining]]

The term “[[Redlining|redlining]]” was coined by sociologist John McKnight in the 1960s and derives from how the federal government and lenders would literally draw a red line on a map around the neighborhoods they would not invest in based on demographics alone. Black inner-city neighborhoods were most likely to be redlined.1 Investigations found that lenders would make loans to lower-income Whites but not to middle- or upper-income African Americans.2

Indeed, in the 1930s the federal government began [[Redlining|redlining]] real [[Estate|estate]], marking “risky” neighborhoods for federal mortgage loans on the basis of race.3 The result of this redlining in real estate could still be felt decades later. In 1996 homes in redlined neighborhoods were worth less than half that of the homes in what the government had deemed as “best” for mortgage lending, and that disparity has only grown greater in the last two decades.4

Examples of [[Redlining|redlining]] can be found in a variety of financial services, including not only mortgages but also [[student loans]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/02/05/where-you-attend-college-could-be-costing-you-more-borrow-refinance-education-loans-report-says/), credit cards, and insurance. Although the [[Community Reinvestment Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/community_reinvestment_act.asp) was passed in 1977 to help prevent redlining, critics say discrimination continues to occur. For example, redlining has been used to describe discriminatory practices by [[retailers]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-17/retail-redlining-one-of-the-most-pervasive-forms-of-racism-left-in-america), both brick-and-mortar and online. Reverse redlining is the practice of targeting neighborhoods (mostly non-White) for higher prices or lending on unfair terms such as predatory lending of subprime mortgages.5

There's also evidence of what Midwest BankCentre CEO Orv Kimbrough calls "corporate [[Redlining|redlining]]." As reported by _The Business Journals_, since peaking prior to the 2008 [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]], the annual number of loans to Black-owned businesses through the U.S. Small Business Administration's 7(a) program decreased by 84%, compared to a 53% decline in 7(a) loans awarded overall.6 The report also found an overall trend of significantly less lending to businesses in Black-majority neighborhoods, compared to White-majority ones. 

Courts have determined that [[Redlining|redlining]] is illegal when lending institutions use race as a basis for excluding neighborhoods from access to loans. In addition, the [[Fair Housing Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fair-housing-act.asp), which is part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, prohibits discrimination in lending to individuals in neighborhoods based on their racial composition.7 However, the law does not prohibit excluding neighborhoods or regions on the basis of geological factors, such as fault lines or flood zones.

The destructive legacy of [[Redlining|redlining]] has been more than economic. A new 2020 study by researchers at the National Community [[Reinvestment]] Coalition, the University of Wisconsin/Milwaukee, and the University of Richmond finds that "the history of redlining, segregation and [[Disinvestment|disinvestment]] not only reduced minority wealth, it impacted health and longevity, resulting in a legacy of chronic disease and premature death in many high minority neighborhoods....On average, [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] is lower by 3.6 years in redlined communities, when compared to the communities that existed at the same time, but were high-graded by the HOLC."8

Lenders are not forbidden from [[Redlining|redlining]] areas with regard to geological factors, such as fault lines or flood zones.

## Special Considerations

While [[Redlining|redlining]] neighborhoods or regions based on race is illegal, lending institutions may take economic factors into account when making loans. [[Lending institutions are not required to approve all loan applications]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/peer-to-peer-loans.asp) on the same terms and may impose higher rates or stricter repayment terms on some borrowers. However, these considerations must be based on economic factors and cannot, under U.S. law, be based on race, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status.9

Banks may legally take the following factors into consideration when deciding whether to make loans to applicants and on which terms:

-   **Credit History.** Lenders may legally evaluate an applicant’s [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]] as determined by [[FICO]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fico-fair-isaac.asp) scores and reports from credit bureaus.
-   **Income.** Lenders may consider an applicant’s regular source of funds, which can include income from employment, business ownership, investments, or annuities.
-   **Property Condition.** A lending institution may evaluate the property on which it is making the [[Loan|loan]] as well as the condition of nearby properties. These evaluations must be based strictly on economic considerations.
-   **Neighborhood Amenities and City Services.** Lenders may take into account amenities that enhance or detract from the value of a property.
-   **The Lending Institution’s [[Portfolio]].** Lending institutions may take into account their requirements to have a portfolio that is diversified by region, structure type, and [[Loan|loan]] amount.9

Lenders must evaluate each of the above factors without regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status of the applicant.9

Mortgage applicants and homebuyers who believe that they might have been discriminated against can take their concerns to a fair housing center, the [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/aboutfheo) at U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or in the case of mortgages and other home loans, the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/mortgages/).
