[[Variance Swap]]
## What Is a [[Variance Swap]]?

A [[Variance Swap|variance swap]] is a financial [[derivative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) used to [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) or speculate on the magnitude of a price movement of an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset. These assets include exchange rates, interest rates, or the price of an index. In plain language, the variance is the difference between an expected result and the actual result.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Variance Swap|variance swap]] is when two parties [[Hedge|hedge]] on the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Volatility|volatility]] of an asset. It is similar to an interest rate [[Swap|swap]] in that two parties exchange payments based on the underlying asset's price changes.
-   Directional traders use variance trades to speculate on future levels of [[Volatility|volatility]] for an asset, spread traders use them to bet on the difference between realized volatility and implied volatility, and [[Hedge|hedge]] traders use swaps to cover short volatility positions.
-   If realized [[Volatility|volatility]] is more significant than the strike, then payoffs at maturity are positive.

## How a [[Variance Swap]] Works

Similar to a [[plain vanilla swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plain-vanilla-[[Swap|swap]].asp), one of the two parties involved in the transaction [[Will|will]] pay an amount based upon the actual variance of price changes of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset. The other party will pay a fixed amount, called the strike, specified at the start of the contract. The strike is typically set at the onset to make the [[net present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) (NPV) of the payoff zero.

At the end of the contract, the net payoff to the [[counterparties]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Counterparty|counterparty]].asp) [[Will|will]] be a theoretical amount multiplied by the difference between the [[variance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp) and a fixed amount of [[Volatility|volatility]], settled in cash. Due to any margin requirements specified in the contract, some payments may occur during the life of the contract should the contract's value move beyond agreed limits.

The [[Variance Swap|variance swap]], in mathematical terms, is the arithmetic average of the squared differences from the mean value. The square root of the variance is the [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp). Because of this, a variance [[Swap|swap]]'s [[Payout|payout]] [[Will|will]] be larger than that of a [[volatility swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatilityswap.asp), as the basis of these products is at variance rather than the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]].

## Understanding a [[Variance Swap]]

A [[Variance Swap|variance swap]] is a pure-play on an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset's [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp). Options also give an investor the possibility to speculate on an asset's volatility. But, options carry directional [[Risk|risk]], and their prices depend on many factors, including time, expiration, and implied volatility. Therefore, the equivalent [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) strategy requires additional risk hedging to complete. Variance swaps are also cheaper to put on since an options equivalent involves a strip of options.

There are three main classes of users for variance swaps.

1.  Directional traders use these swaps to speculate on the future level of [[Volatility|volatility]] for an asset.
2.  Spread traders merely bet on the difference between realized [[Volatility|volatility]] and [[implied volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp).
3.  Hedger traders use swaps to cover [[short]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) [[Volatility|volatility]] positions.

## Additional [[Variance Swap]] Characteristics

Variance swaps are well suited for [[speculation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Speculation|speculation]].asp) or hedging on [[Volatility|volatility]]. Unlike options, variance swaps do not require additional hedging. Options may require [[delta-hedging]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp). Also, the payoff at [[maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp) to the long holder of the [[Variance Swap|variance swap]] is always positive when realized volatility is more significant than the strike.

Buyers and sellers of [[Volatility|volatility]] swaps should know that any significant jumps in the price of the [[underlying asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-asset.asp) can skew the variance and produce unexpected results.
