Form 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income
## What Is Form 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income?

Form 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form taxpayers use to report non-employee compensation. This is generally a business payment—not a personal payment.

Independent contractors, freelancers, [[sole-proprietors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soleproprietorship.asp), and self-employed individuals, for example, receive one from each client who paid them $600 or more in a calendar year. The form is also used to report miscellaneous compensation such as rents, prizes, awards, healthcare payments, and payments to an attorney.1

A 1099-MISC form is one of many in the 1099 series and among the most commonly used. Taxpayers receive 1099s, including Form 1099-MISC, shortly after the end of the tax year.2 

### Key Takeaways

-   Form 1099-MISC is intended to report the income of taxpayers who are not employees, such as independent contractors, freelancers, sole-proprietors, and self-employed individuals.
-   The form is also used to report non-employee compensation such as rents, prizes, awards, healthcare payments, and payments to an attorney.
-   Recipients receive a Form 1099-MISC if they were paid $600 or more in a calendar year.

## Who Can File Form 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income?

Form 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income is completed and sent out by someone who has paid at least $10 in royalties or broker payments instead of dividends or [[Tax-Exempt Interest|tax-exempt interest]] to another individual. The form is also sent to anyone who received at least $600 in:

-   Rents
-   Services performed by someone other than an employee
-   Prizes and awards
-   Other income payments
-   Medical and healthcare payments
-   Crop insurance proceeds
-   Cash payments for fish (or other aquatic life) purchased from anyone who makes a living catching fish
-   Cash paid from a [[notional principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notionalprincipalamount.asp) contract to an individual, partnership, or [[Estate|estate]]
-   Payments to an attorney
-   Any fishing boat proceeds1

This form can also be used to report earnings from direct sales of at least $5,000 of consumer products to a buyer for resale anywhere other than a permanent retail establishment.1

The payer must send the form to the recipient and IRS by Feb. 1. The recipient can attach the form to their [[Tax Return|tax return]].

If you earned less than $600 and do not have a 1099-MISC, you must still report your income to the IRS.

## Special Considerations for Form 1099-MISC

The IRS overhauled Form 1099-MISC in 2020 and introduced a new form, called [1099-NEC: Non-Employee Compensation](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099nec.pdf), starting in the 2020 tax year.3 Form 1099-NEC [[Will|will]] be used to report payments to non-employees currently reported in Box 7 of Form 1099-MISC. If you still need to report for tax year 2019, make sure to use the older [2019 version](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f1099msc--2019.pdf) of Form 1099-MISC.
