[[Guilder Share (New York Share)]]
## What Is a Guilder Share?

An ownership stake in a Dutch company that can be traded in the United States because it represents [[Shares|shares]] that have been canceled in Dutch markets. Guilder Shares, also called New York Shares, represent a special international trading arrangement for shares of Dutch companies only, since the [[Stocks|stocks]] of Dutch companies can't be traded through [[American depository receipts (ADR)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp).

## Understanding [[Guilder Share (New York Share)]]

When buying [[Shares|shares]] of a company located in a foreign country, U.S. citizens [[Will|will]] generally buy an ADR, a certificate that represents those foreign shares. Since the Netherlands do not allow Dutch company [[Stock|stock]] to be traded in other countries, a certain number of [[shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp) must be canceled in the Netherlands then grouped and sold as Guilder Shares that can then be issued in the U.S.  
The guilder was also once the name of a Dutch currency.
