[[Freddie Mac—Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC)]]
## What Is Freddie Mac (Federal Home [[Loan]] Mortgage Corp. or FHLMC)?

The Federal Home [[Loan]] Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC) is a stockholder-owned, [[government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp) chartered by Congress in 1970 to keep money flowing to mortgage lenders in support of homeownership and rental housing for middle-income Americans. The FHLMC, familiarly known as Freddie Mac, purchases, guarantees, and [[securitizes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitize.asp) mortgages to form [[mortgage-backed securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp).1

### Key Takeaways

-   Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned, government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) chartered by Congress in 1970 in support of homeownership for middle-income Americans. 
-   The role of Freddie Mac is to buy a large number of loans from mortgage lenders, then combine them and sell them as mortgage-backed securities.
-   Freddie Mac is the officially recognized nickname for the Federal Home [[Loan]] Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC).
-   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are both publicly traded GSEs. The main difference between them is that Fannie Mae buys mortgage loans from major retail or commercial banks, while Freddie Mac obtains its loans from smaller banks. 
-   Some have argued that unchecked growth for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was a primary driver in what led to the credit crisis of 2008 that turned into the Great Recession.

## Understanding Freddie Mac

Freddie Mac was created when Congress passed the Emergency Home [[Finance]] Act in 1970. This was done in an attempt to expand the secondary mortgage market while reducing interest rate [[Risk|risk]] for banks. In 1989 Freddie Mac underwent a reorganization and was turned into a shareholder-owned company, now under the [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-institutions-reform-recovery-enforcement.asp).2

Freddie Mac was created to enhance the flow of credit to different parts of the economy. [[Freddie Mac and a similar GSE, Fannie Mae]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/fannie-freddie.asp), securitized and guaranteed about 46% of U.S. mortgage originations in 2017.3 These GSEs do not originate or service mortgages; instead, they buy loans from mortgage lenders.

After purchasing a large number of these mortgages, they combine and sell them as mortgage-backed securities, which tend to be very liquid and carry a credit [[Rating|rating]] close to that of U.S. Treasuries.4 This process frees up the capital of mortgage lenders, which means they can lend that same money again.1

Freddie Mac doesn’t originate or service home mortgages; rather, it buys loans from mortgage lenders, freeing up their capital for more lending.

Freddie Mac has come under criticism because its ties to the U.S. government allow it to borrow money at interest rates lower than those available to other financial institutions. With this funding advantage, it issues large amounts of [[Debt|debt]] (known in the marketplace as “agency debt” or “agencies”), and in turn purchases and holds a huge [[portfolio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp) of mortgages known as its “retained portfolio.”

Some people believe that the size of the retained [[Portfolio|portfolio]] combined with the complexities of managing mortgage [[Risk|risk]] poses a great deal of [[systematic risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp) to the U.S. economy. Critics have argued that the [[unchecked growth of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/08/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-credit-crisis.asp) led to the credit crisis of 2008 that turned into the [[Great Recession]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp), though others disagree.5

The Federal Housing [[Finance]] Agency has announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s foreclosure and evictions moratoriums, put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have been extended to Feb. 28, 2021. They apply to single-family mortgages and [[Real Estate Owned (REO)|real estate owned (REO)]] evictions only.6

## Freddie Mac vs. Fannie Mae 

Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association or FNMA) was created in 1938 as part of an amendment to the [[National Housing Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/national-housing-act.asp). It was considered a federal government agency, and its role was to act as a secondary mortgage market that could purchase, [[Hold|hold]], or sell loans that were insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Fannie Mae stopped being a federal government agency and became a private-public corporation under the Charter Act of 1954.2

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are very similar. Both are publicly traded companies that were chartered to serve a public mission. The main difference between the two comes down to the source of the mortgages they buy. Fannie Mae buys mortgage loans from major retail or commercial banks, while Freddie Mac obtains its loans from smaller banks, often called “[thrift banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thriftbank.asp)” or “savings and [[Loan|loan]] associations,” [[that are focused on providing banking services to communities]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-difference-between-savings-loan-company-and-bank.asp).2
