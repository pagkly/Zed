[[What Is a Stock Screener]]?
## [[What Is a Stock Screener|What is A Stock Screener]]?

A [[Stock|stock]] screener is a set of tools that allow investors to quickly sort through the myriad of available [[Stocks|stocks]] (and increasingly ETFs—see [[ETFDB.com]](https://etfdb.com/)) according to the investor’s own criteria. Stock screeners are most typically available on brokerage trading platforms (usually free), but there are also some independent subscription-based stock screeners available. Stock screeners allow investors to employ their own methodology about what makes a stock/ETF valuable (longer-term traders) or spot a potential trading opportunity (shorter-term traders). 

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Stock]] screeners are tools that allow investors and traders to sort through thousands of individual securities to find those that fit their own methodologies.
-   These tools are typically free to use on most brokerage sites and are available on some subscription sites, too.
-   Screening tools are useful to both fundamental and technical traders, professional and individual investors.
-   [[Stock]] screeners can deliver alerts if certain user-defined parameters have been met, drawing investor attention to key buying or selling opportunities.
-   Screeners are dependent on user inputs to narrow down the field of investment opportunities.

## How [[Stock]] Screeners Work

[[Stock]] screeners allow investors to weed through the extensive field of potential financial investments using their own criteria. Users begin the process by selecting certain investing parameters, based on their personal requirements. For example, a fundamental investor may be most interested in [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]], analyst recommendations, [[EPS]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp), operating [[Cash Flow|cash flow]], multi-year [[ROI]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp), dividend [[Yield|yield]], and the like. A technical trader would be more interested in moving average levels/crossovers, [[RSI]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) levels to indicate [[Momentum|momentum]], [[ADX]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) readings to indicate strength, and chart patterns, among others.

The more criteria the user adds, the smaller the pool of potential securities to invest in becomes. The bottom line is that [[Stock|stock]] screeners typically have something for every investor and should be used to see what type of information is available before entering a trade or investment.

## An Example of a [[Stock]] Screener

When you first encounter a [[Stock|stock]] screener, you’re likely to be overwhelmed. There [[Will|will]] be dozens of categories to view, both on the technical side and the fundamental side. So before you dive in, decide which side of the valley you’re on—technical or fundamental. Consider what you're looking for, what your priorities are, and what types of financial instruments might be of interest. Then you can begin to explore what the screener has to [[Offer|offer]].

If your focus is on the short-term, you are likely to be drawn to the multiple technical tools available: charting; alerts; [[Momentum|momentum]] studies, RSI, and more technical studies. If you’re focused on a particular [[Stock|stock]] or ETF, you can set alerts for when that particular stock crosses a set [[Price Level|price level]], or for when its RSI hits [[Overbought|overbought]]/sold, for example.

If you’re a longer-term investor, you’ll find plenty of fundamental data (sometimes referred to as technical data), such as EPS, average daily volume, [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]], and the like. Such data can help you construct a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] keeping in mind that you have a longer-term interest in the company, beyond just the latest headlines.
