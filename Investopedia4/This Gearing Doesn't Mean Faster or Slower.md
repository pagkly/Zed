[[This Gearing Doesn't Mean Faster or Slower]]
## What Is Gearing?

Gearing refers to the relationship, or ratio, of a company's [[debt-to-equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121614/what-difference-between-gearing-ratio-and-debttoequity-ratio.asp) (D/E). Gearing shows the extent to which a firm's operations are funded by lenders versus shareholders—in other words, it measures a company’s financial [[Leverage|leverage]]. When the proportion of [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] is great, then a business may be thought of as being highly geared, or highly leveraged.

### Key Takeaways

-   Gearing can be thought of as [[Leverage|leverage]], where it's measured by various leverage ratios, such as the [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] (D/E) ratio.
-   If a company has high [[Leverage|leverage]] ratios, it can be thought of as being highly geared.
-   The appropriate level of gearing for a company depends on its sector and the degree of [[Leverage|leverage]] of its corporate peers.

## Understanding Gearing

Gearing is measured by a number of ratios—including the D/E ratio, shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] ratio, and [[debt-service coverage ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dscr.asp) (DSCR)—which indicate the level of [[Risk|risk]] associated with a particular business. The appropriate level of gearing for a company depends on its sector and the degree of [[Leverage|leverage]] of its corporate peers.

For example, a [[gearing ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gearingratio.asp) of 70% shows that a company’s [[Debt|debt]] levels are 70% of its [[Equity|equity]]. A gearing ratio of 70% might be very manageable for a utility company—as the business functions as a [[Monopoly|monopoly]] with support from local government channels—but it may be excessive for a technology company, with intense competition in a rapidly changing marketplace.

## Special Considerations

Gearing, or [[Leverage|leverage]], helps to determine a company's [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]]. Lenders may consider a business’s gearing ratio when deciding whether to extend it credit; to which a [[Lender|lender]] might add factors like whether the [[Loan|loan]] would be supported with [[Collateral|collateral]], and if the lender would qualify as a "senior" lender. With this information, senior lenders might choose to remove short-term [[Debt|debt]] obligations when calculating the gearing ratio, as senior lenders receive priority in the event of a business’s bankruptcy.

In cases where a [[Lender|lender]] would be [[Offering|offering]] an [[Unsecured Loan|unsecured loan]], the gearing ratio could include information about the presence of senior lenders and preferred stockholders, who have certain payment guarantees. This allows the lender to adjust the calculation to reflect the higher level of [[risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]].asp) than would be present with a secured [[Loan|loan]].

## Gearing vs. [[Risk]]

In general, a company with excessive [[Leverage|leverage]], demonstrated by its high gearing ratio, could be more vulnerable to [[economic downturns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp) than a company that's not as leveraged, because a highly leveraged firm must make interest payments and service its [[Debt|debt]] via cash flows, which could decline during a downturn. On the other hand, the [[Risk|risk]] of being highly leveraged works well during good economic times, as all of the excess cash flows accrue to shareholders once the debt has been paid down.

## Example of Gearing

As a simple illustration, in order to fund its expansion, XYZ Corporation cannot sell additional [[Shares|shares]] to investors at a reasonable price; so instead, it obtains a $10,000,000 short-term [[Loan|loan]]. Currently, XYZ Corporation has $2,000,000 of [[Equity|equity]]; so the [[debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp) is 5x—\[$10,000,000 (total liabilities) _divided by_ $2,000,000 (shareholders' equity) _equals_ 5x\]. XYZ Corporation definitely would be considered highly geared.
