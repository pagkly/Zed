[[Spot Market]]
## What is a [[Spot Market]]?

The [[Spot Market|spot market]] is where financial instruments, such as [[commodities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), currencies and securities, are traded for immediate delivery. Delivery is the exchange of cash for the financial instrument. A [[futures contract]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp), on the other hand, is based on the delivery of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset at a future date.

Exchanges and [[over-the-counter (OTC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) markets may provide spot trading and/or [[Futures|futures]] trading. 

## [[Spot Market]] Explained

Spot markets are also referred to as “physical markets” or “[cash markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashmarket.asp)” because trades are swapped for the asset effectively immediately. While the official transfer of funds between the buyer and seller may take time, such as [[T+2]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tplus1.asp) in the [[Stock|stock]] market and in most currency transactions, both parties agree to the trade “right now.” A non-spot, or [[Futures|futures]] transaction, is agreeing to a price now, but delivery and transfer of funds [[Will|will]] take place at a later date.

[[Futures]] trades in contracts that are about to expire are also sometimes called spot trades since the expiring contract means that the buyer and seller [[Will|will]] be exchanging cash for the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset immediately.

## Spot Price

The current price of a financial instrument is called the spot price. It is the price at which an instrument can be sold or bought at immediately. Buyers and sellers create the spot price by posting their buy and sell orders. In [[liquid]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) markets, the spot price may change by the second, as orders get [[filled]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fill.asp) and new ones enter the marketplace.

## [[Spot Market]] and Exchanges

Exchanges bring together [[dealers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dealer.asp) and traders who buy and sell commodities, securities, [[Futures|futures]], options and other financial instruments. Based on all the orders provided by participants, the exchange provides the current price and [[volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) available to traders with access to the exchange.

The [[New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE) is an example of an exchange where traders buy and sell [[Stocks|stocks]]. This is a [[Spot Market|spot market]].

The [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp) (CME) is an example of an exchange where traders buy and sell [[Futures|futures]] contracts. This is a futures market.

## [[Spot Market]] and Over-the-Counter

Trades that occur directly between a buyer and seller are called [[Over-The-Counter (OTC)|over-the-counter (OTC)]]. A centralized exchange does not facilitate these trades. The [[foreign exchange market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/foreign-exchange-markets.asp) (or [[forex]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/why-trade-forex.asp) market) is the world's largest OTC market with an average daily turnover of $5 trillion.

In an OTC transaction, the price can be either based on a spot or a future price/date. In an OTC transaction the terms are not necessarily standardized, and therefore, may be subject to the discretion of the buyer and/or seller. As with exchanges, OTC [[Stock|stock]] transactions are typically spot trades, while [[Futures|futures]] or [[forward]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp) transactions are often not spot.

## Real World Example of Dealing in the [[Spot Market]]

Let’s say an online furniture store in Germany offers a 30% discount to all international customers who pay within five business days after placing an order.

Danielle, who operates an online furniture business in the United States, sees the [[Offer|offer]] and decides to purchase $10,000 worth of tables from the online store. Since she needs to buy euros for (almost) immediate delivery and is happy with the current [[EUR]]/USD [[exchange rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp) of 1.1233, Danielle executes a foreign exchange transaction at the spot price to buy the equivalent of $10,000 in [[euros]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp), which works out to be €8,902.34 ($10,000/1.1233). The spot transaction has a settlement date of T+2, so Danielle receives her euros in two days and settles her account to receive the 30% discount.
