[[Offer In Compromise]]
## What is an [[Offer In Compromise]]

[[Offer In Compromise|Offer in compromise]] is a program instituted by the [[Internal Revenue Service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) for taxpayers who cannot pay the taxes they owe, or for taxpayers for whom it would create a financial hardship to pay the taxes they owe. An [[Offer|offer]] in compromise allows taxpayers to settle their tax bill for less than the full amount owed.1 

When considering whether to allow a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] to settle his bill with an [[Offer In Compromise|offer in compromise]], the IRS [[Will|will]] look at the taxpayer's unique circumstances, including their income, ability to pay, expenses, and any assets the taxpayers owes.1

## Breaking Down [[Offer In Compromise]]

Offers in compromise are only available to eligible taxpayers. Taxpayers can find out if they are eligible for this program by consulting the [[Offer In Compromise|Offer in Compromise]] Pre-Qualifier questionnaire online. The questionnaire [[Will|will]] ask whether you are in an open bankruptcy proceeding, have filled out all the tax returns required of you and whether you have filled out the required tax documents of someone who is self-employed or has employed others. You will then have to input your zip code, state, county, the total number of people in your household and your total tax [[Debt|debt]].2

The next step of the questionnaire concerns your [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp). The Internal Revenue Service [[Will|will]] require you to input your total bank balances, the value of any [[Home Equity|home equity]] you own, the value of any [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds or other financial assets you own, and other assets. Then it will ask you for your income from any jobs you have, or from interest or dividend income. After giving this information, you will be required to list your expenses, including rent, mortgage, and vehicle related expenses. If you don’t have vehicle-related expenses, you will be allowed to list expenses for public transportation. After filing this information, the IRS website will determine whether you qualify for an [[Offer In Compromise|offer in compromise]].2 If you or your business are involved in an open bankruptcy proceeding, you are not eligible to apply for an [[Offer|offer]].3
