[[Wholesale Money]]
## What Is [[Wholesale Money]]?

[[Wholesale Money|Wholesale money]] refers to the large sums of money lent by financial institutions in the [[money markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarket.asp). This [[wholesale banking]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wholesalebanking.asp) encompasses the market for tradable securities, such as Treasury bills, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, foreign or brokered deposits, certificates of deposit, bills of exchange, repo agreements, federal funds, and short-lived mortgage and asset-backed securities.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Wholesale Money|Wholesale money]] refers to large sums of money lent by financial institutions in money markets.
-   As the subprime crisis showed, it is quick to arrange but dangerous to rely on.
-   [[Wholesale Money|Wholesale money]] markets are a good [[Leading Indicator|leading indicator]] of stress in the financial system.

## Understanding [[Wholesale Money]]

[[Wholesale Money|Wholesale money]] is a way for large corporations and financial institutions to obtain working capital and other types of short-term financing—and it is critical to the proper functioning of the U.S. and global financial systems.

Wholesale funding can be quick to arrange but [[dangerous to rely on]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/09/when-wholesale-funding-goes-bad.asp), as banks discovered during the global [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] when the wholesale funding market collapsed. Excessive use of short-term wholesale funding—instead of retail deposits—and [[repurchase agreements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repurchaseagreement.asp) left banks exposed to [[liquidity risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityrisk.asp) when [[Liquidity|liquidity]] mattered most.

An example of this occurred after the collapse of Lehman Brothers during the 2008 [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]]. A bank run ensued and investors took out their wholesale funds. Wachovia is reported to have lost approximately 1% (or approximately $5 billion) of its funds. The bank was directed by FDIC to negotiate with Citigroup and Wells Fargo for a takeover instead of filing for bankruptcy. Over a weekend, it was sold to Wells Fargo for approximately $15 billion.

A defining moment of the subprime crisis happened in 2007, when [[Northern Rock]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/09/financial-crisis-review.asp), a British bank that had relied on wholesale markets for most of its [[Finance|finance]], was no longer able to fund its lending activities and had to ask the Bank of England for emergency funding.

## Indications of [[Wholesale Money]] Markets

[[Wholesale Money|Wholesale money]] markets are therefore a good [[Leading Indicator|leading indicator]] of stress in the financial system—and paint a truer picture of the cost of borrowing than central banks’ official interest rates. Today, the [[OIS discounted]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/021815/introduction-ois-discounting.asp) overnight rate has become a key measure of credit [[Risk|risk]] within the banking sector, using short-term benchmark rates such as the [[Federal Funds Rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp).

The demand for high quality liquid assets (HQLA) in the global financial markets suggests that [[Wholesale Money|wholesale money]] markets are a long way from being repaired, even as global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) comply with new [[Basel III]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basell-iii.asp) capital and [[Liquidity|liquidity]] measures—such as the [[liquidity coverage ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity-coverage-ratio.asp) and the net stable funding ratio.

In the U.S., new [[Money Market|money market]] regulations came into force in 2016, but the Federal Reserve [[Will|will]] have to provide stability to the lending markets through its [[Reverse Repurchase]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverserepurchaseagreement.asp) (RRP) facility for some time. This is because rising interest rates increase banks’ reliance upon wholesale funding by reducing retail deposits. This, in turn, increases [[systemic risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systemic-[[Risk|risk]].asp).
