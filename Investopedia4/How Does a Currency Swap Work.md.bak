[[How Does a Currency Swap Work]]?
## What Is a Currency [[Swap]]?

A currency [[Swap|swap]], sometimes referred to as a cross-currency [[swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp), involves the exchange of interest—and sometimes of [[Principal|principal]]—in one currency for the same in another currency. Interest payments are exchanged at fixed dates through the life of the contract. It is considered to be a [[foreign exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp) transaction and is not required by law to be shown on a [[company's balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/031004.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A currency [[Swap|swap]] involves the exchange of interest—and sometimes of [[Principal|principal]]—in one currency for the same in another currency.
-   Companies doing business abroad often use currency swaps to get more favorable [[Loan|loan]] rates in the local currency than if they borrowed money from a local bank.
-   Considered to be a foreign exchange transaction, currency swaps are not required by law to be shown on a company's balance sheet.
-   Interest rate variations for currency swaps include fixed rate to fixed rate, floating rate to floating rate, or fixed rate to floating rate.

## The Basics of Currency Swaps

Currency swaps were originally done to get around [[exchange controls]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangecontrol.asp), governmental limitations on the purchase and/or sale of currencies. Although nations with weak and/or developing economies generally use foreign exchange controls to limit [[Speculation|speculation]] against their currencies, most [[developed economies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp) have eliminated controls nowadays.

So swaps are now done most commonly to [[Hedge|hedge]] [[long-term investments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longterminvestments.asp) and to change the interest rate exposure of the two parties. Companies doing business abroad often use currency swaps to get more favorable [[Loan|loan]] rates in the local currency than they could if they borrowed money from a bank in that country.

Currency swaps are important financial instruments used by banks, investors, and multinational corporations.

## How a Currency [[Swap]] Works

In a currency [[Swap|swap]], the parties agree in advance whether or not they [[Will|will]] [[exchange the principal amounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042315/how-do-currency-swaps-work.asp) of the two currencies at the beginning of the transaction. The two [[Principal|principal]] amounts create an implied [[exchange rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp). For example, if a swap involves exchanging €10 million versus $12.5 million, that creates an implied [[EUR]]/USD exchange rate of 1.25. At maturity, the same two principal amounts must be exchanged, which creates exchange rate [[Risk|risk]] as the market may have moved far from 1.25 in the intervening years.

Pricing is usually expressed as [[London Interbank Offered Rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) (LIBOR), plus or minus a certain number of points, based on interest rate curves at inception and the [[credit risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) of the two parties.

Due to recent scandals and questions around its validity as a benchmark rate, LIBOR is being phased out. According to the Federal Reserve and regulators in the UK, LIBOR [[Will|will]] be phased out by June 30, 2023, and will be replaced by the [[Secured Overnight Financing Rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-overnight-financing-rate-sofr-4683954) (SOFR). As part of this phase-out, LIBOR one-week and two-month USD LIBOR rates will no longer be published after December 31, 2021.1 

A currency [[Swap|swap]] can be done in several ways. Many swaps use simply [[notional principal amounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notionalprincipalamount.asp), which means that the [[Principal|principal]] amounts are used to calculate the [[interest due]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest-due.asp) and payable each period but is not exchanged.

If there is a full exchange of [[Principal|principal]] when the deal is initiated, the exchange is reversed at the [[maturity date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp). Currency [[Swap|swap]] [[maturities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp) are [[negotiable]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negotiable.asp) for at least 10 years, making them a very flexible method of foreign exchange. Interest rates can be fixed or floating.

## Exchange of Interest Rates in Currency Swaps

There are three variations on the exchange of interest rates: fixed rate to fixed rate; floating rate to floating rate; or fixed rate to floating rate. This means that in a [[Swap|swap]] between euros and dollars, a party that has an initial obligation to pay a [[fixed interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp) on a euro [[Loan|loan]] can exchange that for a fixed interest rate in dollars or for a floating rate in dollars. Alternatively, a party whose euro loan is at a [[floating interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatinginterestrate.asp) can exchange that for either a floating or a fixed rate in dollars. A swap of two floating rates is sometimes called a [[basis swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basisrateswap.asp).

Interest rate payments are usually calculated quarterly and exchanged semi-annually, although swaps can be structured as needed. Interest payments are generally not netted because they are in different currencies.
