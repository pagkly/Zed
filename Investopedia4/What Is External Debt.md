[[What Is External Debt]]?
## [[What Is External Debt]]?

External [[Debt|debt]] is the portion of a country's debt that is borrowed from foreign [[lenders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp), including commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions. These loans, including [[interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp), must usually be paid in the currency in which the [[Loan|loan]] was made. To earn the needed [[currency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp), the borrowing country may sell and export goods to the lending country.

### Key Takeaways:

-   External [[Debt|debt]] is the portion of a country's debt that is borrowed from foreign lenders through commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions.
-   If a country cannot repay its external [[Debt|debt]], it faces a debt crisis.
-   If a nation fails to repay its external [[Debt|debt]], it is said to be in sovereign [[Default|default]].
-   External [[Debt|debt]] can take the form of a tied [[Loan|loan]], whereby the borrower must apply any spending of the funds to the country that is providing the loan.

## Understanding External [[Debt]]

A [[debt crisis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-sovereign-[[Debt|debt]]-crisis.asp) can occur if a country with a weak economy is not able to repay the external debt due to an inability to produce and sell goods and make a profitable [[Return|return]]. The [[International Monetary Fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imf.asp) (IMF) is one of the agencies that keeps track of countries' external debt. [[The World Bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldbank.asp) publishes a quarterly report on external debt statistics.

If a nation is unable or refuses to repay its external [[Debt|debt]], it is said to be in [[sovereign default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-[[Default|default]].asp). This can lead to the lenders withholding future releases of assets that might be needed by the borrowing nation. Such instances can have a rolling effect. The borrower’s currency may collapse, and the nation’s overall economic growth [[Will|will]] stall.

The conditions of [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) can make it challenging for a country to repay what it owes plus any penalties the [[Lender|lender]] has brought against the delinquent nation. Defaults and [[bankruptcies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) in the case of countries are handled differently than defaults and bankruptices in the consumer market. It is possible that countries that [[Default|default]] on external [[Debt|debt]] may potentially avoid having to repay it.

### How External [[Debt]] Is Used by the Borrower

Sometimes referred to as foreign [[Debt|debt]], corporations, as well as governments, can procure external debt. In many instances, external debt takes the form of a tied [[Loan|loan]], which means the funds secured through the financing must be spent in the nation that is providing the financing. For instance, the loan might allow one nation to buy resources it needs from the country that provided the loan.

External [[Debt|debt]], particularly tied loans, might be set for specific purposes that are defined by the borrower and [[Lender|lender]]. Such financial aid could be used to address humanitarian or disaster needs. For example, if a nation faces severe famine and cannot secure emergency food through its own resources, it might use external debt to procure food from the nation providing the tied [[Loan|loan]]. If a country needs to build up its energy infrastructure, it might [[Leverage|leverage]] external debt as part of an agreement to buy resources, such as the materials to construct power plants in underserved areas.
