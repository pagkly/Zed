[[Unsubordinated Debt Definition]]
## What Is Unsubordinated [[Debt]]?

Unsubordinated [[Debt|debt]], also known as a senior [[Security|security]] or [[senior debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seniordebt.asp), refers to a type of obligation that must be repaid before any other form of debt. So, holders of unsubordinated debt have the first claim over a company's [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) or earnings if the [[Debtor|debtor]] goes bankrupt or insolvent. Because unsubordinated debt comes with a guarantee of repayment, they are considered less risky than other types of debt.

### Key Takeaways

-   Unsubordinated [[Debt|debt]] is an obligation that must be repaid before any other form of debt if the [[Debtor|debtor]] goes bankrupt or insolvent.
-   The majority of unsubordinated [[Debt|debt]] is usually secured by [[Collateral|collateral]].
-   This kind of [[Debt|debt]] is also known as a senior [[Security|security]] or senior debt.
-   Types of unsubordinated [[Debt|debt]] include exchange-traded notes, collateralized securities, and certificates of deposit.

## How Unsubordinated [[Debt]] Works

When a company goes bankrupt or insolvent, there is normally a chain or ranking of creditors who get paid in a specific order. Lenders of unsubordinated [[Debt|debt]] get paid out in full first by the company. The majority of this type of debt is usually secured by [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp).

Most loans from financial institutions and certain high-grade [[Debt|debt]] securities such as [[mortgage bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage_bond.asp) are deemed senior debt. Loans are also considered unsubordinated based on the balance and the length of time outstanding in comparison with other loans.

Because senior [[Debt|debt]] has a relatively secure claim, it is considered to be less risky. As such, it pays a lower rate of interest compared to other types of debt. This means lenders are willing to compensate for lower borrowing rates by claiming a higher priority over a borrower’s assets since they [[Will|will]] be repaid first during a liquidation event.

Because they come with some [[Security|security]], unsubordinated [[Debt|debt]] lenders normally charge lower interest rates to their debtors.

After unsubordinated [[Debt|debt]] lenders are paid, any remaining money goes to [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) holders, subordinated debt, followed by common shareholders.

## Types of Unsubordinated [[Debt]]

Examples of unsubordinated [[Debt|debt]] include [[exchange-traded notes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etn.asp) (ETNs), collateralized securities, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Collateralized securities such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are structured with a number of [[tranches]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/[[Tranches|tranches]].asp) that bear different risks, interest rates, and maturities. Tranches with a higher claim on [[Underlying|underlying]] assets are safer than junior tranches with a second [[Lien|lien]]. Senior tranches also have a higher credit [[Rating|rating]] than junior tranches and are paid first.

## Unsubordinated vs. Subordinated [[Debt]]

Unsubordinated [[Debt|debt]] is the opposite of [[subordinated debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subordinateddebt.asp). This type of debt vehicle is ranked below all senior debts of a company. Subordinated debt is also called junior debt, and is subject to subordination in the event of [[Default|default]] or [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp).

When a company’s assets are [[liquidated]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp) to pay off its [[Debt|debt]] obligations, subordinated debt holders receive payment after all unsubordinated debt lenders and [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] holders are paid. In some cases, there is no cash left after paying the unsubordinated lenders, which means every other [[Creditor|creditor]] remains unpaid.

Because there is more [[Risk|risk]] associated with subordinated [[Debt|debt]], these lenders normally charge higher interest rates compared to unsubordinated debt.
