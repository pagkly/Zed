[[Make-Whole Call Provision]]
## What Is a Make-Whole Call?

A [[Make-Whole Call Provision|make-whole call provision]] is a type of [[call provision]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callprovision.asp) on a bond allowing the issuer to pay off remaining [[Debt|debt]] early. The issuer typically has to make a lump-sum payment to the investor. The payment is derived from a formula based on the net present value ([NPV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp)) of previously scheduled [[coupon]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) payments and the [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) that the investor would have received.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Make-Whole Call Provision|make-whole call provision]] is a type of call provision on a bond allowing the issuer to pay off remaining [[Debt|debt]] early.
-   The payment is derived from a formula based on the [[Net Present Value (NPV)|net present value (NPV)]] of previously scheduled coupon payments and the [[Principal|principal]] that the investor would have received.
-   Issuers typically don't expect to have to use this type of call provision, and make-whole calls are rarely exercised.
-   Make-whole calls are better for investors than standard call provisions.

## Understanding Make-Whole Calls

Make-whole call provisions are defined in the [[indenture]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indenture.asp) of a bond. These provisions began to be included in bond indentures in the 1990s. Issuers typically don't expect to have to use this type of call provision, and make-whole calls are rarely exercised. However, the issuer may decide to utilize its [[Make-Whole Call Provision|make-whole call provision]] on a bond. Then, investors [[Will|will]] be compensated, or made whole, for the remaining payments and [[Principal|principal]] from the bond as noted within the bond's indenture.

In a make-whole call, the investor receives a single payment for the NPV of all future cash flows of the bond. That typically includes the remaining coupon payments associated with the bond under the [[Make-Whole Call Provision|make-whole call provision]]. It also includes the [[par value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) [[Principal|principal]] payment of the bond. A lump-sum payment paid to an investor in a make-whole call provision is equal to the NPV of all these future payments. The payments were agreed upon in the make-whole call provision within the indenture. The NPV is calculated based on the market [[Discount Rate|discount rate]].

Make-whole calls are typically exercised when [[interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) have decreased. Therefore, the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] for the NPV calculation is likely to be lower than the initial rate when the bond was offered. That works to the benefit of the investor. A lower NPV discount rate can make the make-whole call payments slightly more expensive for the issuer. The cost of a make-whole call can often be high, so such provisions are rarely invoked.

Bonds are less likely to be called in a stable interest rate environment. Call provisions were more of an issue when interest rates generally declined between 1980 and 2008.

Make-whole call provisions can be expensive to exercise because they require a full lump sum payment. Consequently, companies that utilize make-whole call provisions usually do so because interest rates have fallen. When rates have decreased or are trending lower, a company has an added incentive to exercise make-whole call provisions. If interest rates have dropped, then issuers of corporate bonds can [[issue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issue.asp) new bonds at a lower rate of interest. These new bonds require lower coupon payments to their investors.

## Advantages of Make-Whole Calls

Make-whole calls are better for investors than standard call provisions. With a standard call, the investor would only receive the [[Principal|principal]] in the event of a call. With a make-whole call, the investor gets the NPV of future payments.

There is actually a case where a [[Make-Whole Call Provision|make-whole call provision]] provides no benefits. Consider an investor who buys a bond at par value when it is first issued. If the bond is immediately called, then the investor gets the [[Principal|principal]] back and can reinvest it at the same prevailing [[open-market rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market-rate.asp). The investor does not need any additional payments to be made whole.

The advantages of make-whole calls are most apparent after interest rates fall. Once again, we can start with an investor who bought a bond at par value when it was first issued. This time, suppose interest rates decline from 10% to 5% after the investor holds a 20-year bond for ten years. If this investor receives only the [[Principal|principal]] back, the investor [[Will|will]] have to reinvest at the lower 5% rate. In this case, the NPV of future payments provided by a [[Make-Whole Call Provision|make-whole call provision]] compensates the investor for having to reinvest at a lower rate.

Investors in the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp) are also aware of the value of make-whole call provisions. All other things being equal, bonds with make-whole call provisions [[Will|will]] typically trade [[at a premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-a-[[Premium|premium]].asp) to those with standard call provisions. Investors pay less money for bonds with standard call provisions because they have more [[call risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callrisk.asp).
