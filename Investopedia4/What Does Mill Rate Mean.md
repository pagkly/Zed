[[What Does Mill Rate Mean]]?
## What Is the Mill Rate?

The mill rate is the amount of tax payable per dollar of the assessed value of a property. The mill rate is based on "mills." It is a figure that represents the amount per $1,000 of the [[assessed value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assessedvalue.asp) of the property, which is used to calculate the amount of property tax.

### Key Takeaways

-   Mill rate is a tax rate—the amount of tax payable per dollar of the assessed value of a property.
-   Mill is derived from the Latin word _millesimum_, meaning thousandth.
-   As used in property tax, 1 mill is equal to $1 in property tax levied per $1,000 of a property's assessed value.
-   Government entities set mill rates based on the total value of property within their jurisdiction, to provide the necessary tax revenue to cover projected expenses—roads, schools, emergency services, and so on—in their annual budgets.
-   Property taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed, taxable property value by the mill rate and then dividing that sum by 1,000.

## Understanding Mill Rate

Mill rate is also known as the millage rate. The term "millage" is derived from a Latin word _millesimum,_ meaning thousandth, with 1 mill being equal to 1/1000th of a currency unit. As used in relation to property tax, 1 mill is equal to $1 in property tax, which is levied per $1,000 of a property's determined taxable value.

You can find the millage rate for an individual property on the property [[deed]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deed.asp) itself or by calling your municipal tax office.  

## Where Does the Mill Rate Come From?

The mill rate for your property is determined by who or what is taxing you. That means that different mill rates are charged by different agencies, including the township/city, the county, school boards, and/or emergency services districts. These are all combined to help calculate your final property tax bill. 

For example, once a budget is passed by your local government, known [[revenues]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp) are subtracted, which leaves the deficit to be raised through property taxes. This amount is divided by the value of all property in the town, which is then multiplied by 1,000. This figure represents the tax rate or the mill rate. 

## Calculating Property Taxes Using the Mill Rate

[Property taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/propertytax.asp) are calculated by multiplying the assessed, taxable property value by the mill rate and then dividing that sum by 1,000.1 The calculation formula is rendered as follows:

**Property tax levied on property = (mill rate x taxable property value) ÷ 1,000**

For example, if the mill rate is 7 and a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]'s personal residence has a taxable value of $150,000, then, using the calculation formula, the homeowner's property tax bill for his residence is $1,050. So that means that for every $1,000 of assessed value, $7 is owed in property taxes. 

## How Property Taxes Are Determined

Property taxes are critical to funding the operations of municipal and other local government entities. Not all states levy income taxes, but all states do levy property taxes. Property owners are commonly assessed property taxes by more than one government entity, such as a municipality and a county.

Government entities set mill rates based on the total value of property within the entity's jurisdiction, to provide the necessary tax revenue to cover projected expenses in their annual [[budgets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp), including things such as [[infrastructure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp), police and emergency services, and public schools. For this reason, and also because of fluctuating real [[Estate|estate]] values, a tax assessor typically updates the taxable value of the property annually. Mill rates frequently vary for different types of property, such as residential, commercial, or industrial properties.

Property tax is an [[ad valorem tax]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advaloremtax.asp), which means it is based on value. The assessed tax value of the property is calculated using local real [[Estate|estate]] data and is usually a percentage of a property's [[fair market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp), determined by multiplying the property's market value or appraisal value by an assessment ratio established by the local taxing authority. However, it is possible for the assessed tax value to be either higher or lower than a property's actual market value. If a property owner believes that his property has been assessed at an unreasonably high value, he can request a [[reassessment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reassessment.asp).

Some states have a [[homestead provision]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homestead-exemption.asp) that exempts a specified dollar amount of a property's market value from assessment for property taxes.2 For example, in a state with a $50,000 homestead provision, only $150,000 of a $200,000 home would be subject to property taxes.
