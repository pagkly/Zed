[[QQQQ]]
## What Is [[QQQQ]]?

The [[QQQQ]] is the original ticker symbol for the [[Nasdaq]] 100 Trust, an [[ETF]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) that trades on the Nasdaq exchange. This [[Security|security]] offers broad exposure to the tech sector by tracking the [[Nasdaq 100 Index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq100.asp), which consists of the 100 largest and most actively traded non-financial [[Stocks|stocks]] on the Nasdaq. It is also known as "cubes" or the "quadruple-Qs" and is now [[Listed|listed]] under the Invesco QQQ Trust or its current ticker symbol: QQQ.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[QQQQ]] is the original ticker symbol for the [[Nasdaq]] 100 Trust, an ETF that trades on the Nasdaq exchange. 
-   This ETF offers broad exposure to the tech sector by tracking the [[Nasdaq 100 Index]], which tracks the 100 largest and most actively traded non-financial [[Stocks|stocks]] on the [[Nasdaq]]. 
-   This ETF excludes financial services names.
-   The ETF, whose current ticker symbol is QQQ, is also known as "cubes" or the "quadruple-Qs."

## Understanding [[QQQQ]]

Although the [[QQQQ]] is now traded through the Invesco QQQ Trust, it still tracks the [[Nasdaq]] 100, a [[Stock|stock]] index listing the 100 largest Nasdaq companies by market cap. The [[Nasdaq 100 Index|Nasdaq 100 index]] comprises companies from all sectors, with the exception of financial services. These industries include retail, biotechnology, industrial, technology, health care, and many others. This fund provides an especially viable investment choice for investors seeking exposure to the tech sector, because many of the largest companies [[Listed|listed]] on the Nasdaq are [[blue-chip]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechip.asp) tech behemoths such as Google ([GOOGL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=googl)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=msft)), and Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=qcom)).

## Requirements for Inclusion in the Invesco QQQ Trust

All companies in the Invesco QQQ Trust must be [[Listed|listed]] on the [[Nasdaq]] 100 exchange for at least two years. But there are certain exceptions to this rule. Namely, certain companies that have been listed for only one year but have extraordinarily high [[market capitalizations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) may make the cut. All [[Stocks|stocks]] need to have an [[average daily trading volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averagedailytradingvolume.asp) of 200,000 [[Shares|shares]], and they are likewise required to report earnings on both quarterly and annual bases. Companies with bankruptcy issues are omitted from the Invesco QQQ Trust.

In 1999, this ETF began as a side project created by a few [[Nasdaq]] employees who sought to help mom-and-pop investors participate in the dotcom boom.

## A Granular Breakdown of the Invesco QQQ Trust

The Invesco QQQ Trust is extremely tech-forward, with 54.72% of its assets allocated to the technology sector. [[Consumer cyclicals]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer_cyclicals.asp) are the next highest [[Weighted|weighted]] sector, with a 21.27% allocation. Meanwhile, the health care sector rounds out the top three silos, with a 13.52% allocation. All other sectors have less than a 10% allocation within the ETF, with consumer non-cyclicals, industrials, and telecommunications rounding out the top six sectors represented.

It's no surprise then that eight of the Invesco QQQ Trust's top 10 company [[Holdings|holdings]] are notable tech stalwarts such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Intel, and Cisco. It's worth noting the Invesco QQQ Trust tracks a limited number of [[Stocks|stocks]] compared to other [[Nasdaq]] ETFs. Case in point: the popular [[Nasdaq Composite Index]] (IXIC) tracks every [[Stock|stock]] [[Listed|listed]] on the Nasdaq, including financial services names, which amounts to more than 3,000 public companies.
