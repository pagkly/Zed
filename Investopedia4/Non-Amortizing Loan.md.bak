[[Non-Amortizing Loan]]
## What Is a [[Non-Amortizing Loan]]?

A [[Non-Amortizing Loan|non-amortizing loan]] is a type of [[Loan|loan]] for which payments on the [[Principal|principal]] are made by lump sum. As a result, the value of the principal does not decrease at all over the life of the loan. Popular types of non-amortizing loans include [[interest-only]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestonlymortgage.asp) loans or [[balloon-payment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balloon-payment.asp) loans.

### Key Takeaways:

-   A [[Non-Amortizing Loan|non-amortizing loan]] is a type of [[Loan|loan]] for which payments on the [[Principal|principal]] are paid in a lump sum.
-   The value of the [[Loan|loan]] [[Principal|principal]] does not decrease over the life of the loan.
-   Interest-only and balloon-payment loans are popular types of non-amortizing loans.

## Understanding [[Non-Amortizing Loan]]

A [[Non-Amortizing Loan|non-amortizing loan]] has no [[amortization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp) schedule because the [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) is paid off in a single lump sum. Non-amortizing loans are an alternative type of lending product as most standard loans involve an amortization schedule that determines the monthly principal and interest paid toward a [[Loan|loan]] each month.

Non-amortizing loans require their [[Principal|principal]] to be paid back in one lump sum rather than through regular installments and usually feature a short duration and a high-interest rate.

Generally, non-amortizing loans require higher [[interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) because they are usually [[unsecured]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Unsecured|unsecured]].asp) and [[Offer|offer]] lower installment payments, reducing the [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] to the [[Lender|lender]]. Since they do not have a basic amortization schedule, non-amortizing loans can be more complex for a lender to structure. If any installment payments are made, they must be tracked individually and recorded separately from the [[Principal|principal]]. If a balloon payment is made, the lender must determine the interest to be collected with the lump sum when the payment is due.

## Types of Non-Amortizing Loans

[Balloon mortgages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balloon-mortgage.asp), [[interest-only loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestonlymortgage.asp), and [[deferred-interest programs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredinterest.asp) are three general types of [[Loan|loan]] products that a borrower can look to for [[Non-Amortizing Loan|non-amortizing loan]] benefits. These loans do not require any [[Principal|principal]] to be paid in installment payments during the life of the loan.

Some loans may require only the interest payment in installments while others defer both the [[Principal|principal]] and interest. These loans are typically for a short duration, as the deferred payment results in higher [[Risk|risk]] for the [[Lender|lender]]. They are also not typically considered qualified loans, a status that would allow them to receive certain protections and be resold in the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp).

## How Do Borrowers Use Non-Amortizing Loans?

Non-amortizing loans are commonly used in land contracts and real [[Estate|estate]] development financing. In these situations, borrowers typically have limited immediate [[Collateral|collateral]] that can be used specifically when a residential or commercial building is being built on a tract of land.

A [[Non-Amortizing Loan|non-amortizing loan]] provides the borrower with a specific amount of time to build a property, after which the borrower can potentially refinance or obtain a [[takeout loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/take-out-[[Loan|loan]].asp) with better loan terms using the newly built property as the [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp).

These types of loans proliferated in the era preceding the [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] of 2008 when rogue mortgage industry practices became widely used to lure consumers to take on mortgages beyond their affordability.

## Special Considerations

Generally, non-amortizing loans can serve borrowers in special situations. These loans give a borrower a specified timeframe within which to repay the [[Principal|principal]] without the need for monthly installment payments. This can help borrowers who plan to save on their own over the life of the [[Loan|loan]]. These products can also target borrowers who have prospects for increasing their monthly income during the loan’s timeframe.
