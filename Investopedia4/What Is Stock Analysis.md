[[What Is Stock Analysis]]?
## [[What Is Stock Analysis]]?

[[Stock]] analysis is the evaluation of a particular trading instrument, an investment sector, or the market as a whole. Stock analysts attempt to determine the future activity of an instrument, sector, or market.

## Understanding [[Stock]] Analysis

[[Stock]] analysis is a method for investors and traders to make buying and selling decisions. By studying and evaluating past and current data, investors and traders attempt to [[Gain|gain]] an edge in the markets by making informed decisions.

## [[Fundamental Analysis]]

There are two basic types of [[Stock|stock]] analysis: [[fundamental analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) and [[technical analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp). [[Fundamental Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] concentrates on data from sources, including financial records, economic reports, company assets, and market share. To conduct fundamental analysis on a public company or sector, investors and analysts typically analyze the metrics on a company’s [[financial statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) – [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp), [[income statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp), [[cash flow statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp), and [[footnotes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/footnote.asp). These statements are released to the public in the form of a [10-Q](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10q.asp) or [10-K report](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-k.asp) through the database system, [[EDGAR]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/edgar.asp), which is administered by the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC). Also, the earnings report released by a company during its quarterly earnings press release is analyzed by investors who look to ascertain how much in revenue, expenses, and profits a company made.

When running [[Stock|stock]] analysis on a company’s financial statements, an analyst [[Will|will]] usually be checking for the measure of a company’s profitability, [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp), [[solvency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solvency.asp), efficiency, growth trajectory, and [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp). Different ratios can be used to determine how healthy a company is. For example, the [[current ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp) and [[quick ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quickratio.asp) are used to estimate whether a company will be able to pay its [[short-term liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp) with its available [[current assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp). The formula for [[Current Ratio|current ratio]] is calculated by dividing [[Current Assets|current assets]] by [[current liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp), figures that can be gotten from the balance sheet. Although, there is no such thing as an ideal current ratio, a ratio less than 1 could indicate to the stock analyst that the company is in poor financial health and may not be able to cover its short-term [[Debt|debt]] obligations when they come due.

Looking at the balance sheet still, a [[Stock|stock]] analyst may want to know the current [[Debt|debt]] levels taken on by a company. In this case, a stock analyst may use the [[debt ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtratio.asp), which is calculated by dividing [[total liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/total-liabilities.asp) by total assets. A [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] above 1 typically means that a company has more debt than assets. In this case, if the company has a high [[degree of leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcl.asp), a stock analyst may conclude that a rise in interest rates may increase the company’s probability of going into [[Default|default]].

[[Stock]] analysis involves comparing a company’s current financial statement to its financial statements in previous years to give an investor a sense of whether the company is growing, stable, or deteriorating. The financial statement of a company can also be compared to that of one or more other companies within the same industry. A stock analyst may be looking to compare the [[operating profit margin]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp) of two competing companies, by looking at their income statements. The [[Operating Profit|operating profit]] margin is a metric that shows how much revenue is left after [[operating expenses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp) have been paid and what portion of revenue is left to cover [[non-operating costs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-operating-expense.asp) and is calculated as operating income divided by revenue. A company with an [[Operating Margin|operating margin]] of 0.30 [[Will|will]] be looked on more favorably than one with a margin of 0.03. A 0.30 operating margin means that for every dollar of revenue, a company has 30 cents left after operating costs have been covered. In other words, the company uses 70 cents out of every dollar in [[Net Sales|net sales]] to pay for its variable or operating costs.

## [[Technical Analysis]]

The second method of [[Stock|stock]] analysis is [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]]. Technical analysis focuses on the study of past and present [[Price Action|price action]] to predict the probability of future price movements. Technical analysts analyze the financial market as a whole and are primarily concerned with price and volume, as well as the demand and [[Supply|supply]] factors that move the market. Charts are a key tool for technical analysts as they show a graphical illustration of a stock’s [[trend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp) within a stated time period. For example, using a chart, a technical analyst may mark certain areas as a [[support]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp) or [[resistance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp) level. The support levels are marked by previous lows below the [[current trading price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp), and the resistance markers are placed at previous highs above the current [[market price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) of the stock. A break below the support level would indicate a [[bearish trend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) to the stock analyst, while a break above the resistance level would take on a [[bullish outlook]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp).

Technical [[Stock|stock]] analysis is effective only when [[Supply|supply]] and demand forces influence the price trend analyzed. When outside factors are involved in a price movement, analyzing [[Stocks|stocks]] using [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] may not be successful. Examples of factors, other than supply and demand, that can affect a stock price include [[stock splits]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksplit.asp), mergers, [[dividend announcements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/announcment-effect.asp), a [[class action]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/classaction.asp) lawsuit, death of a company’s CEO, a terrorist attack, [[accounting scandals]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-shenanigans.asp), change of management, [[monetary policy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) changes, etc.

Both fundamental and [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] can be done independently or together. Some analysts use both methods of analysis, while others stick to one. Either way, using [[Stock|stock]] analysis to [[vet stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vetting.asp), sectors, and the market is an important method of creating the best investment strategy for one’s [[Portfolio|portfolio]].
