[[Mezzanine Debt]]
## What Is [[Mezzanine Debt]]?

[[Mezzanine Debt|Mezzanine debt]] occurs when a hybrid [[Debt Issue|debt issue]] is subordinated to another [[Debt|debt]] issue from the same issuer. Mezzanine debt has embedded [[Equity|equity]] instruments attached, often known as warrants, which increase the value of the subordinated debt and allow greater flexibility when dealing with bondholders. Mezzanine debt is frequently associated with acquisitions and buyouts, for which it may be used to prioritize new owners ahead of existing owners in case of bankruptcy.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Mezzanine Debt|Mezzanine debt]] is when a hybrid [[Debt Issue|debt issue]] is subordinate to another [[Debt|debt]] issue from the same issuer.
-   [[Mezzanine Debt|Mezzanine debt]] bridges the gap between [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] financing and is one of the highest-[[Risk|risk]] forms of debt—being subordinate to pure debt but senior to pure equity.
-   In practice, [[Mezzanine Debt|mezzanine debt]] behaves more like a [[Stock|stock]] than [[Debt|debt]] because the embedded options make the conversion of the debt into stock very attractive.
-   [[Mezzanine Debt|Mezzanine debt]] offers some of the highest returns when compared to other [[Debt|debt]] types, often generating rates between 12% and 20% per year.

## Understanding [[Mezzanine Debt]]

[[Mezzanine Debt|Mezzanine debt]] bridges the gap between [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtfinancing.asp) and [[equity financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityfinancing.asp) and is one of the highest-[[Risk|risk]] forms of [[Debt|debt]]. It is senior to pure [[Equity|equity]] but subordinate to pure debt. However, this means that it also offers some of the highest returns when compared to other debt types, as it often receives rates between 12% and 20% per year.

## Types of [[Mezzanine Debt]]

The types of [[Equity|equity]] included with the [[Debt|debt]] can be many. Some examples of [[embedded options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/embeddedoption.asp) include [[Stock|stock]] [[call options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), [[rights, and warrants]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/062713/investing-stock-rights-and-warrants.asp). In practice, [[Mezzanine Debt|mezzanine debt]] behaves more like a stock than debt because the embedded options make the conversion of the debt into stock very attractive.

[[Mezzanine Debt|Mezzanine debt]] structures are most common in [[leveraged buyouts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp). For example, a private [[Equity|equity]] firm may seek to purchase a company for $100 million with [[Debt|debt]], but the [[Lender|lender]] only wants to put up 80% of the value, [[Offering|offering]] a [[Loan|loan]] of $80 million. The private equity firm does not want to put up $20 million of its own capital and instead looks for a mezzanine investor to [[Finance|finance]] $15 million.

Then, the firm only has to invest $5 million of its own dollars to meet the $100 million price tag. Since the investor used [[Mezzanine Debt|mezzanine debt]], he'll be able to convert the [[Debt|debt]] to [[Equity|equity]] when certain requirements are met. Using this method of financing leverages the buyer's potential [[Return|return]] while minimizing the amount of capital it has to put up for the transaction. 

Under U.S. [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)]], a [[hybrid security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hybridsecurity.asp) classification on the balance sheet is dependent on how the embedded option is influenced by the [[Debt|debt]] portion. If the act of exercising the embedded option is influenced by the structure of the debt in any way, then the two parts of the hybrid - the debt and the embedded [[Equity|equity]] option—must be classified in both the [[Liability|liability]] and [[stockholders' equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockholdersequity.asp) sections of the balance sheet.

## Example of [[Mezzanine Debt]]

[[Mezzanine Debt|Mezzanine debt]] is most often used in [[mergers and acquisitions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) (M&A). For example, in 2016, Olympus Partners, a private [[Equity|equity]] firm based in Conn., received [[Debt Financing|debt financing]] from Antares Capital to acquire AmSpec Holding Corp, a company that provides testing, inspection, and certification services for [[Petroleum|petroleum]] traders and refiners.

The total amount of the financing was $215 million, which included a [[revolving credit facility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revolving-[[Loan|loan]]-facility.asp), a [[term loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termloan.asp), and a [[delayed draw term loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delayeddrawtermloan.asp). Antares Capital provided the total capital in the form of [[Mezzanine Debt|mezzanine debt]], thus, giving it [[Equity|equity]] options.
