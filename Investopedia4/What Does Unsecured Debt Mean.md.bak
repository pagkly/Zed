[[What Does Unsecured Debt Mean]]?
## What Is [[Unsecured]] [[Debt]]?

[[Unsecured]] [[Debt|debt]] refers to loans that are not backed by [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp). If the borrower [[defaults]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on the [[Loan|loan]], the [[Lender|lender]] may not be able to recover their investment because the borrower is not required to pledge any specific assets as [[Security|security]] for the loan.

Because [[Unsecured|unsecured]] loans are considered riskier for the [[Lender|lender]], they generally carry higher [[interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) than collateralized loans.1

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Unsecured]] debts are loans that are not collateralized.
-   They generally require higher interest rates, because they [[Offer|offer]] the [[Lender|lender]] limited protection against [[Default|default]].
-   Lenders can mitigate this [[Risk|risk]] by reporting defaults to credit [[Rating|rating]] agencies, contracting with credit collection agencies, and selling their loans on the secondary market.

## Understanding [[Unsecured]] [[Debt]]

A [[Loan|loan]] is [[Unsecured|unsecured]] if it is not backed by any [[Underlying|underlying]] assets. Examples of unsecured [[Debt|debt]] include [[credit cards]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp), [[medical bills]](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/medical-debt-what-do-when-you-cant-pay/), utility bills, and other instances in which credit was given without any [[Collateral|collateral]] requirement.2

[[Unsecured]] loans are particularly risky for lenders because the borrower might choose to [[Default|default]] on the [[Loan|loan]] through [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp). In this situation, the [[Lender|lender]] can seek to sue the borrower for repayment of the loan. However, if no specific assets were pledged as [[Collateral|collateral]], the lender may be unable to recover their initial investment.

Because [[Unsecured|unsecured]] loans are considered more risky for the [[Lender|lender]], they generally carry higher interest rates than collateralized loans.

Although bankruptcy can allow borrowers to avoid repaying their debts, it is not without its consequences. Borrowers who have declared bankruptcy in the past may find it difficult or impossible to secure new loans in the future, since the bankruptcy [[Will|will]] have a severe negative impact on their [[Credit Score|credit score]], likely for many years to come.

Lenders, meanwhile, may seek alternative methods for recovering their investment. In addition to suing the borrower, lenders can also report any instances of [[Default|default]] or delinquency to a credit [[Rating|rating]] agency. Alternatively, the [[Lender|lender]] can also hire a credit [[collection agency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collectionagency.asp) that [[Will|will]] then seek to collect the unpaid [[Debt|debt]].

## Real-World Example of [[Unsecured]] [[Debt]]

Max is a private [[Lender|lender]] specializing in [[Unsecured|unsecured]] loans. He is approached by a new borrower, Elysse, who wishes to borrow $20,000.

Because the [[Loan|loan]] is [[Unsecured|unsecured]], Elysse is not required to pledge any specific assets as [[Collateral|collateral]] in case she defaults on the loan. As compensation for this [[Risk|risk]], Max charges her an interest rate that is higher than rates associated with collateralized loans.

Six months later, the [[Loan|loan]] becomes delinquent due to a series of late and missed payments by Elysse. Max has several options to consider:

Although Max could seek to sue Elysse for repayment of the [[Loan|loan]], he suspects this would not be worthwhile because there are no specific assets pledged as [[Collateral|collateral]]. As an alternative, he chooses to hire a [[Collection Agency|collection agency]] to pursue repayment of the loan on his behalf. As compensation for this service, Max agrees to pay the collection agency a percentage of any amount that the collection agency succeeds in recovering.Â Collection agencies charge on a [[Contingency|contingency]] fee basis. Collection rates vary by collection type, size, and age. They average between 7.5% and 50% for each account, with consumer rates typically around 35%.3

Another option: Max could have sold the [[Debt|debt]] to another investor using the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041515/why-do-we-need-secondary-market.asp). In that scenario, he would have likely sold the debt at a considerable discount to its face value. In exchange for the discounted [[Purchase Price|purchase price]], the new investor would assume the [[Risk|risk]] of not being repaid.
