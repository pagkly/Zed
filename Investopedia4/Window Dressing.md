[[Window Dressing]]
## What Is [[Window Dressing]]?

[[Window Dressing|Window dressing]] is a strategy used by [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) and other [[portfolio managers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanager.asp) to improve the appearance of a fund’s performance before presenting it to clients or shareholders. To window dress, the fund manager sells [[Stocks|stocks]] with large losses and purchases high-flying stocks near the end of the quarter or year. These securities are then reported as part of the fund's [[Holdings|holdings]].

The term can also refer to actions taken by companies to improve their forthcoming [[financial statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp), such as by postponing payments or finding ways to book [[revenues]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp) earlier.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Window Dressing|Window dressing]] occurs when [[Portfolio|portfolio]] managers try to boost a fund’s investment performance prior to investor or shareholder presentations.
-   It can be identified by carefully evaluating a firm or fund's financial statements and looking for suspicious trades coinciding with the end of a quarter or fiscal year.
-   [[Window Dressing|Window dressing]] can give the appearance of better returns, but these strategies often simply defer losses that [[Will|will]] materialize later on.

## How [[Window Dressing]] Works

Performance reports and a list of the [[holdings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Holdings|holdings]].asp) in a mutual fund are usually sent to clients every quarter, and clients use these reports to monitor the fund's investment returns. When performance has been lagging, mutual fund managers may use [[Window Dressing|window dressing]], selling [[Stocks|stocks]] that have reported substantial losses and replacing them with stocks expected to produce [[short-term gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short-term-[[Gain|gain]].asp) to improve the overall performance of the fund for the reporting period.

Another variation of [[Window Dressing|window dressing]] is investing in [[Stocks|stocks]] that do not meet the style of the mutual fund. For example, a [[precious metals]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preciousmetal.asp) fund might invest in stocks in a hot sector at the time, disguising the fund's [[Holdings|holdings]] and investing outside the [[Scope|scope]] of the fund’s investment strategy.

## Example of [[Window Dressing]]

A fund investing in [[Stocks|stocks]] exclusively from the [[S&P 500]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) has underperformed the index. Stocks A and B outperformed the total index but were [[underweight]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underweight|underweight]].asp) in the fund, while stocks C and D were overweight in the fund but lagged the index.

To make it look like the fund was investing in [[Stocks|stocks]] A and B all along, the [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] sells out of stocks C and D, replacing them with, and giving an [[overweight]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overweight.asp) to, stocks A and B.

The act of [[Window Dressing|window dressing]] is under close watch by investment researchers and regulators with potentially forthcoming rules that could require more immediate and greater transparency of [[Holdings|holdings]] at the end of a reporting period.

## Monitor Your Fund Performance

For investors, [[Window Dressing|window dressing]] provides another good reason to monitor your fund performance reports closely. Some [[fund managers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundmanager.asp) might try to improve returns through window dressing, which means investors should be cautious of [[Holdings|holdings]] that seem out of line with the fund’s overall strategy.

Investors should pay close attention to [[Holdings|holdings]] that appear outside of a fund’s strategy.

[[Window Dressing|Window dressing]] can boost a fund’s returns in the short term, although longer-term effects on a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] are typically negative. While these [[Holdings|holdings]] may show higher short-term performance, in the long run these types of investments drag on the [[portfolio’s returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Return|return]].asp), and a [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] cannot often hide poor performance for long. Investors [[Will|will]] certainly identify these types of investments, and the result is often lower confidence in the fund manager and increased fund outflows.

## Who Engages in [[Window Dressing]]

Though [[disclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disclosure.asp) rules are intended to aid in increasing transparency for investors, [[Window Dressing|window dressing]] can still obscure the practices of the fund manager. A study by Iwan Meier and Ernst Schaumburg of Northwestern University found that certain characteristics of a fund can signal that the manager may be engaging in window dressing. Specifically, [[growth funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthfund.asp) with high turnover and a manager who has recently posted poor returns are more often the ones who [[Will|will]] window dress. 

[[Window Dressing|Window dressing]] also occurs across various other industries. For instance, companies can [[Offer|offer]] products at discounted prices or promote special deals that enhance sales for the end of the period. These promotional efforts seek to increase the [[Return|return]] in the final days of a reporting period.
