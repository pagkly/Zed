Overlay: A Way to Keep Separate Accounts on the Same Page
## What Is Overlay?

Overlay refers to a management style that harmonizes an investor's separately [[managed accounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/managedaccount.asp). Overlay management uses software to track an investor's combined position from separate accounts. The overlay system analyzes any [[Portfolio|portfolio]] adjustments to ensure the overall [[portfolio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) remains in balance and to prevent any inefficient transactions from occurring. Overlay portfolio management makes sure the investor’s strategies are implemented and coordinated successfully.

Overlay [[Portfolio|portfolio]] management is often used with the portfolios of institutional investors and ultra-high [[Net Worth|net worth]] individuals. Money managers and financial advisors employ it to oversee and track the various investor accounts in their care.

### Key Takeaways

-   Overlay refers to an asset management style that uses software to harmonize an investor's separately managed accounts.
-   The overlay system analyzes any [[Portfolio|portfolio]] adjustments to ensure the overall portfolio remains in balance, preventing inefficiencies and coordinating efforts in line with a client's tax situation and [[Risk|risk]] tolerance.
-   Overlay often involves the assets being combined in a unified management [[Portfolio|portfolio]], overseen by a manager, to whom individual asset managers make recommendations.

## How Overlay Works

When an investor has separately managed portfolios, [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) are placed under the control of different managers. This set-up can cause inefficiencies if the managers begin making transactions that either increase the [[Risk|risk]] of the overall [[Portfolio|portfolio]], have negative tax effects, unbalance the investor's positions, or work at cross purposes. For example, if one of the separately managed account traders purchases an asset, and another trader sells it, the investor is left with a [[Neutral|neutral]] position and two transaction fees.

Overlay management seeks to improve the communication between the separate managers, allowing for increases in transaction efficiency. In traditional separately managed account structures, clients' capital is delegated to multiple outside managers to invest, but in an  
overlay system, the assets—and the ultimate responsibility—stay together  
in a unified managed account. Overlay portfolios should have a stated purpose and specific guidelines to avoid issues arising. For instance, the overlay manager may determine maximum allocations across an entire [[Portfolio|portfolio]] or require that investments are made in a particular asset class.

As a [[pamphlet from Ostrum (formerly Natixis) Asset Management]](https://www.myirionline.org/docs/[[Default|default]]-source/research/natixis-global-asset-management--an-introduction-to-overlay-[[Portfolio|portfolio]]-management.pdf?sfvrsn=0) charmingly puts it;

> In some ways, the role of the overlay manager is analogous to that of an orchestra conductor. The overlay manager (conductor) coordinates the activities of the [[Underlying|underlying]] managers (musicians) to ensure a harmonious outcome.

## Advantages of Overlay [[Portfolio]] Management

-   **[[Rebalancing]]**: An overlay manager ensures an investor’s total [[Holdings|holdings]] are rebalanced when necessary. For example, an investor may want a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] allocation of 30% equities, 30% [[fixed income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) and 20% cash. If these asset classes are held in three different accounts, the overlay manager makes adjustments to maintain these allocations.                                                     
-   **[[Risk]] Management:** Risk can be managed more effectively using an overlay manager. Portfolios that [[Hold|hold]] different asset classes, investment types and hedging strategies can be monitored to make sure the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is remaining within the investor’s risk parameters. For example, if an investor is employing a [[long/short investment strategy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-shortequity.asp) through different trading accounts, an overlay manager can monitor the overall net exposure.                                                                                   
-   **Tax Management:** Overlay managers can monitor capital gains and losses across an investor’s separate accounts to help manage their tax obligations. For instance, an overlay manager may decide to sell a losing investment in one account to partially offset a large capital [[Gain|gain]] in another account.                             
-   **Simplicity:** Overlay [[Portfolio|portfolio]] management makes a complex multi-investment strategy easy to implement. Accounts can be consolidated into a single master portfolio, with a single statement, to minimize paperwork and client compliance agreements. If the investor has a query about a portfolio, they have a single point of contact.

Pros

-   Professional asset management and allocation
    
-   Near-automatic [[Rebalancing|rebalancing]], [[Risk|risk]] management
    
-   Tax management
    
-   Single contact for investor
    

Cons

-   Time-consuming to establish
    
-   Compliance approval needed
    
-   Ongoing communication, meetings
    
-   Accounts, assets all at one firm
    

## Limitations of Overlay [[Portfolio]] Management

If the different portfolios have complex investment strategies, an overlay system may be time-consuming to set up. Gathering documentation from various fund managers and understanding their approach toward [[Portfolio|portfolio]] construction and [[risk management]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042815/what-difference-between-expected-[[Return|return]]-and-standard-deviation-portfolio.asp) may require numerous meetings to ensure effective coordination—not just initially, but ongoing.

Also, an overlay [[Portfolio|portfolio]] typically needs to be approved by various compliance departments before it can be established.

## Real-World Example of Overlay

Many wealth/asset management firms and trust companies [[Offer|offer]] overlay services to their clients. Piper Jaffray is one such. Clients who opt for a Unified Managed Account are assigned an overlay [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]], who has responsibility for the day-to-day management of the assets, based on the client's stated goals, needs, preferences, [[Risk|risk]] tolerance, etc. This manager, in turn, receives investment advice from other investment managers in the form of a model [[Portfolio|portfolio]]—a recommendation of specific securities and transactions. The overlay portfolio manager decides whether or not to execute these recommendations, and to what degree, in line with the client's tax situation, current asset allocation, and degree of aggressiveness.
