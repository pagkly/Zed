[[Vertical Integration]]
## What Is [[Vertical Integration]]?

[[Vertical Integration|Vertical integration]] is a strategy whereby a company owns or controls its suppliers, distributors or retail locations to control its value or [[Supply|supply]] chain. Vertical integration benefits companies by allowing them to control process, reduce costs and improve efficiencies. However, vertical integration has disadvantages, including the significant amounts of capital investment required.

Netflix is a prime example of [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]]. The company started as a DVD rental business before moving into online streaming of films and movies licensed from major studios. Then, Netflix executives realized they could improve their margins by producing their own original content. Today, Netflix uses its distribution model to promote its original content alongside programming licensed from studios.1

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Vertical Integration|Vertical integration]] is when a company owns or controls its suppliers, distributors or retail locations to control its value or [[Supply|supply]] chain.
-   [[Vertical Integration|Vertical integration]] benefits companies by allowing them to control the process, reduce costs and improve efficiencies.
-   Backward integration is when a company expands backward on the production path into [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]].
-   Forward integration is when companies control the direct distribution or [[Supply|supply]] of their products. 

## Understanding [[Vertical Integration]]

[[Vertical Integration|Vertical integration]] occurs when a company takes control over several of the production steps involved in the creation of a product or service. In other words, vertical integration involves purchasing and bringing in-house a part of the production or sales process that was previously outsourced. Typically, a company's [[Supply|supply]] chain or sales process begins with the purchase of raw materials from a supplier and ends with the sale of the final product to the customer.

Companies can integrate by purchasing their suppliers to reduce [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] costs. They can also invest in the retail or sales end of the process by opening physical stores and locations to provide after-sales service. Controlling the distribution process is another common [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] strategy, meaning companies control the warehousing and delivery of their products.

## Types of [[Vertical Integration]]

There are various strategies companies use to control multiple segments of the [[Supply|supply]] chain. Two of the most common include backward and forward integration.

### Backward Integration

[Backward integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backwardintegration.asp) is when a company expands backward on the production path into [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]], meaning a retailer buys the manufacturer of their product. An example might be Amazon [(AMZN)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=AMZN), which expanded from an online retailer of books to become a publisher with its Kindle platform.2 Amazon also owns warehouses and parts of its distribution channel.3

### Forward Integration

[Forward integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardintegration.asp) is when a company expands by purchasing and controlling the direct distribution or [[Supply|supply]] of its products. A clothing manufacturer that opens its own retail locations to sell product is an example of forward integration. Forward integration helps companies _cut out the middleman._ By removing distributors that would typically be paid to sell a company's products, overall profitability is improved.

An example of [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] is a mortgage company that originates and services mortgages. The company lends money to homebuyers and collects their monthly payments, rather than specializing in one of the services.

Another example of [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] is a solar power company that produces photovoltaic products and also manufactures the cells used to create those products. In doing so, the company moved along the [[Supply|supply]] chain to assume the [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] duties, conducting backward integration.

Although [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] can reduce costs and create a more efficient [[Supply|supply]] chain, the capital expenditures involved can be significant.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of [[Vertical Integration]]

[[Vertical Integration|Vertical integration]] can help companies reduce costs and improve efficiencies. However, there are some disadvantages to implementing a vertical integration strategy.

### Advantages

Below are the benefits of [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]]:

-   Decreased [[transportation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transportationexpenses.asp) costs and reduced delivery turnaround times
-   Reduced [[Supply|supply]] disruptions from suppliers that might fall into financial hardship
-   Increased competitiveness by getting products to consumers directly and quickly
-   Lower costs through [[Economies of Scale|economies of scale]]. By buying large quantities of raw materials or streamlining the [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] process, per-unit costs are lowered
-   Improved sales and profitability by creating and selling a company-owned brand

### Disadvantages

Below are disadvantages to [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]]:

-   Companies might get too big and mismanage the overall process
-   Outsourcing to suppliers and vendors might be more efficient if their expertise is superior
-   Costs of [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] such as purchasing a supplier can be significant
-   Increased amounts of [[Debt|debt]] if borrowing is needed for capital expenditures

## Real-World Examples of [[Vertical Integration]]

An example of [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] is technology giant Apple [(AAPL)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL), which has retail locations to sell product as well as [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] facilities around the globe. For example, in 2012 Apple acquired AuthenTec, which makes the touch ID fingerprint sensor that go into its iPhones.4 5 In 2015, [[Apple opened a laboratory in Taiwan]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-15/apple-said-to-open-secret-lab-in-taiwan-to-develop-displays) for developing LCD and OLED screen technologies. It also [[paid $18.2 million for a 70,000-square-foot manufacturing facility]](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/12/14/exclusive-apple-buys-former-chip-fab-in-north-san.html) in North San Jose that same year. These investments, among others, allow Apple to move along the [[Supply|supply]] chain in backward integration, providing flexibility and freedom in its manufacturing.

However, the company still has suppliers that include Analog Devices ([ADI](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=ADI)), which provides touchscreen controllers for iPhones. Also, Jabil Circuit supplies phone casings for Apple from its [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] facilities in China.6

The company has also integrated forward as much as backward. Apart from Best Buy and other carefully selected retailers, Apple products are almost exclusively sold at company-owned locations. This allows Apple to tightly control distribution and sale to the end consumer.

### Live Nation and Ticketmaster

The merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster in 2010 created a vertically integrated entertainment company that manages and represents artists, produces shows and sells event tickets. The combined entity manages and owns concert venues, while also selling tickets to the events at those venues.7 The integration is an example of forward integration from the perspective of Ticketmaster, and backward integration from the perspective of Live Nation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When is an acquisition considered [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]]?

[[Vertical Integration|Vertical integration]] occurs when a company acquires a supplier (known as backward integration) or if it acquires a customer firm (forward integration). These business combinations [[Will|will]] involve companies all involved at different levels of the same vertical or [[Supply|supply]] chain.

### Is [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] good for a company?

This type of integration lowers the cost of doing business along a company's [[Supply|supply]] chain and internalizes management of operations from start to finish. Sometimes, however, it is actually more cost-effective to outsource or contract out stages in the production process to nimbler firms or ones with particular skill or expertise in some facet of production. As a result, one must carefully evaluate whether or not [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] makes sense on a case by case basis.

### How is [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] different form horizontal integation?

While [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] involves acquisitions up or down the [[Supply|supply]] chain, [[Horizontal Integration|horizontal integration]] instead refers to the acquisition of a competitor or a related business. Horizontal integrations help companies expand in size, diversify product offerings, reduce competition, and expand into new markets, while vertical integrations can help boost profit and allow companies more immediate access to consumers.
