[[Net Income (NI)]]
## What Is [[Net Income (NI)]]?

[[Net Income (NI)|Net income (NI)]], also called net earnings, is calculated as sales minus [[cost of goods sold]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp), selling, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, depreciation, interest, taxes, and other expenses. It is a useful number for investors to assess how much revenue exceeds the expenses of an organization. This number appears on a company's income statement and is also an indicator of a company's profitability.

### Key Takeaways

[[Net Income (NI)|Net income (NI)]] is calculated as revenues minus expenses, interest, and taxes.

-   Earnings per share are calculated using NI.
-   Investors should review the numbers used to calculate NI because expenses can be hidden in accounting methods, or revenues can be inflated.
-   NI also represents an individual's total earnings or pre-tax earnings after factoring deductions and taxes in [[Gross Income|gross income]].

Net income also refers to an individual's income after taking taxes and deductions into account.

## Understanding [[Net Income (NI)]]

Businesses use net income to calculate their earnings per share. Business analysts often refer to net income as the bottom line since it is at the bottom of the income statement. Analysts in the United Kingdom know NI as profit attributable to shareholders.

[[Net Income (NI)|Net income (NI)]] is known as the "bottom line" as it appears as the last line on the income statement once all expenses, interest, and taxes have been subtracted from revenues.

### Calculating NI for Businesses

To calculate net income for a business, start with a company's total revenue. From this figure, subtract the business's expenses and operating costs to calculate the business's earnings before tax. Deduct tax from this amount to find the NI.

NI, like other accounting measures, is susceptible to manipulation through such things as aggressive revenue recognition or hiding expenses. When basing an investment decision on NI, investors should review the quality of the numbers used to arrive at the [[Taxable Income|taxable income]] and NI.

### Personal [[Gross Income]] vs. NI

[[Gross Income|Gross income]] refers to an individual's total earnings or pre-tax earnings, and NI refers to the difference after factoring deductions and taxes into gross income. To calculate [[Taxable Income|taxable income]], which is the figure used by the [[Internal Revenue Service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) to determine income tax, taxpayers subtract deductions from gross income. The difference between taxable income and income tax is an individual's NI.

For example, an individual has $60,000 in [[Gross Income|gross income]] and qualifies for $10,000 in deductions. That individual's [[Taxable Income|taxable income]] is $50,000 with an [[Effective Tax Rate|effective tax rate]] of 13.88% giving an income tax payment $6,939.50 and NI of $43,060.50.

### NI on Tax Returns

In the United States, individual taxpayers submit a version of Form 1040 to the IRS to report annual earnings. This form does not have a line for net income. Instead, it has lines to record [[Gross Income|gross income]], [[adjusted gross income (AGI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp), and [[Taxable Income|taxable income]].1

After noting their [[Gross Income|gross income]], taxpayers subtract certain income sources such as [[Social Security]] benefits and qualifying deductions such as student [[Loan|loan]] interest. The difference is their AGI. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, net income and AGI are [[two different things]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070715/what-difference-between-agi-adjusted-gross-income-and-net-income.asp).Taxpayers then subtract standard or [[itemized deductions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/itemizeddeduction.asp) from their AGI to determine their [[Taxable Income|taxable income]]. As stated above, the difference between taxable income and income tax is the individual's NI, but this number is not noted on individual tax forms.

### NI on Paycheck Stubs

Most paycheck stubs have a line devoted to NI. This is the amount that appears on an employee's check. The number is the employee's [[Gross Income|gross income]], minus taxes, and retirement account contributions.
