[[Long-Term Growth (LTG)]]
## What Does [[Long-Term Growth (LTG)]] Mean?

[[Long-Term Growth (LTG)|Long-term growth (LTG)]] is an investment strategy that aims to increase the value of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] over a multi-year time frame. Although long-term is relative to an investorsâ€™ [[time horizons]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timehorizon.asp) and individual style, generally long-term growth is meant to create above market returns over a period of ten years or more. Because of the longer time frame, long-term growth portfolios can be more aggressive in holding a larger percentage of [[Stocks|stocks]] versus fixed-income products like bonds. Whereas an intermediate term [[balanced fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancedfund.asp) might have 60% stocks to 40%, a long-term [[Growth Fund|growth fund]] might have 80% stocks and 20% bonds.

## Understanding [[Long-Term Growth (LTG)]]

Long-term growth is meant to do exactly what it says - deliver [[Portfolio|portfolio]] growth over time. The catch is that the growth can be uneven. A long-term growth portfolio may under-perform the market in the first years and then [[Outperform|outperform]] later, or vice versa. This is a problem for investors in a long-term [[Growth Fund|growth fund]]. Even if a fund delivers good average growth over a decade, for example, the performance year to year [[Will|will]] vary. Therefore, investors can have very different outcomes depending on when they buy into the fund and how long they [[Hold|hold]]. Timing investments is, of course, a problem facing every market participant and not just long-term growth fund investors.

## [[Long-Term Growth (LTG)]] and Value Investing

The core advantage to long-term growth is that short-term price fluctuations are not of major concern. Similarly, many [[value investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp) focus on [[Stocks|stocks]] with long-term growth potential, searching for companies that are relatively inexpensive with strong [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]]. Then they simply wait until they increase in value as the market catches on to their fundamental strength before selling. Individual investors often benefit from a long-term growth focus, and that may lead them towards value investing as a strategy. However, long-term growth simply refers to the longer period over which returns are sought, not a particular investment style like value investing.

Long-term funds are just as likely to buy the market through various indexing products as they are to seek out undervalued [[Stocks|stocks]]. Value investing in particular can be difficult for fund managers to stick to for the long-term. Although investors in long-term growth funds are told to expect a decent average [[Return|return]] over multiple years, less patient investors are free to pull out unless the fund has [[lock-up period]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lockup-period.asp) - something that is usually found in [[Hedge|hedge]] or private funds. If a typical long-term [[Growth Fund|growth fund]] has too many mediocre years, then capital [[Will|will]] start to leave as investors seek better market returns. This can force a fund to prematurely trim [[Holdings|holdings]] before the market value catches up with the intrinsic value of the stocks.
