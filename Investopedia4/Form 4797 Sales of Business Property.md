## Who Can File Form 4797: Sales of Business Property?

Business property that is reported on Form 4797 may include property that is purchased in order to produce rental income. Taxpayers may also report a home that was used as a business on Form 4797. Gains made from the sale of oil, gas, geothermal, or mineral properties are also reported on Form 4797.

If a piece of property was used partially for business purposes, or to produce income—while also serving as a primary residence—gains from the sale of that property may be eligible for [[tax exclusion]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax_exempt.asp). This is typically the case for self-employed persons and [[independent contractors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/independent-contractor.asp) who generate their income from home.

The net profit or loss from the transfer or sale of the business property is determined by subtracting the [[cost basis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp), or purchase price, from the sum of the sales price minus any depreciation costs.

## How to File Form 4797: Sales of Business Property

Form 4797 has four parts. In general, most depreciable property held for more than a year is recognized under Part I: Sales or Exchanges of Property Used in a Trade or Business and Involuntary Conversions From Other Than Casualty or Theft.

Property held for a year or less and sold for a loss is recorded in Part II: Ordinary Gains and Losses. Capital assets held for more than a year and sold for a profit fall in the section labeled Part III: Gain From Disposition of Property Under [[Sections 1245]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section1245.asp), [1250](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section1250.asp), 1252, 1254, and 1255.

For a corporation or partnership, the total amount entered on Line 17, Part II, must be added to the gross income line on Schedule C. Part IV is labeled Recapture Amounts Under [[Sections 179]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-179.asp) and 280F(b)(2): When Business Use Drops to 50% or Less.

When a business, such as a [[flow-through entity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flow-through.asp)—like a partnership or an [[S Corporation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subchapters.asp)—sells a property, partners and shareholders may experience a tax event (either a gain or a loss) when the property is sold and a Form 4797 is filed.

The disposition of capital assets not reported on [[Schedule D]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scheduled.asp) must be reported on Form 4797, which can be [[downloaded]](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4797.pdf).
