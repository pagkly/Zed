[[Life Income Fund (LIF)]]
## What Does Life Income Fund Mean?

A [[Life Income Fund (LIF)|life income fund (LIF)]] is a type of registered retirement income fund (RRIF) offered in Canada that can be used to [[Hold|hold]] locked-in [pension funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp) as well as other assets for eventual [[payout]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Payout|payout]].asp) as retirement income. A life income fund cannot be withdrawn in a lump sum. Owners must use the fund in a manner that supports retirement income for their lifetime. Each year's Income Tax Act specifies the minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts for RRIFs, which encompasses LIFs. The Income Tax Act’s RRIF stipulations take into consideration fund balances and an annuity factor.

-   Life income funds are offered by many institutions in Canada to support various types of retirement distributions for investors.

## Understanding Life Income Fund

Life income funds are offered by Canadian financial institutions. They provide individuals with an investment vehicle for managing the payouts from [[locked-in]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/locked-in-retirement-account.asp) pension funds and other assets. In many cases, pension assets may be held but not accessible if an employee leaves a firm. These assets, usually called locked-in assets, can be managed in other investment vehicles but may require conversion to a life income fund when the owner is ready to begin taking withdrawals.

Life income fund payouts are determined by a government formula which applies to all types of [[RRIFs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rrif.asp). Most provinces in Canada require that life income fund assets be invested in a [[Life Annuity|life annuity]]. In many provinces, LIF withdrawals can begin at any age as long as the income is used for retirement income. Once an investor begins taking LIF payouts they must monitor the minimum and maximum amounts that can be withdrawn. These amounts are disclosed in the annual Income Tax Act, which provides stipulations pertaining to all RRIFs. The maximum RRIF/LIF withdrawal is the larger of two formulas, both defined as a percentage of the total investments.

The [financial institution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp) from which the LIF is issued must provide an annual statement to the LIF owner. Based on the annual statement, the LIF owner must specify at the beginning of each [fiscal year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp) the amount of income they would like to withdraw. This must be within a defined range to ensure the account holds enough funds to provide lifetime income for the LIF owner.
