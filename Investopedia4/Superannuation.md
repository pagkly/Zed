[[Superannuation]]
## What Is a [[Superannuation]]?

A [[Superannuation|superannuation]] is an organizational pension program created by a company for the benefit of its employees. It is also referred to as a company [[pension plan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp). Funds deposited in a superannuation account [[Will|will]] grow, typically without any tax implications, until retirement or withdrawal. In the U.S., superannuation plans are usually either [[defined-benefit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedbenefitpensionplan.asp) or [[defined-contribution plans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedcontributionplan.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Superannuation|superannuation]] is more commonly referred to as a company [[Pension Plan|pension plan]].
-   Superannuations are usually defined-benefit or defined-contribution plans.
-   A retiree with a [[Superannuation|superannuation]] is typically less concerned about outliving their retirement funds.

## Understanding [[Superannuation]]

As funds are added by employer (and potentially employee) contribution and other traditional growth vehicles, the funds are reserved in a [[Superannuation|superannuation]] fund. This form of monetary fund [[Will|will]] be used to pay out employee pension benefits as participating employees become eligible. An employee is deemed to be superannuated upon reaching the proper age or as a result of an infirmity. At that point, the employee will be able to draw benefits from the fund.

A [[Superannuation|superannuation]] fund differs from some other retirement investment mechanisms in that the benefit available to an eligible employee is defined by a set schedule and not by the performance of the investment.

## [[Superannuation]] From the Employer and Employee Perspective

As a [[Defined-Benefit Plan|defined-benefit plan]], a [[Superannuation|superannuation]] supplies a fixed, predetermined benefit depending on a variety of factors, but it is not dependent on market performance. Certain factors may include the number of years the person was employed with the company, the employee's salary, and the exact age at which the employee begin to draw the benefit. Employees often value these benefits for their predictability. From a business perspective, they can be more complex to administer, but they also allow for larger contributions than some other [[employer-sponsored plans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer_sponsored_plan.asp).

Upon qualifying for retirement, the eligible employee receives a fixed amount, usually on a monthly basis. As mentioned, the amount is determined by a preexisting formula. The function of a [[Superannuation|superannuation]], in that regard, is similar to receiving [[Social Security]] benefits upon reaching the qualifying age or under qualifying circumstances. Depending on what other retirement savings vehicles the employee has, there may be other implications that require consideration in order to access the funds in the most tax-efficient way possible.

## The Key Difference Between a [[Superannuation]] and Other Plans

While a [[Superannuation|superannuation]] guarantees a specific benefit once the employee qualifies, other traditional retirement vehicles may not. For example, a superannuation is not affected by individual investment choices, but retirement plans such as the [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) or [[IRA]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp) [[Will|will]] be affected by positive and negative market fluctuations. In that sense, the exact benefit from an investment-based retirement plan may not be as predictable as those offered in a superannuation.

A person on a [[Defined-Benefit Plan|defined-benefit plan]] generally [[Will|will]] not have to be concerned with the total amount remaining in the account and is usually at low [[Risk|risk]] of running out of funds before death. In other investment vehicles, poor performance could lead a person to run out of available funds before death.
