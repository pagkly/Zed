## What Is a Collateralized [[Debt]] Obligation (CDO)?

A collateralized [[Debt|debt]] obligation (CDO) is a complex [[Structured Finance|structured finance]] product that is backed by a pool of loans and other assets and sold to institutional investors. A CDO is a particular type of [[derivative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) because, as its name implies, its value is _derived_ from another [[Underlying|underlying]] asset. These assets become the [[Collateral|collateral]] if the [[Loan|loan]] defaults.

#### A Primer On Collateralized [[Debt]] Obligation (CDOs)

## Understanding Collateralized [[Debt]] Obligations

To create a CDO, investment banks gather [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]-generating assets—such as mortgages, bonds, and other types of [[Debt|debt]]—and repackage them into discrete classes, or [[Tranches|tranches]] based on the level of credit [[Risk|risk]] assumed by the investor.

### Types of CDOs

These [[Tranches|tranches]] of securities become the final investment products: bonds, whose names can reflect their specific [[Underlying|underlying]] assets. For example, [[mortgage-backed securities (MBS)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp) are comprised of mortgage loans, and asset-backed securities (ABS) contain corporate [[Debt|debt]], auto loans, or credit card debt. CDOs are called "collateralized" because the promised repayments of the underlying assets are the [[Collateral|collateral]] that gives the CDOs their value.

Other types of CDOs include collateralized bond obligations (CBOs)—investment-grade bonds that are backed by a pool of high-[[Yield|yield]] but lower-rated bonds, and collateralized [[Loan|loan]] obligations (CLOs)—single securities that are backed by a pool of [[Debt|debt]], that often contain corporate loans with a low credit [[Rating|rating]]. 

### How Are CDOs Structured?

The [[Tranches|tranches]] of CDOs are named to reflect their [[Risk|risk]] profiles; for example, senior [[Debt|debt]], [[Mezzanine Debt|mezzanine debt]], and junior debt—pictured in the sample below along with their [[Standard and Poor's (S&P) credit ratings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp). But the actual structure varies depending on the individual product.

In the table, note that the higher the credit [[Rating|rating]], the lower the [[coupon rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp) (rate of interest the bond pays annually). If the [[Loan|loan]] defaults, the senior bondholders get paid first from the collateralized pool of assets, followed by bondholders in the other [[Tranches|tranches]] according to their credit ratings; the lowest-rated credit is paid last.

The senior [[Tranches|tranches]] are generally safest because they have the first claim on the [[Collateral|collateral]]. Although the senior [[Debt|debt]] is usually rated higher than the junior tranches, it offers lower coupon rates. Conversely, the junior debt offers higher coupons (more interest) to compensate for their greater [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]]; but because they are riskier, they generally come with lower credit ratings.

Senior [[Debt]] = Higher credit [[Rating|rating]], but lower interest rates. Junior Debt = Lower credit rating, but higher interest rates.

### More About Creating CDOs

Collateralized [[Debt|debt]] obligations are complicated, and numerous professionals have a hand in creating them:

-   Securities firms, who approve the selection of [[Collateral|collateral]], structure the notes into [[Tranches|tranches]] and sell them to investors
-   CDO managers, who select the [[Collateral|collateral]] and often manage the CDO portfolios
-   [[Rating]] agencies, who assess the CDOs and assign them credit ratings
-   Financial guarantors, who promise to reimburse investors for any losses on the CDO [[Tranches|tranches]] in exchange for [[Premium|premium]] payments
-   Investors such as pension funds and [[Hedge|hedge]] funds

### Key Takeaways

-   A collateralized [[Debt|debt]] obligation is a complex structured-[[Finance|finance]] product that is backed by a pool of loans and other assets.
-   These [[Underlying|underlying]] assets serve as [[Collateral|collateral]] if the [[Loan|loan]] goes into [[Default|default]].
-   Though risky and not for all investors, CDOs are a viable tool for shifting [[Risk|risk]] and freeing up capital.

## A Brief History of CDOs

The earliest CDOs were constructed in 1987 by the former investment bank, Drexel Burnham Lambert—where [[Michael Milken]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/michaelmilken.asp), then called the "junk bond king," reigned.1 The Drexel bankers created these early CDOs by assembling portfolios of junk bonds, issued by different companies. Ultimately, other securities firms launched CDOs containing other assets that had more predictable income streams, such as automobile loans, student loans, credit card receivables, and aircraft leases. However, CDOs remained a niche product until 2003–04, when the U.S. housing boom led CDO issuers to turn their attention to subprime mortgage-backed securities as a new source of [[Collateral|collateral]] for CDOs.2

## CDOs and the Global [[Financial Crisis]]

Collateralized [[Debt|debt]] obligations exploded in popularity, with CDO sales rising almost tenfold from $30 billion in 2003 to $225 billion in 2006.3 But their subsequent implosion, triggered by the U.S. housing [[Correction|correction]], saw CDOs become one of the worst-performing instruments in the subprime meltdown, which began in 2007 and peaked in 2009. The bursting of the CDO bubble inflicted losses running into hundreds of billions of dollars for some of the largest financial services institutions. These losses resulted in the investment banks either going bankrupt or being bailed out via government intervention and helped to escalate the global [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]], the Great Recession, during this period.

Despite their role in the [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]], collateralized [[Debt|debt]] obligations are still an active area of structured-[[Finance|finance]] investing. CDOs and the even more infamous [[Synthetic|synthetic]] CDOs are still in use, as ultimately they are a tool for shifting [[Risk|risk]] and freeing up capital—two of the very outcomes that investors depend on Wall Street to accomplish, and for which Wall Street has always had an appetite.
