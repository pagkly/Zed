Chattel Mortgages: An Ownership Interest Rather Than a [[Lien]]
## What Is a Chattel Mortgage?

A chattel mortgage is a [[Loan|loan]] arrangement in which an item of the movable [[Personal Property|personal property]] acts as [[Security|security]] for a [[loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp). The movable property, or chattel, guarantees the loan, and the [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) holds an interest in it. A chattel mortgage differs from a conventional mortgage in which the loan is secured by a [lien](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp) on the real stationary property.

Chattel home loans are referred to as [[Security|security]] agreements in some areas of the country. The terms "[[Personal Property|personal property]] security," "[[Lien|lien]] on personal property," or even "[movable hypothec](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hypothecation.asp)" are also synonyms for a chattel mortgage used in different jurisdictions around the world.

### Key Takeaways

-   The movable property, or chattel, guarantees the [[Loan|loan]]. The [[Lender|lender]] holds an ownership interest on it.
-   Mobile homes where the owner buys the trailer but not the land are often financed with chattel mortgages.
-   Heavy business equipment may be purchased by a company's owner using a chattel mortgage.
-   Chattel loans are often more expensive than traditional mortgage loans.

## Understanding Chattel Mortgages

Vehicles, airplanes, boats, farm equipment, and [[manufactured homes]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/112814/fha-loans-option-manufactured-homes-too.asp) are good examples of assets often financed using chattel mortgages.

These mortgages on [[Personal Property|personal property]] have specific rules. For example, chattel home loans must be registered in a public registry so that third parties can be aware of them before entering into financing agreements with potential borrowers who want to put the property up as [[Security|security]] for another [[Loan|loan]]. Security agreements associated with aircraft are also typically recorded with the Aircraft Registration Branch of the Federal Aviation Administration.

## Chattel Mortgage vs. Traditional Mortgage

A chattel mortgage differs from a traditional mortgage in that the [[Lender|lender]] can take possession of the property that serves as [[Security|security]] when a conventional [[Loan|loan]] is in [[Default|default]]. The legal relationship is reversed with a chattel mortgage.

The [[Lender|lender]] does not [[Hold|hold]] a [[Lien|lien]] against the movable property—the chattel. Instead, ownership of the chattel conditionally transfers to him until the [[Loan|loan]] has been satisfied. The borrower resumes full control and ownership of the chattel at that point.

## Types of Chattel Mortgages

### Mobile Homes

Chattel mortgages are frequently used to [[finance mobile homes]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/033115/are-mortgages-available-mobile-homes.asp) that are situated on leased land. A traditional mortgage can't be used because the land doesn't belong to the mobile homeowner. Instead, the mobile home is considered "personal movable property," and it can be the subject of a chattel mortgage, serving as [[Security|security]] for the [[Loan|loan]].

The financing arrangement remains valid even if the mobile home is moved to a different location.

### Equipment Loans

Businesses frequently use chattel mortgages to [[purchase new equipment]](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/helpful_hints.pdf). Heavy machinery has a long lifespan, and its purchase can be financed over some time by the seller. Still, the seller [[Will|will]] want to keep a [[Security|security]] interest in the machinery in the event of [[Default|default]].

A chattel mortgage allows the buyer to use the equipment while maintaining a safe position for the seller at the same time. The seller can recover the equipment and sell it to recover losses from the [[Loan|loan]] balance if the buyer defaults.
