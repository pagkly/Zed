[[Loss Payee]]
## What Is a [[Loss Payee]]?

The [[Loss Payee|loss payee]] is the party to whom the claim from a loss is to be paid. A loss [[Payee|payee]] can mean several different things; in the [[insurance industry]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/080616/what-adverse-selection-insurance-industry.asp), the insured, or the party entitled to payment is the loss payee. The insured can expect [[Reimbursement|reimbursement]] from the insurance carrier in the event of a loss. One example would be if a borrower defaulted on their [[Loan|loan]] and didn't pay it.

## How [[Loss Payee]] Works

[[Loss Payee|Loss payee]] can be different from "first loss [[Payee|payee]]," which is the party that must be paid first when a [[debtor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debtor|debtor]].asp) defaults on a [[Loan|loan]]. 'Loss payee' is simply a generic phrase signifying the rightful recipient of any kind of [[reimbursement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Reimbursement|reimbursement]].asp) and is most often used in the auto insurance industry.

### Key Takeaways

-   When you use [[Collateral|collateral]] to secure your [[Loan|loan]], a [[Loss Payee|loss payee]] [[Will|will]] be put onto your insurance policy. 
-   The [[Loss Payee|loss payee]] acts as a guard for the [[Lender|lender]] to protect it against unpaid loans. 
-   When there is a total loss, the [[Lender|lender]] is paid before anyone else. 

When financing a vehicle purchase, a buyer must agree to carry [[insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-auto-insurance.asp) on the secured property, otherwise forced placed insurance becomes a possibility. The financial institution making the [[Loan|loan]] typically insists that they are indicated as the [[Loss Payee|loss payee]] on the insurance policy to protect themselves against loss.

For example, the [[Loss Payee|loss payee]] section is a section on an [[auto insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auto-insurance.asp) policy that lists your [[Lender|lender]]’s name and address on the given [[Collateral|collateral]]. It is important to give the correct address for your lender, as some insurance companies have multiple addresses.

The term [[Loss Payee|loss payee]] is most often used in the auto insurance industry but is also used by other insurance sectors.

The [[Lender|lender]] [[Will|will]] usually require verification of insurance coverage, and the [[Loss Payee|loss payee]] should be added as soon as you buy insurance for the covered vehicle. This verification of insurance cannot be satisfied simply by an insurance id card; it needs to be a declarations page. The declarations page will have multiple pieces of crucial information [[Listed|listed]] for your lender:

-   Policy effective dates
-   VIN of the vehicle insured
-   Vehicle coverage
-   [[Loss Payee|Loss payee]] [[Listed|listed]] properly

## Explaining [[Loss Payee]] Status

When [[Listed|listed]] as a [[Loss Payee|loss payee]], the [[Lender|lender]] [[Will|will]] receive notification of your insurance policy’s status on a regular basis. The notifications will inform the lender of all activities on your insurance policy. For example, the loss [[Payee|payee]] section of an auto insurance policy creates more than a direct link between your insurance company and your lender.

Since you are not the sole owner of the [[Collateral|collateral]], claim checks [[Will|will]] be payable to both you and the [[Lender|lender]]...or directly to a repair shop. In a [total loss](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actual-total-loss.asp), the lender will be paid first.

For the [[Lender|lender]], being [[Listed|listed]] as a [[Loss Payee|loss payee]] ensures the lender [[Will|will]] be compensated for their [[Collateral|collateral]], regardless of potential losses.

The [[Loss Payee|loss payee]] is essentially a safety net for the [[Lender|lender]] to reduce unpaid loans. If you do not list your lender as loss [[Payee|payee]], it is probable the lender [[Will|will]] put forced placed insurance on your [[Collateral|collateral]].
