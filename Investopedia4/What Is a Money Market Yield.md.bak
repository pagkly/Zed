[[What Is a Money Market Yield]]?
The [[Money Market|money market]] [[Yield|yield]] is the interest rate earned by investing in securities with high [[Liquidity|liquidity]] and maturities of less than one year such as [[negotiable certificates of deposit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ncd.asp), U.S. Treasury bills and municipal notes. Money market yield is calculated by taking the holding period yield and multiplying it by a 360-day bank year divided by days to maturity. It can also be calculated using a [[bank discount yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-discount-rate.asp).

The [[Money Market|money market]] [[Yield|yield]] is also known as the CD-equivalent yield or bond equivalent yield.

## Breaking Down [[Money Market]] [[Yield]]

The [[Money Market|money market]] is the part of the broader financial markets that deals with highly liquid and short term financial securities. The market links borrowers and lenders who are looking to transact in short-term instruments overnight or for some days, weeks, or months, but always less than a year. Active participants in this market include banks, [[money market funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp), brokers, and dealers. Examples of money market securities include [[Certificates of Deposit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) (CD), [[Treasury bills]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp) (T-bills), commercial paper, municipal notes, short-term asset-backed securities, Eurodollar deposits, and [[repurchase agreements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repurchaseagreement.asp).

[[Money Market|Money market]] investors receive compensation for lending funds to entities that need to fulfill their short-term [[Debt|debt]] obligations. This compensation is typically in the form of variable interest rates determined by the current interest rate in the economy. Since money market securities are considered to have low [[default risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp), the money market [[Yield|yield]] [[Will|will]] be lower than the yield on [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds but higher than the interest rates on standard savings accounts.

Although interest rates are quoted annually, the quoted interest may actually be compounded semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or even daily. The [[Money Market|money market]] [[Yield|yield]] is calculated using the [[bond equivalent yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bey.asp) (BEY) based on a 360-day year, which helps an investor compare the [[Return|return]] of a bond that pays a coupon on an annual basis with a bond that pays semi-annual, quarterly, or any other coupons. The formula for the money market yield is:

[[Money Market|Money market]] [[Yield|yield]] = [[Holding period yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiodreturn-yield.asp) x (360/Time to maturity)

[[Money Market|Money market]] [[Yield|yield]] = \[(Face value – [[Purchase Price|Purchase price]])/Purchase price\] x (360/Time to maturity)

For example, a T-bill with $100,000 [[face value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp) is issued for $98,000 and due to mature in 180 days. The [[Money Market|money market]] [[Yield|yield]] is:

\= ($100,000 - $98,000/$98,000) x 360/180

\= 0.0204 x 2

\= 0.0408, or 4.08%

The [[Money Market|money market]] [[Yield|yield]] differs slightly from the bank discount yield, which is computed on the face value, not the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]]. However, the money market yield can also be calculated using the bank discount yield as seen in this formula:

[[Money Market|Money market]] [[Yield|yield]] = Bank discount yield x (Face value/[[Purchase Price|Purchase price]])

[[Money Market|Money market]] [[Yield|yield]] = Bank discount yield / \[1 – (Face value – [[Purchase Price|Purchase price]]/Face value)\]

Where bank discount [[Yield|yield]] = (Face value – [[Purchase Price|Purchase price]])/Face value x (360/Time to maturity)

To earn a [[Money Market|money market]] [[Yield|yield]], it is necessary to have a [[money market account]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarketaccount.asp). Banks, for example, [[Offer|offer]] money market accounts because they need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet [[reserve requirements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp) and to participate in interbank lending.
