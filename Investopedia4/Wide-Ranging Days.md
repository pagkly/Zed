[[Wide-Ranging Days]]
## What Are [[Wide-Ranging Days]]?

[[Wide-Ranging Days|Wide-ranging days]] describe the price range of a [[Stock|stock]] on a particularly volatile day of trading. Wide-ranging days occur when the high and low prices of a stock are much further apart than they are on a typical day. Some [[technical analysts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analyst.asp) identify these days by using the [[volatility ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]]-ratio.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Wide-Ranging Days|Wide-ranging days]] occur when the high and low prices of a [[Stock|stock]] are much further apart than they are on a typical day. 
-   Extreme [[Wide-Ranging Days|wide-ranging days]] can help predict major trend reversals.
-   The average true range (ATR) provides a way to compare the trading range between multiple days. 
-   Meanwhile, the [[Volatility Ratio|volatility ratio]] can be used to identify [[Wide-Ranging Days|wide-ranging days]] using a technical indicator—automates the process of finding wide-ranging days.
-   [[Wide-Ranging Days|Wide-ranging days]] typically occur when the [[Volatility Ratio|volatility ratio]] exceeds a reading of 2.0 over a 14-day period.

## Understanding [[Wide-Ranging Days]]

[[Wide-Ranging Days|Wide-ranging days]] have a true range that is larger than the surrounding days, and wide-ranging days usually predict a trend [[reversal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Reversal|reversal]].asp). Extreme wide-ranging days signal major trend reversals, while less extreme wide-ranging days signal minor reversals.

The [[average true range]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp) (ATR) provides a way to compare the trading range between multiple days by looking at the difference between the close of the previous day and either the high or low of the current period depending on what’s greater. 

The true range for a given period is the greater of the high for the period minus the low for the period, the high for the period minus the close for the previous period, or the close for the previous period minus the low for the current period.

The average true range is usually a 14-day [[exponential moving average]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) (EMA) of the true range, although different trades may use different periods. An exponential moving average is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. This is also referred to as the exponentially [[weighted]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Weighted|weighted]].asp) moving average.

After a sharp down-trend, a wide-ranging day with a strong close (close near the high of the day) is a signal that the trend [[Will|will]] reverse. Meanwhile, after a strong advance, a wide-ranging day with a weak close (close near the low of the day) signals a downside [[Reversal|reversal]].

## Special Considerations 

The [[Volatility Ratio|volatility ratio]] can be used to identify [[Wide-Ranging Days|wide-ranging days]] using a [[technical indicator]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp). In essence, this automates the process of finding wide-ranging days and makes it possible for traders to easily screen for opportunities rather than simply looking at charts.

The [[Volatility Ratio|volatility ratio]] is calculated by dividing the true range for a given day by the exponential moving average of the true range over a period, which is usually 14 days. In general, [[Wide-Ranging Days|wide-ranging days]] occur when the [[Volatility|volatility]] ratio exceeds a reading of 2.0 over a 14-day period. Traders may use volatility ratios in their [[Stock|stock]] charts when looking for potential [[Reversal|reversal]] opportunities.

[[Wide-Ranging Days|Wide-ranging days]] occur when the price range of a particular [[Stock|stock]] greatly exceeds the [[Volatility|volatility]] of a normal trading day. Oftentimes, these days are measured with the average true range, and analysis is automated using the [[Volatility Ratio|volatility ratio]]. Wide-ranging days usually predict trend reversals, although traders should confirm reversals using other technical indicators and chart patterns.
