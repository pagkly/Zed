Mom-and-Pop Establishments: Going Old School
## What Is a Mom-and-Pop Establishment?

"Mom-and-pop" is a colloquial term used to describe a small, [[family-owned]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/070116/top-25-richest-american-families.asp), or independent business. Mom-and-pop stores are often operations that struggle to compete with more substantial establishments, such as [[big-box retailers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/big_box_retailer.asp), who generally boast more buying power than smaller players. In the last few years, "shop local" and "shop small" have been used as slogans in marketing campaigns. The term "mom-and-pop" also refers to inexperienced investors who casually play the market.

### Key Takeaways

-   The popularity of mom-and-pop stores is on the rise, thanks in part to shoppers seeking unique services or products.
-   Traditional mom-and-pop businesses, like bookstores and pharmacies, have found it financially difficult to compete with large chain stores.
-   National Mom and Pop Business Owners Day is on March 29.
-   Mom-and-pop businesses benefit from local consumers who are determined to pump their money into their communities to promote local economic growth.

## Understanding Mom-and-Pop Entities

Mom-and-pop stores were historically used to describe local family owned and operated general stores or drugstores. Today, mom-and-pop establishments are synonymous with various different types of businesses, including restaurants, bookstores, automotive repair shops, and insurance agencies.

In many ways, mom-and-pop businesses stand at a steep disadvantage to large corporations, e-[[Commerce|commerce]] companies, technology platforms, and franchise businesses, who enjoy bigger [economies of scale](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp), greater access to capital for investments, larger advertising budgets, higher brand awareness, greater access to talent pools for hiring, etc.

This collectively gives larger players a competitive edge over mom-and-pop businesses, _who frequently, lose ground and find themselves forced out of business in response._

Fortunately, there are signs of hope for mom-and-pop stores. More than ever before, consumers are demanding more personalized products and services. When shoppers ask, "Where can I find a mom-and-pop shop near me?" they don't need to look further than the Internet. Using technology, like [[Social Media|social media]], small businesses can expand their target audience and broaden their geographical reach.

Mom-and-pop shops also benefit from a phenomenon known as "Small Business Saturday," which is a recent American tradition of shopping locally on the Saturday following Thanksgiving. This shopping holiday is a logical answer to Black Friday, where large retailers [[Offer|offer]] enticing discounts to consumers. Mom-and-pop business owners tend to have a [[Vested Interest|vested interest]] in the community, its citizens, and the local economy. Consequently, they offer highly interactive and personalized services that large corporations cannot replicate. For this reason, mom-and-pop stores often win increased [[brand loyalty]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-loyalty.asp) among consumers.

Mom-and-pop drugstores are typically owned and operated by the same family for generations, where the druggist or pharmacist would also be the proprietor of the store.

## Mom-and-Pop Investors vs. Mom-and-Pop Establishments

"Mom-and-pop" also refers to inexperienced investors who minimally invest in the [[Stock|stock]] market. Despite limited capital commitments, mom-and-pop investors often count on significant returns on their trades, in order to supplement their income.

But many mom-and-pop investors are unfamiliar with market research and react impulsively to market changes and fluctuations, by rashly [[Dumping|dumping]] their positions, rather than riding out rough patches.

Some mom-and-pop investors combat their inexperience by hiring brokers to facilitate trades, or by using one of the many online trading platforms to facilitate their investments.
