## Understanding the [[Vice Fund]]

The Vitium [[Global Fund]], formerly called the [[Vice Fund]], primarily invests in [[Stocks|stocks]] generating the majority of their [[revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp) from the alcohol, tobacco, gaming, and defense industries. This encompasses casino operators, gaming equipment manufacturers, defense equipment manufacturers, alcohol producers, and tobacco producers.

The Fund invests in both domestic and foreign-based equities, with its [[Holdings|holdings]] ranging from small-cap to mega-cap companies. It has been in operation since 2002. From July 2014 to October 2016, the Fund was known as the Barrier Fund.

The Fund seeks high-quality [[dividend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp)\-paying [[Stocks|stocks]] in the vice industries and believes these industries have significant [[barriers to entry]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrierstoentry.asp), which make successful companies a source of reliable [[Stock|stock]] returns.

The Fund also believes that its investments are generally market-[[Neutral|neutral]], meaning that they do well in both down and up markets because of a steady demand for vice industry goods through all [[Market Cycles|market cycles]].
