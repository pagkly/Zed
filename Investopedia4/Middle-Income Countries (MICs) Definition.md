[[Middle-Income Countries (MICs) Definition]]
## What Is a Middle-Income Country? (MIC)

According to the [[World Bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldbank.asp), [[middle-income countries]](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mic) (MICs) are defined as economies with a [[gross national income (GNI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-national-income-gni.asp) per capita between $1,036 and $12,535.1 MICs are one of the income categories that the World Bank uses to classify [[economies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp) for operational and analytical purposes.

### Key Takeaways

-   Middle-income countries are those with $1,026 to $12,475 in per capita GNI. 
-   The World Bank classifies countries for operational purposes for the financial and economic development services that it provides to them.
-   Middle-income countries make up a large share of the world's population and economic activity, and they are key to global economic growth.

## Understanding Middle-Income Countries (MICS)

The World Bank has historically classified every economy as low, middle, or high income. It now further specifies countries as having low-, lower-middle-, upper-middle-, or high-income economies. The World Bank uses GNI per capita, in current U.S. dollars converted by the Atlas method of a three-year moving average of exchange rates, as the basis for this classification. It views GNI as a broad measure and the single best indicator of economic capacity and progress. The World Bank used to refer to low-income and middle-income economies as developing economies; in 2016, it chose to drop the term from its vocabulary, citing a lack of specificity. Instead, the World Bank now refers to countries by their region, income, and lending status. 

## Middle-Income Country (MIC) Characteristics

MICs are broken up into lower-middle income and upper-middle income economies. Lower-middle-income economies have per capita GNIs between $1,036 and $4,045, while upper-middle economies have per capita GNIs between $3,046 and $12,535.1 MICs are a very diverse group by region, size, population, and income level, ranging from tiny nations with small populations, such as Belize and the Marshall Islands, to all four of the [[BRIC]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bric.asp) giants—Brazil, Russia, India, and China. China and India together account for nearly one-third of the world's population and are increasingly influential players in the global economy.

There are 53 lower-middle income economies and 56 upper-middle economies. The diverse nature of these 109 MICs means that the challenges facing many of them are quite different. For nations in the lower-middle-income category, the biggest issue might be providing its citizens with essential services, such as water and electricity. For the economies in the upper-middle-income category, the greatest challenges could be curbing corruption and improving governance.

## The Significance of Middle Income Countries (MICs)

MICs are essential for continued global [[economic growth]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp) and stability. According to the World Bank, sustainable growth and development in MICs have positive spillovers to the rest of the world. Examples are [[Poverty|poverty]] reduction, international financial stability, and global cross-border issues, including climate change, sustainable energy development, food and water [[Security|security]], and international trade.

MICs have a combined population of five billion, or over 70% of the world's seven billion people, hosting 73% of the world's economically disadvantaged. Representing about one-third of global GDP, MICs are a major engine of global economic growth.

## Graduating from Lower- to Upper-Middle Income

Countries graduate from one level to another depending on their GNI per capita. According to a [[July 2019 report]](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-country-classifications-income-level-2019-2020) by the World Bank, India continued to be a lower-middle-income country along with 46 others in the South Asia region, while Sri Lanka moved to the upper-middle-income group in 2020. Sri Lanka had been a lower-middle-income group since 1999, while India has been a lower-middle-income country since 2009. Another example is Chile, which moved up to a high-income country status in 2013.2
