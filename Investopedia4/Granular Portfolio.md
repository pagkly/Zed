[[Granular Portfolio]]
## What Is a [[Granular Portfolio]]?

A [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] is an investment [portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp) that is well diversified across a wide variety of assets, typically with a significant number of [[Holdings|holdings]]. Because this type of portfolio contains a large number of positions in different asset classes and/or sectors, it is considered to have a lower overall [[Risk|risk]] profile. Conversely, portfolios that have "low granularity" have fewer positions or contain highly correlated assets. They are less [[diversified]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Diversification|diversification]].asp) and have a higher overall risk profile.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] has investments across many asset classes and sectors.
-   The primary advantage of a [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] to an investor is the ability to reduce [[Risk|risk]] through [[Diversification|diversification]].
-   Other advantages include the ability to customize a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of [[Holdings|holdings]] to meet an investor's financial objectives and the flexibility to diversify across many asset classes.
-   Disadvantages of a [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] include the potential of losing out on windfall gains and the possible exposure to increased [[Risk|risk]] during market [[Volatility|volatility]].

## How a [[Granular Portfolio]] Works

A [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] can refer to a credit, currency, [[Equity|equity]], bond, or mixed asset class [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. Highly granular portfolios, sometimes referred to as infinitely granular, diversify most of the [[Unsystematic Risk|unsystematic risk]] (individual [[Security|security]] [[Risk|risk]]) out of the portfolio so that it is exposed to [systemic risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systemic-risk.asp) only, which investors can't minimize through [[Diversification|diversification]].

## Advantages of a [[Granular Portfolio]]

While the primary advantage to an investor is the reduction of [[Risk|risk]], other advantages of a [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] include the ability to customize a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] and to diversify across many asset classes.

### Reduces [[Risk]]

Having investments across many sectors and asset classes helps to reduce a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s overall [[Risk|risk]]. For example, if healthcare [[Stocks|stocks]] are underperforming, a [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] with exposure to other sectors—such as technology, financials, and [[consumer goods]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-goods-sector.asp)—helps to offset those positions. Bonds can be added to a granular portfolio to provide income when stocks go through range-bound periods.                                                                                                    

### Customization

Because granular portfolios include many [[Holdings|holdings]], they can easily be adjusted to meet the financial objectives of many different investors. For instance, an investor might have their asset allocations split between equities, [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), and cash. When the investor is young, 90% of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] may be invested in equities, with 5% in bonds and 5% in cash. As the investor approaches retirement, they can easily adjust the portfolio to have more conservative allocations.

### Asset Choice

A [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] gives investors the flexibility to diversify across multiple asset classes as they see fit. For example, if precious metal commodities, such as gold and silver, are trending higher, an investor could add some [[Futures|futures]] contracts to his [[Portfolio|portfolio]] to [[Gain|gain]] exposure to the move.

## Disadvantages of a [[Granular Portfolio]]

Although there are fewer disadvantages to a [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]], they can be significant, particularly during times of marketplace instability or downturns.

### Windfall Gains

The diversified structure of a [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] means that a large [[Gain|gain]] in a single investment has a minimal impact on overall returns. For instance, a [[stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp) in an investor’s [[Portfolio|portfolio]] may increase by 75%, but that holding only accounts for a slight gain if it represents 5% of the portfolio's value.

### Exposure

In a stable economic environment, a [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] takes advantage of uncorrelated asset classes and sectors offsetting each other to help reduce [[Risk|risk]]. These correlations may break down in a [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] to actually increase risk.

For example, during the global [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] between 2008 and 2009, price moves in equities and commodities became strongly correlated, while bonds and equities became uncorrelated. Investors who [[Hold|hold]] a [[Granular Portfolio|granular portfolio]] should continually monitor changing correlations between asset classes to ensure they don’t overexpose themselves. Understanding this relationship between [[market correlation and volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/022516/4-reasons-why-market-[[Correlation|correlation]]-matters.asp) can help investors manage [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Risk|risk]].
