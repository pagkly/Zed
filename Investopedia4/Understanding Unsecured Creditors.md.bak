[[Understanding Unsecured Creditors]]
## What Is an [[Unsecured]] [[Creditor]]?

An [[Unsecured|unsecured]] [[Creditor|creditor]] is an individual or institution that lends money without obtaining specified [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/what-is-an-asset.asp) as [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp). This poses a higher [[Risk|risk]] to the [[creditor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp) because it [[Will|will]] have nothing to fall back on should the borrower [[Default|default]] on the [[Loan|loan]]. If a borrower fails to make a payment on a [[Debt|debt]] that is unsecured, the creditor cannot take any of the borrower's assets without winning a lawsuit first.

A debenture holder is an [[Unsecured|unsecured]] [[Creditor|creditor]].

[[Unsecured]] credit is viewed as a higher [[Risk|risk]].

## How an [[Unsecured]] [[Creditor]] Works

It's uncommon for individuals to be able to [[borrow money without collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/[[Collateral|collateral]]/). For example, when you take out a mortgage, a bank [[Will|will]] always [[Hold|hold]] your house as collateral for the [[Loan|loan]] in case you [[Default|default]]. If you take out a loan on an automobile, the [[Lender|lender]] will secure their [[Debt|debt]] with your car until it's fully paid off.

One exception wherein money is borrowed without [[Collateral|collateral]] is large corporations, which often issue [[Unsecured|unsecured]] commercial paper.

## Differences Between Secured and [[Unsecured]] Creditors

[Secured creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secured-[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) may repossess assets as payment for a [[Debt|debt]] using the borrower's [[Collateral|collateral]]. Since the borrower has more to lose by defaulting on a secured [[Loan|loan]], and the [[Lender|lender]] has an asset to [[Gain|gain]], this type of debt carries less [[Risk|risk]] for the lender. As a result, secured debt generally comes with lower interest rates when compared to [[unsecured debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecureddebt.asp).

Meanwhile, repayment to [[Unsecured|unsecured]] creditors is generally dependent on bankruptcy proceedings or successful litigation. An unsecured [[Creditor|creditor]] must first file a legal complaint in court and obtain a judgment before proceeding with collection through wage [[Garnishment|garnishment]] and other types of liquidated borrower-owned assets.

Often, a [[Creditor|creditor]] [[Will|will]] first attempt to obtain payment through direct contact and report the outstanding [[Debt|debt]] to the [[major credit bureaus]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditbureau.asp)—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—before seeking to bring the matter to court. The creditor may also choose to sell the unpaid debt to a [[Collection Agency|collection agency]].

### Key Takeaways

-   Secured creditors often require [[Collateral|collateral]] in the event the borrower defaults.
-   Usually, bankruptcy is the only option for [[Unsecured|unsecured]] creditors if the borrower defaults.
-   [[Unsecured]] creditors can range from credit card companies to doctor's offices.

## Types of [[Unsecured]] Creditors

Due to the high [[Risk|risk]] to the [[Lender|lender]], [[Unsecured|unsecured]] [[Debt|debt]] often comes with higher interest rates, placing a higher financial burden on the borrower.

Some of the most common types of [[Unsecured|unsecured]] creditors include credit card companies, utilities, landlords, hospitals and doctor's offices, and lenders that issue personal or student loans (though education loans carry a special exception that prevents them from being discharged).

Defaulting on [[Unsecured|unsecured]] [[Debt|debt]] can negatively affect the borrower's [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]], making it much less likely that an unsecured [[Creditor|creditor]] [[Will|will]] extend them credit in the future.
