[[What Is Portfolio Investment]]?
## What Is a [[Portfolio]] Investment?

A [[Portfolio|portfolio]] investment is ownership of a [[Stock|stock]], bond, or other financial asset with the expectation that it [[Will|will]] earn a [[Return|return]] or grow in value over time, or both. It entails passive or hands-off ownership of assets as opposed to [[Direct Investment|direct investment]], which would involve an active management role.

[[Portfolio]] investment may be divided into two main categories:

-   [[Strategic]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/083116/[[Portfolio|portfolio]]-planning-process-step-step.asp) investment involves buying financial assets for their long-term growth potential or their income [[Yield|yield]], or both, with the intention of holding onto those assets for a long time.
-   The [[tactical]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tactical-trading.asp) approach requires active buying and selling activity in hopes of achieving short-term gains.

#### Understanding [[Portfolio]] Investment

## Understanding [[Portfolio]] Investment

The term [[Portfolio|portfolio]] investments covers a wide range of [[asset classes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) including [[Stocks|stocks]], government bonds, corporate bonds, real [[Estate|estate]] investment trusts (REITs), mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and bank [[certificates of deposit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp).

[[Portfolio]] investments can also include more esoteric choices including options and derivatives such as warrants and [[Futures|futures]].

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Portfolio|portfolio]] investment is an asset that is purchased in the expectation that it [[Will|will]] earn a [[Return|return]] or grow in value, or both.
-   A [[Portfolio|portfolio]] investment is passive, unlike a [[Direct Investment|direct investment]], which implies hands-on management.
-   [[Risk]] tolerance and time horizon are key factors in selecting any [[Portfolio|portfolio]] investment.

There also are physical investments such as real [[Estate|estate]], commodities, art, land, timber, and gold.

In fact, a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] investment can be any possession that is purchased for the purpose of generating a [[Return|return]] in the short or [[Long Term|long term]].

### Making Choices

The composition of investments in a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] depends on a number of factors. The most important are the investor’s tolerance for [[Risk|risk]] and investment horizon. Is the investor a young professional with children, a mature person looking forward to retirement, or a retiree looking for a reliable income supplement?

Those with a greater [[Risk|risk]] tolerance may favor investments in growth [[Stocks|stocks]], real [[Estate|estate]], international securities, and options, while more conservative investors may opt for government bonds and blue-chip stocks.

A [[Portfolio|portfolio]] investment can be anything from a [[Stock|stock]] or a mutual fund to real [[Estate|estate]] or art.

On a larger scale, mutual funds and institutional investors are in the business of making [[Portfolio|portfolio]] investments. For the largest institutional investors such as pension funds and sovereign funds, this may include infrastructure assets like bridges and toll roads.

[[Portfolio]] investments by institutional investors generally are held for the [[Long Term|long term]] and are relatively conservative. Pension funds and college [[Endowment|endowment]] funds are not invested in speculative [[Stocks|stocks]].

### [[Portfolio]] Investments for Retirement

Investors saving for retirement are often advised to focus on a diversified mix of low-cost investments for their portfolios.

Index funds have become popular in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) accounts, due to their broad exposure to a number of asset classes at a minimum expense level. These types of funds make ideal core [[Holdings|holdings]] in retirement portfolios.

Those who want a more hands-on approach may tweak their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] allocations by adding additional asset classes such as real [[Estate|estate]], private [[Equity|equity]], and individual [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds to the portfolio mix.
