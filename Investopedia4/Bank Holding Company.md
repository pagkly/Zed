[[Bank Holding Company]]
## What Is a [[Bank Holding Company]]?

A [[Bank Holding Company|bank holding company]] is a corporation that owns a controlling interest in one or more banks but does not itself [[Offer|offer]] banking services.

Holding companies do not run the day-to-day operations of the banks they own. However, they exercise control over management and company policies. They can hire and fire managers, set and evaluate strategies, and monitor the performance of subsidiaries’ businesses.

Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. all are operated by holding companies.

Bank holding companies are regulated by the Federal Reserve. Banks that are not owned by holding companies are regulated primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, although U.S. banking regulations are so complex and far-reaching that a total of five federal agencies are involved.

## Understanding the [[Bank Holding Company]]

Holding companies exist outside of the realm of banks. Some corporations have been formed just to [[Hold|hold]] the assets of several subsidiaries, not to produce any products or services.

### The One-[[Bank Holding Company]]

A variation of the holding company is the one-[[Bank Holding Company|bank holding company]] which, by definition, is a corporation that owns at least one-quarter of the voting [[Stock|stock]] of a commercial bank.

The one-[[Bank Holding Company|bank holding company]] is a creation of the late 1960s. Their formation allowed independent banks the greater operating range of a bank holding company. That is, they could branch out from their dependence on individual depositors into other types of banking activities such as loans and commercial paper.

The ability to issue [[commercial paper]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp) in [[Capital Markets What You Should Know|capital markets]] was a particular priority of the one-bank holding companies. Commercial paper is a key method for a corporation to raise money quickly and cheaply to meet its short-term liabilities and [[Finance|finance]] its accounts receivable and inventories. It is a short-term [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]], rarely maturing in more than 270 days. It does not pay interest in the traditional sense but is issued at a discount from face value.
