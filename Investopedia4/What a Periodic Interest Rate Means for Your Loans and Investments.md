[[What a Periodic Interest Rate Means for Your Loans and Investments]]
## What Is a Periodic Interest Rate?

A periodic interest rate is a rate that can be charged on a [[Loan|loan]], or realized on an investment over a specific period of time. Lenders typically [[Quote|quote]] interest rates on an annual basis, but the [[interest compounds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compound.asp) more frequently than annually in most cases. The periodic interest rate is the annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods.

A greater number of compounding periods allows interest to be earned on or added to interest a greater number of times.

## How a Periodic Interest Rate Works

The number of compounding periods directly affects the periodic interest rate of an investment or a [[Loan|loan]]. An investment's periodic rate is 1% if it has an effective annual [[Return|return]] of 12% and it compounds every month. Its periodic interest rate is 0.00033 if you are compounding the daily periodic rate, it would be the equivalent of 0.03%.

The more frequently an investment compounds, the more quickly it grows. Imagine that two options are available on a $1,000 investment. Under option one, the investor receives an 8% annual interest rate and the interest compounds monthly. Under option two, the investor receives an 8.125% interest rate, compounded annually.

By the end of a 10-year period, the $1,000 investment under option one grows to $2,219.64, but under option two, it grows to $2,184.04. The more frequent compounding of option one yields a greater [[Return|return]] even though the interest rate is higher in option two.

### Key Takeaways

-   Lenders typically [[Quote|quote]] interest rates on an annual basis, but the interest compounds more frequently than annually in most cases.
-   Interest on mortgages usually compounds monthly.
-   Credit card lenders typically calculate interest based on a daily periodic rate so the interest rate is multiplied by the amount the borrower owes at the end of each day.

## Example of a Periodic Interest Rate

The [[interest on a mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgageinterest.asp) is compounded or applied on a monthly basis. If the annual interest rate on that mortgage is 8%, the periodic interest rate used to calculate the interest assessed in any single month is 0.08 divided by 12, working out to 0.0067 or 0.67%.

The remaining [[Principal|principal]] balance of the mortgage [[Loan|loan]] would have a 0.67% interest rate applied to it each month.

## Types of Interest Rates

The annual interest rate typically quoted on loans or investments is the nominal interest rate—the periodic rate _before_ compounding has been taken into account. The effective interest rate is the actual interest rate after the effects of compounding have been included in the calculation.

You must know a [[Loan|loan]]'s nominal rate and the number of compounding periods to calculate its [[effective annual interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectiveinterest.asp). First, divide the nominal rate by the number of compounding periods. The result is the periodic rate. Now add this number to 1 and take the sum by the power of the number of compounding interest rates. Subtract 1 from the product to get the effective interest rate.

For example, if a mortgage compounds monthly and has a nominal annual interest rate of 6%, its periodic rate is 0.5%. When you convert the percentage to a decimal and add 1, the sum is 1.005. This number to the 12th power is 1.0617. When you subtract 1 from this number, the difference is 0.0617 or 6.17%. The effective rate is slightly higher than the nominal rate.

Credit card lenders typically calculate interest based on a daily periodic rate. The interest rate is multiplied by the amount the borrower owes at the end of each day. This interest is then [[added to that day's balance]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-does-it-mean-when-interest-accrues-daily.asp), and the whole process happens again 24 hours later—when what the borrower owes is typically more unless they have made a payment because now their balance includes the previous day's interest. These lenders often [[Quote|quote]] an annual percentage rate (APR), glossing over this [[daily periodic rate calculation]](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-daily-periodic-rate-on-a-credit-card-en-46/). You can identify your daily periodic rate by dividing the APR by 365, although some lenders determine daily periodic rates by dividing by 360.

## Special Consideration

Some revolving loans [[Offer|offer]] a "[[Investopedia/Investopedia5/A Closer Look at Grace Periods|grace period]](https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-3200.html)" from accumulating interest, allowing borrowers to pay off their balances by a certain date within the billing cycle without further interest compounding on their balances. The date and duration of your [[Investopedia/Investopedia5/A Closer Look at Grace Periods|grace period]], if any, should be clearly identified in your contract with the [[Lender|lender]].
