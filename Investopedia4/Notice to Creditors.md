[[Notice to Creditors]]
## What Is a [[Notice to Creditors]]?

The [[Notice to Creditors|notice to creditors]] is a public notice usually posted in a local newspaper by a trust or [[Estate|estate]]'s [[executor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp) as part of the [[probate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Probate|probate]].asp) of the estate of a deceased person. The notice serves as the official notification to both creditors and debtors of the probate of a deceased individual’s estate and may run for a period of weeks depending on state laws.

The executor or executrix—in some states known as the personal representative—is charged with paying outstanding debts and collecting monies owed to the [[Estate|estate]] as part of her duties after being appointed by the court.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Notice to Creditors|notice to creditors]] is a public statement noting the death of an individual in order to alert potential creditors to the situation.
-   Still published in local newspapers, the notice is filed by the [[Estate|estate]]'s executor and meant to facilitate the [[Probate|probate]] proceedings.
-   Creditors [[Will|will]] have a limited amount of time to respond to the notice, which may also be filed by individuals declaring bankruptcy.

## How a [[Notice to Creditors]] Works

In the United States, when a person dies, there is typically at least an informal [[Probate|probate]] process of the deceased's [[Estate|estate]]. The phrase “avoiding probate” refers to the strategy of arranging for the non-probate transfer of assets via trusts, [[Joint|joint]] accounts or other means such as life insurance. Some states have an asset threshold allowing small estates to avoid probate, but if an interested party objects, there are assets requiring probate, or other issues exist, a probate case [[Will|will]] be opened.

Depending on state laws, once [[Probate|probate]] is opened, [[creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) usually have a limited amount of time from the date they were notified of the testator’s death to present any claims against the [[Estate|estate]] for money owed to them. Claims that are rejected by the executor can be filed in court where a probate judge [[Will|will]] have the final say on whether or not the claim must be paid. Even though newspapers have given way to digital and online media, they are still the most commonly used medium with which to send a [[Notice to Creditors|notice to creditors]].

## Notice in Bankruptcy Proceedings

A [[Notice to Creditors|notice to creditors]] is also filed for bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of personal bankruptcy, the notice is filed before the first meeting of creditors, known as a [341 meeting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/341-meeting.asp). Individuals filing Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy must attend this meeting with the [[bankruptcy trustee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy-[[Trustee|trustee]].asp) and creditors may also attend and ask questions.
