[[World Equity Benchmark Series (WEBS)]]
## What Is the World [[Equity]] Benchmark Series?

The World [[Equity]] Benchmark Series is a type of international fund traded on the [[American Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amex.asp). The World Equity Benchmark Series follows the [[Morgan Stanley Capital International]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[MSCI|msci]].asp) (MSCI) country indices. It was introduced in 1996 by Morgan Stanley and is a type of hybrid [[Security|security]] that possesses qualities of both open-end and closed-end funds.

## Understanding [[World Equity Benchmark Series (WEBS)]]

A [[closed-end fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closed-endinvestment.asp) is a fund formed as a publicly traded investment. These funds can raise a designated amount of capital with an initial public [[Offering|offering]]. The money collected goes into a fund that is then [[Listed|listed]] as a [[Stock|stock]] and traded on a public exchange. It is a specialized stock [[Portfolio|portfolio]] with a one-time fixed number of [[Shares|shares]]. An [[open-end fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-endfund.asp) is a conventional mutual fund, made up of a pool of money from many investors for investing in [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds. Investors share gains and losses in proportion to their investment in the fund.

An organization using a World [[Equity]] Benchmark Series owns each of the securities traded on the [[MSCI]] country indices. Ownership is in an approximate ratio to the initial capitalization or investment. A World Equity Benchmark Series can be bought, sold and traded like [[Stocks|stocks]].

Investors can use the World [[Equity]] Benchmark Series to achieve international [[Diversification|diversification]]. The World Equity Benchmark Series is available for many different countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The World Equity Benchmark Series follows reflects around 60% of the capitalization of a country's [[Stock|stock]] market. They are widely used by investors as [[benchmarks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) by which exchange-traded funds are bought and sold.

## World [[Equity]] Benchmark Series and SPDRs

The World [[Equity]] Benchmark Series is similar to the [[SPDR]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spiders.asp) series offered by Standard & Poor's. SPDR stands for Standard & Poor's depositary receipt, and it is an [[exchange-traded fund (ETF)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) managed by State Street Global Advisors that tracks the Standard & Poor's 500 index (S&P 500). Each share of an SPDR contains one-tenth of the [[S&P 500 Index|S&P 500 index]] and trades at roughly at one-tenth the dollar-value level of the S&P 500. SPDRs can also refer to the general group of ETFs to which the Standard & Poor's depositary receipt belongs.

Investors can use SPDRs to realize broad [[Diversification|diversification]] to specific portions of the market. For example, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF is an investment vehicle that seeks to provide investment results that track the total [[Return|return]] performance of the S&P High [[Yield]] Dividend Aristocrats Index. This means that the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF indexes dividend-paying [[Stocks|stocks]] that are a part of the S&P 500. The ETF is made up of a total of 109 companies and tracks performance through its net asset value, which is communicated as a price per share.
