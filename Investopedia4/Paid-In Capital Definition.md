[[Paid-In Capital Definition]]
## What Is Paid-In Capital?

Paid-in capital is the amount of [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) "paid in" by investors during common or [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) issuances, including the [[par value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) of the [[Shares|shares]] themselves plus amounts in excess of par value. Paid-in capital represents the funds raised by the business through selling its [[Equity|equity]] and not from ongoing business operations.

Paid-in capital also refers to a line item on the company's [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) [[Listed|listed]] under stockholders' [[Equity|equity]], often shown alongside the line item for additional paid-in capital.

### Key Takeaways

-   Paid-in capital is the full amount of cash or other assets that shareholders have given a company in exchange for [[Stock|stock]], par value plus any amount paid in excess.
-   Additional paid-in capital refers to only the amount in excess of a [[Stock|stock]]'s par value.
-   Paid-in capital is reported in the shareholder’s [[Equity|equity]] section of the balance sheet.
-   It is usually split into two different line items: [[Common Stock|common stock]] (par value) and additional paid-in capital.

## Understanding Paid-In Capital

For [[common stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp), paid-in capital, also referred to as [[contributed capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contributed-capital.asp), consists of a [[Stock|stock]]'s par value plus any amount paid in excess of par value. In contrast, [[additional paid-in capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/additionalpaidincapital.asp) refers only to the amount of capital in excess of par value or the [[Premium|premium]] paid by investors in [[Return|return]] for the [[Shares|shares]] issued to them. [[Preferred shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/preference-shares/) sometimes have par values that are more than marginal, but most common shares today have par values of just a few pennies. Because of this, "additional paid-in capital" tends to be essentially representative of the total paid-in capital figure and is sometimes shown by itself on the balance sheet.

Additional paid-in capital can provide a significant part of a company's capital before [[retained earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp) start accumulating through multiple years of [[profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp), and it is an important capital layer of defense against potential business losses after [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] have shown a [[deficit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit.asp). Short of the retirement of any [[Shares|shares]], the account balance of paid-in capital, specifically the total par value and the amount of additional paid-in capital, should remain [[Unchanged|unchanged]] as a company carries on its business.

## Special Considerations

### Paid-in Capital From Sale of Treasury [[Stock]]

Companies may [[buy back]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp) [[Shares|shares]] and [[Return|return]] some capital to shareholders from time to time. The shares bought back are [[Listed|listed]] within the shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] section at their repurchase price as [[treasury stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurystock.asp), a [[contra-equity account]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contraaccount.asp) that reduces the total balance of shareholders' equity.

If the treasury [[Stock|stock]] is sold at above its repurchase price, the [[Gain|gain]] is credited to an account called "paid-in capital from treasury stock." If the treasury stock is sold at below its repurchase price, the loss reduces the company's [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]]. If the treasury stock is sold at equal to its repurchase price, the removal of the treasury stock simply restores shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] to its pre-buyback level.

### Paid-in Capital From Retirement of Treasury [[Stock]]

Companies may opt to remove treasury [[Stock|stock]] by retiring some treasury [[Shares|shares]], rather than reissuing them. Once retired, shares are cancelled and cannot be reissued at a later date. The retirement of treasury stock reduces the balance of paid-in capital applicable to the number of retired treasury shares.

If the initial repurchase price of the treasury [[Stock|stock]] was lower than the amount of paid-in capital related to the number of [[Shares|shares]] retired, then "paid-in capital from retirement of treasury stock" is credited. If the initial repurchase price of the treasury stock was higher than the amount of paid-in capital related to the number of shares retired, then the loss reduces the company's [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]].
