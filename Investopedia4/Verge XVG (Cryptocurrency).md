# [[Verge XVG (Cryptocurrency)]]

> ## Excerpt
> Verge (XVG) [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]] relies on TOR and I2P technology to protect user identity, making it a truly anonymous network

[[Verge XVG (Cryptocurrency)]]
Verge is an open-source, decentralized [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]] that claims to [[Offer|offer]] completely anonymous transactions by obfuscating the location and [[IP address]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ip-address.asp) of the transacting participants using TOR and I2P network layers.1 Verge trades on leading [[cryptocurrency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) exchanges with the symbol XVG.2

Verge Currency came into existence in 2014 under the name DogeCoinDark, but was rebranded to Verge Currency in 2016.3

## Rebranding and [[Offering]] Anonymous Transactions

Verge focuses on anonymity and obfuscates users' IP addresses which make transactions completely untraceable. IP stands for internet protocol, the unique identity in the form of numbers assigned to every device or computer connecting to the internet. Using an IP address, it is possible to trace the user and the online activities they performed on the connected device.

Since popular [[public ledgers]](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-[[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]]-public-ledger/) and common cryptocurrencies like [[bitcoin]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp) often face challenges in protecting participants' complete anonymity, cryptocurrencies like Verge that [[Offer|offer]] unique ways to hide users' identities have led to increased use and popularity of such private ledgers.

Verge ensures anonymity by use of multiple anonymity-centric networks such as The Onion Router (TOR) and Invisible Internet Project (I2P). TOR protects users' identities by bouncing their communications over a distributed network of relays and tunnels run by volunteers spread across the globe, while I2P encrypts user data and sends it through a volunteer-run anonymous peer-to-peer globally distributed network.1

While anyone can view the various transactions occurring on the Verge public ledger, the use of TOR and I2P network layers hide the location as well as IP addresses of the transacting participants. The Core Verge wallets have built-in TOR integration, additionally supported by SSL-encryption, adding an extra level of [[Security|security]].

While there are many other cryptocurrencies, like [[Monero]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monero.asp) and [[Dash]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dash.asp), which also claim to [[Offer|offer]] higher levels of privacy and anonymity, they rely on cryptography techniques and implementation. Though such cryptocurrencies have achieved varying levels of success in securing user anonymity, their implementation has also made their respective public ledgers secure but less transparent. This tradeoff at times makes it difficult to publicly verify transactions, a core requirement of decentralized [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]]. (See also, [What Is Monero (XMR) Cryptocurrency?](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/))

Verge tries to tackle this problem technically. It does not rely heavily on cryptography; rather it banks on the existing and tested technology of TOR and I2P network to achieve its goals of user identity protection. Verge's founders say that an open ledger is mandatory for the participants to verify their transactions, and for other participants to publicly authenticate and verify the overall developments occurring on the [[blockchain]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp) without the need for participant’s identity. Verge’s implementation helps it achieve both.

The anonymity of Verge was quoted as the primary reason for an adult website network to start accepting [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]] payments exclusively in the Verge cryptocurrency in April 2018.4 As of December 2020, Verge is ranked 94 in the list of cryptocurrencies by market cap.2
