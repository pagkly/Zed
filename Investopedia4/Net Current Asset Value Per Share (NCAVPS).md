[[Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS)]]
## What Is Net Current Asset Value Per Share?

[[Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS)|Net current asset value per share (NCAVPS)]] is a measure created by [Benjamin Graham](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bengraham.asp) as one means of gauging the attractiveness of a [[Stock|stock]]. A key metric for [value investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp), NCAVPS is calculated by taking a company's [[Current Assets|current assets]] and subtracting total liabilities.

Graham considered [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) to be a [[Liability|liability]], so these are also subtracted. This is then divided by the number of [[Shares|shares]] outstanding. NCAV is similar to [[working capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp), but instead of subtracting current liabilities from [[Current Assets|current assets]], total liabilities and [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] are subtracted.

The formula for NCAVPS is:

NCAVPS = [[Current Assets]] - (Total Liabilities + [[Preferred Stock]]) ÷ [[Shares]] Outstanding

### Key Takeaways

-   Benjamin Graham created [[Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS)|net current asset value per share (NCAVPS)]], a measure that helps investors evaluate a [[Stock|stock]] as a potential investment.
-   NCAVPS is a key metric for value investors and is arrived at by subtracting a company's total liabilities (including [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]]) from its [[Current Assets|current assets]] and dividing the total by the [[Shares|shares]] outstanding.
-   By comparing the NCAVPS with the share price, Graham believed investors could find undervalued [[Stocks|stocks]] at a bargain price.

## Understanding [[Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS)]]

Examining industrial companies, Graham noted that investors typically ignore asset values and focus instead on [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp). But Graham believed that by comparing the [[Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS)|net current asset value per share (NCAVPS)]] with the share price, investors could find bargains.

Essentially, net current asset value is a company's liquidation value. A company's liquidation value is the total worth of all its physical assets, such as fixtures, equipment, inventory, and real [[Estate|estate]]. It excludes [[intangible assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp), such as intellectual property, brand recognition, and goodwill. If a company were to go out of business and sell all its physical assets, the value of these assets would be the company's liquidation value.

So a [[Stock|stock]] that is trading below NCAVPS is allowing an investor to buy a company at less than the value of its [[Current Assets|current assets]]. And as long as the company has reasonable prospects, investors are likely to receive substantially more than they pay for.

## Special Considerations

In addition to NCAVPS, Graham recommended other value investing strategies for identifying undervalued [[Stocks|stocks]]. One such strategy, [[defensive stock investing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defensivestock.asp), means the investor [[Will|will]] purchase stocks that provide stable earnings and dividends regardless of what is going on in the overall [[Stock|stock]] market and economy.

These "defensive [[Stocks|stocks]]" are especially appealing because they protect the investor during times of recession, giving the investor a cushion to weather downturns in the markets. Examples of defensive stocks can often be found in the consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare sectors. These stocks tend to do better during a recession because they are [[non-cyclical]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/082800.asp), meaning they are not highly correlated with the business and economic cycles.

## The Bottom Line

According to Graham, investors [[Will|will]] benefit greatly if they invest in companies where the [[Stock|stock]] prices are no more than 67% of their NCAV per share. And, in fact, a study done by the State University of New York showed that from the period of 1970 to 1983 an investor could have earned an [[average return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averagereturn.asp) of 29.4%, by purchasing [[Stocks|stocks]] that fulfilled Graham's requirement and holding them for one year.

However, Graham made it clear that not all [[Stocks|stocks]] chosen using the NCAVPS formula would have strong returns, and that investors should also diversify their [[holdings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Holdings|holdings]].asp) when using this strategy. Graham recommended holding at least 30 stocks.
