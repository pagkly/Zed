[[Probate]]
## What Is [[Probate]]?

[[Probate]] is the term for a legal process in which a [[will]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Will|will]].asp) is reviewed to determine whether it is valid and authentic. Probate also refers to the general administering of a deceased person's will or the [[Estate|estate]] of a deceased person without a will.

After an asset-holder dies, the court appoints either an executor named in the [[Will|will]] or an administrator (if there is no will) to administer the process of [[Probate|probate]]. This involves collecting the assets of a deceased person to pay any liabilities remaining on the person's [[Estate|estate]], and to distribute the assets of the estate to [beneficiaries](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Probate]] is the legal process for reviewing the assets of a deceased person and determining inheritors.
-   [[Probate]] proceedings are typically focused on the existence of a [[Will|will]].
-   A [[Probate|probate]] proceeding is not always required upon death but is usually essential when a deceased person’s remaining [[Estate|estate]] is of high value.
-   Individuals can avoid exorbitant [[Probate|probate]] costs and complexities by having an easily authenticated [[Will|will]] or using investment vehicles that do not require probate.

## How [[Probate]] Works

[[Probate]] is the analysis and transfer administration of [[estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Estate|estate]].asp) assets previously owned by a deceased person. When a property owner dies, his assets are commonly reviewed by a probate court. The probate court provides the final ruling on the division and distribution of assets to beneficiaries. A probate proceeding [[Will|will]] typically begin by analyzing whether or not the deceased person has provided a legalized will.

In many cases, the deceased person has established documentation, which contains instructions on how their assets should be distributed after death. However, in some cases, the deceased does not leave a [[Will|will]].

## [[Probate]] with a [[Will]]

A deceased person who has provided a [[Will|will]] is known as a testator. When a testator dies, the executor of the will is responsible for initiating the [[Probate|probate]] process. Typically, the [[executor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp) is a financial advisor. The will can also provide details on a specified executor.

The executor is responsible for filing the [[Will|will]] with the [[Probate|probate]] court. States can have different rules for the timeframe in which a will must be filed after death. Filing the will initiates the probate process. The probate process is a court-supervised proceeding in which the authenticity of the will left behind is proven to be valid and accepted as the true [last testament](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/last-will-and-testament.asp) of the deceased. The court officially appoints the executor named in the will, which gives the executor the legal power to act on behalf of the deceased.

### The Executor

A [[Will|will]] typically designates a legal representative or executor approved by the court. This person is responsible for locating and overseeing all the assets of the deceased. The executor has to estimate the value of the [[Estate|estate]] by using either the date of death value or the alternate valuation date, as specified by the [[Internal Revenue Code]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internal-revenue-code.asp) (IRC).

Most assets that are subject to [[Probate|probate]] administration come under the supervision of the probate court in the place where the decedent lived at death. The exception is real [[Estate|estate]]. Probate for real estate may need to be extended to any counties in which the real estate is located.

The executor also has to pay off any taxes and [[Debt|debt]] owed by the deceased from the [[Estate|estate]]. [Creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) usually have a limited amount of time (approximately one year) from the date of death to make any claims against the estate for money owed to them. Claims that are rejected by the executor can be taken to court where a [[Probate|probate]] judge [[Will|will]] have the final say on whether or not the claim is justified.

The executor is also responsible for filing the final, personal [income tax returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/individual-tax-[[Return|return]].asp) on behalf of the deceased. Any [estate taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estatetax.asp) that are pending can also come due within one year from the date of death. After the inventory of the [[Estate|estate]] has been taken, the value of assets calculated, and debts paid off, the executor [[Will|will]] then seek authorization from the court to distribute whatever is left of the estate to the beneficiaries.

If a deceased person’s [[Estate|estate]] is insolvent, which means that their debts outweigh their assets, an administrator [[Will|will]] likely choose not to initiate [[Probate|probate]]. In general, individual states may have their own rulings on a [[statute of limitations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statute-of-limitations.asp) for the processing of a will through probate. States can also have thresholds for probate filings.

## [[Probate]] Without a [[Will]]

When a person dies without a [[Will|will]], he is said to have died intestate. An [intestate estate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intestate.asp) is also one where the will presented to the court has been deemed to be invalid. The [[Probate|probate]] process for an intestate [[Estate|estate]] includes distributing the decedent’s assets according to state laws. If a deceased person has no assets, probate may not be necessary.

In general, a [[Probate|probate]] court proceeding usually begins with the appointment of an [[administrator]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/administrator.asp) to oversee the [[Estate|estate]] of the deceased. The administrator functions as an executor, receiving all legal claims against the estate and paying off the outstanding debts.

The administrator is tasked with locating any legal heirs of the deceased, including surviving spouses, children, and parents. The [[probate court]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Probate|probate]]-court.asp) [[Will|will]] assess what assets need to be distributed among the legal heirs and how to distribute them. The probate laws in most states divide property among the surviving spouse and children of the deceased.

If an individual has no [[Will|will]] and no heirs, any remaining assets go to the state.

Asset transfer to the government is known as [[escheatment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escheat.asp). States do typically have a timeframe for the claiming of any assets by an [[Heir|heir]] who may step forward.

### Spouses as [[Joint]] Property Owners

Community property laws can recognize both spouses as [joint property owners](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointownedproperty.asp) in an intestate proceeding. In effect, the distribution hierarchy typically starts with the surviving spouse. If unmarried or widowed at the time of death, assets are usually divided among any surviving children. After a spouse and children are considered, other relatives may also be deemed appropriate for distribution.

Close friends of the deceased [[Will|will]] not normally be added to the list of beneficiaries under a state’s [[Probate|probate]] laws for intestate estates. However, If the deceased had a [[Joint|joint]] account with [right of survivorship](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/with-benefit-of-survivorship.asp) or owned property jointly with another, the joint asset would automatically be owned by the surviving partner.

## Is a [[Probate]] Always Required?

It is important to know whether a [[Probate|probate]] is required following the death of an individual. The probate process can take a long time to finalize. The more complex or contested the [[Estate|estate]] is, the more time it [[Will|will]] take to settle and distribute the [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp). The longer the duration, the higher the cost.

Probating an [[Estate|estate]] without a [[Will|will]] is typically costlier than probating one with a valid will. However, the time and cost required of each are still high. Also, since the proceedings of a [[Probate|probate]] court are publicly recorded, avoiding probate would ensure that all settlements are done privately.

Different states have different laws concerning [[Probate|probate]] and whether probate is required after the death of a testator. Some states have a specified [[Estate|estate]] value, which requires probate. For example, [[probate laws in Texas]](https://www.thewrightlawyers.com/blog/2018/texas-small-estate-affidavit) [[Hold|hold]] that if the value of the estate is less than $75,000, then probate may be skipped. If an estate is small enough to bypass the probate process, then the estate’s asset may be claimed using alternative legal actions, such as an affidavit. Typically, if a deceased person’s debts exceed their assets, probate is not necessarily initiated and alternative actions may be taken.

Some assets can bypass [[Probate|probate]] because beneficiaries have been [[initiated through contractual terms]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/100616/do-retirement-accounts-go-through-probate.asp). Pension plans, life insurance proceeds, [401k plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp), medical savings accounts, and individual retirement accounts (IRA) that have designated beneficiaries [[Will|will]] not need to be probated. Likewise, assets jointly owned with a right of survivorship can bypass the probate process.

Another popular way to bypass [[Probate|probate]] is through [[the use of a trust]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/121304.asp).

Trust funds can be orchestrated to pass immediately to designated inheritors upon death.

Overall, minimizing costs associated with the [[Probate|probate]] process can be prudent. Accumulated expenses can include court fees, professional service hours, and administration costs. Having an easily authenticated [[Will|will]] is one of the most common ways to quickly move through a probate process and efficiently distribute assets appropriately.
