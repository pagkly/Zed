[[Creditor]]
## What Is a [[Creditor]]?

A [[Creditor|creditor]] is an entity (person or institution) that extends credit by giving another entity permission to borrow money intended to be repaid in the future. A business that provides supplies or services to a company or individual and does not demand payment immediately is also considered a creditor, based on the fact that the client owes the business money for services already rendered.

Creditors can be classified as either personal or real. People who [[Loan|loan]] money to friends or family are personal creditors. Real creditors such as [[banks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-capital.asp) or [[Finance|finance]] companies have legal contracts with the borrower, sometimes granting the [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) the right to claim any of the [[Debtor|debtor]]'s [[real assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realasset.asp) (e.g., [real estate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp) or cars) if they fail to pay back the loan.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Creditor|creditor]] is an entity that extends credit, giving another entity permission to borrow money to be repaid in the future.
-   A business that provides supplies or services and does not demand immediate payment is also a [[Creditor|creditor]], as the client owes the business money for services already rendered.
-   Personal creditors who cannot recoup a [[Debt|debt]] may be able to claim it as a short-term capital gains loss on their income [[Tax Return|tax return]]. 
-   Creditors such as banks can repossess [[Collateral|collateral]] like homes and cars on secured loans, and they can take debtors to court over [[Unsecured|unsecured]] debts.

## Understanding Creditors

Simply, creditors make money by charging interest on the loans they [[Offer|offer]] their clients. For example, if a [[Creditor|creditor]] lends a borrower $5,000 with a 5% interest rate, the [[Lender|lender]] makes money due to the interest on the [[Loan|loan]]. In turn, the creditor accepts a degree of [[Risk|risk]] that the borrower may not repay the loan.

To mitigate [[Risk|risk]], most creditors index their interest rates or fees to the borrower's [[creditworthiness]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp) and past credit history. Thus, being a responsible borrower could save you a substantial sum, particularly if you are taking out a large [[Loan|loan]], like a mortgage. Interest rates for mortgages vary based on a myriad of factors, including the size of the down payment and the [[Lender|lender]] itself; however, one's [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]] has a primary impact on the interest rate.

Borrowers with great [[credit scores]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) are considered low-[[Risk|risk]] to creditors, and as a result, these borrowers garner low interest rates. In contrast, borrowers with low credit scores are riskier for creditors, and creditors charge them higher interest rates to address that risk. 

## What Happens If Creditors Are Not Repaid?

If a [[Creditor|creditor]] does not receive repayment, they have a few different options. Personal creditors who cannot recoup a [[Debt|debt]] may be able to claim it as a short-term capital gains loss on their income [[Tax Return|tax return]], but to do so, they must make a significant effort to reclaim the debt.

Creditors such as banks can repossess [[Collateral|collateral]] such as homes and cars on secured loans, and they can take debtors to court over [[Unsecured|unsecured]] debts. [[The courts may order the debtor to pay, garnish wages, or take other actions]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061715/what-difference-between-[[Lien|lien]]-and-[[Encumbrance|encumbrance]].asp).

## Creditors and Bankruptcy

If a [[debtor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debtor|debtor]].asp) decides to declare [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp), the court notifies the [[Creditor|creditor]] of the proceedings. In some bankruptcy cases, all of the debtor's non-essential assets are sold to repay debts, and the bankruptcy [[Trustee|trustee]] repays the debts in order of their priority.

Tax debts and child support typically get the highest priority along with criminal fines, overpayments of federal benefits, and a handful of other debts. [[Unsecured]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Unsecured|unsecured]].asp) loans such as credit cards are prioritized last, giving those creditors the smallest chance of recouping funds from debtors during bankruptcy proceedings.
