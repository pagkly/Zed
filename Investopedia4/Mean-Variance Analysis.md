[[Mean-Variance Analysis]]
## What Is a [[Mean-Variance Analysis]]?

[[Mean-Variance Analysis|Mean-variance analysis]] is the process of weighing [[Risk|risk]], expressed as variance, against expected [[Return|return]]. Investors use mean-variance analysis to make investment decisions. Investors weigh how much risk they are willing to take on in exchange for different levels of reward. Mean-variance analysis allows investors to find the [[biggest reward at a given level of risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Stocks|stocks]]/11/calculating-risk-reward.asp) or the [[least risk at a given level of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp).

### Key Takeaways:

-   [[Mean-Variance Analysis|Mean-variance analysis]] is a tool used by investors to weigh investment decisions.
-   The analysis helps investors determine the biggest reward at a given level of [[Risk|risk]] or the least risk at a given level of [[Return|return]].
-   The variance shows how spread out the returns of a specific [[security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) are on a daily or weekly basis. 
-   The expected [[Return|return]] is a probability expressing the estimated return of the investment in the [[Security|security]].
-   If two different securities have the same expected [[Return|return]], but one has lower variance, the one with lower variance is preferred.
-   Similarly, if two different securities have approximately the same variance, the one with the higher [[Return|return]] is preferred.

## Understanding [[Mean-Variance Analysis]]

[[Mean-Variance Analysis|Mean-variance analysis]] is one part of [[modern portfolio theory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp), which assumes that investors [[Will|will]] make rational decisions about investments if they have complete information. One assumption is that investors seek low [[Risk|risk]] and high reward. There are two main components tof mean-variance analysis: variance and expected [[Return|return]]. [[Variance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp) is a number that represents how varied or spread out the numbers are in a set. For example, variance may tell how spread out the returns of a specific [[security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) are on a daily or weekly basis. The expected return is a probability expressing the estimated return of the investment in the security. If two different securities have the same expected return, but one has lower variance, the one with lower variance is the better pick. Similarly, if two different securities have approximately the same variance, the one with the higher return is the better pick.

In [[modern portfolio theory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp), an investor would choose different securities to invest in with different levels of variance and expected [[Return|return]]. The goal of this strategy is to differentiate investments, which reduces the [[Risk|risk]] of catastrophic loss in the event of rapidly changing market conditions.

## Example of [[Mean-Variance Analysis]]

It is possible to calculate which investments have the greatest variance and expected [[Return|return]]. Assume the following investments are in an investor's [[Portfolio|portfolio]]:

Investment A: Amount = $100,000 and expected [[Return|return]] of 5%

Investment B: Amount = $300,000 and expected [[Return|return]] of 10%

In a total [[Portfolio|portfolio]] value of $400,000, the weight of each asset is:

Investment A weight = $100,000 / $400,000 = 25%

Investment B weight = $300,000 / $400,000 = 75%

Therefore, the total expected [[Return|return]] of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is the weight of the asset in the portfolio multiplied by the expected return:

[[Portfolio]] expected [[Return|return]] = (25% x 5%) + (75% x 10%) = 8.75%. [[Portfolio Variance|Portfolio variance]] is more complicated to calculate because it is not a simple [[Weighted|weighted]] average of the investments' variances. The [[Correlation|correlation]] between the two investments is 0.65. The [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]], or square root of variance, for Investment A is 7%, and the standard deviation for Investment B is 14%. 

In this example, the [[Portfolio Variance|portfolio variance]] is:

[[Portfolio Variance|Portfolio variance]] = (25% ^ 2 x 7% ^ 2) + (75% ^ 2 x 14% ^ 2) + (2 x 25% x 75% x 7% x 14% x 0.65) = 0.0137

The [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] is the square root of the answer: 11.71%.
