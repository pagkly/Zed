[[Quantity Demanded]]
## What Is [[Quantity Demanded]]?

[[Quantity Demanded|Quantity demanded]] is a term used in [[Economics|economics]] to describe the total amount of a good or service that consumers demand over a given interval of time. It depends on the price of a good or service in a marketplace, regardless of whether that market is in [[equilibrium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp).

The relationship between the [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] and the price is known as the [[Demand Curve|demand curve]], or simply the demand. The degree to which the quantity demanded changes with respect to price is called the [[elasticity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elasticity.asp) of demand.

### Key Takeaways

-   In [[Economics|economics]], [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] refers to the total amount of a good or service that consumers demand over a given period of time.
-   [[Quantity Demanded|Quantity demanded]] depends on the price of a good or service in a marketplace.
-   The price of a product and the quantity demand for that product have an inverse relationship, according to the law of demand.

## Understanding [[Quantity Demanded]]

### Inverse Relationship of Price and Demand

The price of a good or service in a marketplace determines the quantity that consumers demand. Assuming that non-price factors are removed from the equation, a higher price results in a lower [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] and a lower price results in higher quantity demanded. Thus, the price of a product and the quantity demanded for that product have an inverse relationship, as stated in the [[law of demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdemand.asp).

An inverse relationship means that higher prices result in lower quantity demand and lower prices result in higher quantity demand.

### Change in [[Quantity Demanded]]

A change in [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] refers to a change in the specific quantity of a product that buyers are willing and able to buy. This change in quantity demanded is caused by a change in the price.

### Increase in [[Quantity Demanded]]

An increase in [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] is caused by a decrease in the price of the product (and vice versa). A [[Demand Curve|demand curve]] illustrates the quantity demanded and any price offered on the market. A change in quantity demanded is represented as a movement along a demand curve. The proportion that quantity demanded changes relative to a change in price is known as the elasticity of demand and is related to the slope of the demand curve.

## An Example of [[Quantity Demanded]]

Say, for example, at the price of $5 per hot dog, consumers buy two hot dogs per day; the [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] is two. If vendors decide to increase the price of a hot dog to $6, then consumers only purchase one hot dog per day. On a graph, the quantity demanded moves leftward from two to one when the price rises from $5 to $6. If, however, the price of a hot dog decreases to $4, then customers want to consume three hot dogs: the quantity demanded moves rightward from two to three when the price falls from $5 to $4.Â 

By graphing these combinations of price and [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]], we can construct a [[demand curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/11/intro-[[Supply|supply]]-demand.asp) connecting the three points.

Using a standard [[Demand Curve|demand curve]], each combination of price and [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] is depicted as a point on the downward sloping line, with the price of hot dogs on the [[Y|y]]-axis and the quantity of hot dogs on the x-axis. This means that as price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. Any change or movement to quantity demanded is involved as a movement of the point along the demand curve and not a shift in the demand curve itself. As long as consumers' preferences and other factors don't change, the demand curve effectively remains static.

Price changes change the [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]]; changes in consumer preferences change the [[Demand Curve|demand curve]]. If, for example, environmentally conscious consumers switch from gas cars to electric cars, the demand curve for traditional cars would inherently shift.

## Price Elasticity of Demand

The proportion to which the [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] changes with respect to price is called elasticity of demand. A good or service that is highly elastic means the quantity demanded varies widely at different price points.

Conversely, a good or service that is inelastic is one with a [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] that remains relatively static at varying price points. An example of an inelastic good is insulin. Regardless of price point, those who need insulin demand it at the same amount.
