Underlying
## What Does Underlying Mean?

Underlying, when referred to in reference to equity trading, is the common stock that must be delivered when a [[warrant]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrant.asp) is exercised, or when a [[convertible bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertiblebond.asp) or [[convertible preferred share]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/05/052705.asp) is converted to common stock. The price of the underlying is the main factor that determines the prices of derivative securities, warrants, and [[convertibles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertibles.asp). Therefore, a change in the price of the underlying results in a simultaneous change [[in the price of the derivative asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/derivative/) linked to it.

## Understanding Underlying

Underlying applies to both equities and derivatives. In derivatives, underlying refers to the security that must be delivered when a derivative contract, such as a put or call option, is exercised.

There are two main types of investments: debt and [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp). The debt must be paid back and investors are compensated in the form of interest payments. Equity is not required to be paid back and investors are compensated by [[share price appreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/how-companys-share-price-determined.asp) or [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp). Both of these investments have specific [[cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) and benefits depending on the individual investor.

## Financial Derivatives

There are other financial instruments based solely on the movement of debt and equity. There are financial instruments that go up when [[interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) go up. There are also financial instruments that go down when stock prices go down. These financial instruments are based on the performance of the [[underlying asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp), or the debt and equity that is the original investment. This class of [[financial instruments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp) is referred to as derivatives as it derives value from movements in the underlying. Generally, the underlying is a security, such as a stock in the case of options, or a commodity in the case of futures.

## An Underlying Example

Two of the most common types of derivatives are referred to as [[calls and puts]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/10/hedging-puts-calls.asp). A call derivative contract gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy a particular stock or asset at a given [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp). If company A is trading at $5 and the strike price is hit at $3, the price of the stock is trending up, the call is theoretically worth $2. In this case, the underlying is the stock priced at $5, and the derivative is the call priced at $2. A put derivative contract gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a particular stock at a given strike price. If company A is trading at $5 and the strike price is hit at $7, the price of the stock is trending down, the put is trading $2 in the money and is theoretically worth $2. In this case, the underlying is the stock priced at $5 and the derivative is the put contract priced at $2. Both the call and the put are dependent on price movements in the underlying asset, which in this case is the stock price of company A.
