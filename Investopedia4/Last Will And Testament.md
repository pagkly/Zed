[[Last Will And Testament]]
## What Is a [[Last Will And Testament|Last Will and Testament]]?

A [[Last Will And Testament|last will and testament]] is a legal document that communicates a person's final wishes pertaining to assets and dependents. A person's last [[Will|will]] and testament outlines what to do with possessions, whether the deceased will leave them to another person, a group or donate them to charity, and what happens to other things that they are responsible for, such as custody of [[dependents]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent.asp) and management of accounts and financial [interests](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp). Some states do allow for non-standard or unusual wills, such as a [[holographic will]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holographic-will.asp), while others do not.

### Key Takeaways

-   If parents with children die without a [[Last Will And Testament|last will and testament]], the courts [[Will|will]] appoint a guardian for their minors.
-   If you die intestate, your [[Estate|estate]] is settled by the courts, including the distribution of all assets.
-   Writing a [[Will|will]] and testament gives you some control over what happens to your assets after your death.
-   Life insurance policies with named beneficiaries do not pass through [[Probate|probate]] court.

## How a [[Last Will And Testament]] Works

A person writes a [[Will|will]] while still alive and its instructions are only carried out once the individual dies. A will names a still-living person as the [[executor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp) of the [[Estate|estate]], and that person is responsible for administering the estate. The [[probate court]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Probate|probate]]-court.asp) usually supervises the executor to ensure that h the wishes specified in the will are carried out.

A [[Will|will]] and last testament forms the [[foundation of an estate plan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp) and is the key instrument used to ensure that the [[Estate|estate]] is settled in the manner desired by the deceased. While there can be more to an estate plan than just a will, it is the presiding document the [[Probate|probate]] court uses to guide the process of settling an estate.

Any assets not already designated by a beneficiary, such as a life insurance policy or [[qualified retirement plan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qrp.asp), are not included as [[Probate|probate]] assets and pass directly to the beneficiaries.

Specifically, a [[Will|will]] and last testament instructs the court in the [[disposition]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Disposition|disposition]].asp) of all assets, including who is to receive them and in what amount. It establishes guardian arrangements for surviving dependents and accounts for any special circumstances, which may include the care of a special-needs child or an aging parent.

Addenda to the [[Will|will]], such as [[power of attorney]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/powerofattorney.asp) or a medical directive, can direct the court on how to handle matters if a person becomes physically or mentally incapacitated.

## Consequences of No [[Will]] and Testament

When a person dies without a valid [[Will|will]] it is said that they have died [[intestate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intestate.asp), which means the state becomes the executor of the [[Estate|estate]]. In settling the estate, the state decides how to distribute the property and who receives payment first, without any consideration for a family’s circumstances.

Any blood relative can stake a claim to the [[Estate|estate]]. The court can even establish guardianship arrangements based on its determination as to the best interests of the children. If a court determines a [[Will|will]] is improperly drafted, it deems it invalid. The settlement of the estate is then subject to the state's intestate law.
