[[What Does It Mean to Be Tax Exempt]]?
## Defining Tax Exempt

Tax-exempt refers to income or transactions that are free from tax at the federal, state, or local level. The reporting of tax-free items may be on a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]'s individual or business [[Tax Return|tax return]] and shown for informational purposes only. The tax-exempt article is not part of any tax calculations.

Tax-exempt may also refer to the status of a business or organization which has limits on the amount of income or gifts which are taxable. These organizations include religious and charitable institutions.1

## Common Tax Exempt Earnings

Not to be confused with a [[tax deduction]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-deduction.asp), tax-exempt frees the [[taxpayer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/[[Taxpayer|taxpayer]].asp) of any tax obligation to submit taxes on the tax-free transaction or income. Whereas, the use of a tax deduction is to reduce the tax obligation by lowering [[gross income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp).

One common type of tax-[[Exempt Income|exempt income]] is interest earned on [[municipal bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp), which are bonds issued by states and cities to raise funds for general operations or a specific project. When a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] makes interest income on municipal bonds issued in their state of residence, the profit is exempt from both federal and state taxes.2

 Taxpayers receive IRS Form [1099-INT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-1099-int.asp) for any investment interest they earn during the tax year. The reporting of [[Tax-Exempt Interest|tax-exempt interest]] is in box 8 of the 1099 form.3 This informational only data are not included in the calculation of personal income taxes.2

## Capital Gains Tax Exemption

A [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] may buy an asset and subsequently sell that asset for a profit. The profit is a capital [[Gain|gain]], which creates a taxable event. 4 However, several types of capital gains are exempt from [[Taxation|taxation]]. 

A [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] can offset [[capital gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/tax-effects-capital-gains.asp) with other [[capital losses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalloss.asp) for the tax year. For example, an investor with $5,000 in profits and $3,000 in losses pays taxes on only $2,000 in capital gains. The amount of capital losses a taxpayer may claim in a given year has a cap of $3,000. When capital losses exceed this cap, the excess may be carried forward to offset gains in future years.4 

The tax code also allows taxpayers to exclude from federal taxes a specific portion of capital gains from the sale of a home.5

## Alternative Minimum Tax and Exemptions

The [[alternative minimum tax]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp) (AMT) is an alternative method for determining [[Tax Liability|tax liability]]. AMT adds back specific tax-exempt items into the personal tax calculation.6 Interest from private activity bonds exempt from regular tax, for example, is added to the AMT tax calculation.7 Individual taxpayers must include the AMT calculation with their original [[Tax Return|tax return]] and pay tax on the higher tax [[Liability|liability]].6

## Tax-Exempt Organizations

An exempt organization that has $1,000 or more of gross income from an unrelated business must file Form 990-T. An organization must pay estimated tax if it expects its tax for the year to be $500 or more.

A [501(c)(3)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/501c3-organizations.asp) nonprofit corporation is a charitable organization that the IRS recognizes as tax-exempt. This type of organization does not pay income tax on its earnings or on the donations it receives. Also, any [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] donations may reduce a taxpayer's [[Taxable Income|taxable income]] by the donation amount.8 This incentive encourages private charity and makes it easier for nonprofits to raise money.

A 501(c)(3) is a charitable organization involved in religious, charitable, educational, literary, preventing cruelty to animals and children, fostering amateur local and international sports competition, testing for public safety, and scientific activities or operations.8 (For related reading, see "[5 Groups That Don't Pay Taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-groups-that-dont-pay-taxes.aspx)")
