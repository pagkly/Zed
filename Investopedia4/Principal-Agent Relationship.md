[[Principal-Agent Relationship]]
## What Is the [[Principal-Agent Relationship]]?

The [[Principal-Agent Relationship|principal-agent relationship]] is an arrangement in which one entity legally appoints another to act on its behalf. In a [[Principal|principal]]-agent relationship, the agent acts on behalf of the principal and should not have a [[conflict of interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-of-interest.asp) in carrying out the act. The relationship between the principal and the agent is called the "agency," and the law of agency establishes guidelines for such a relationship.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Principal|principal]] appoints an agent to act on their behalf and in their best interest. Examples include an investor picking a fund manager or someone hiring an attorney for legal work. 
-   There should be no conflict of interest between the two, if there is, this creates a [[Principal-Agent Problem|principal-agent problem]]. 
-   The [[Principal-Agent Relationship|principal-agent relationship]] is expressed clearly through a written contract or is implied through actions.

## Understanding a [[Principal-Agent Relationship]]

A [[Principal-Agent Relationship|principal-agent relationship]] is often defined in formal terms described in a contract. For example, when an investor buys [[Shares|shares]] of an index fund, he is the [[Principal|principal]], and the [[fund manager]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundmanager.asp) becomes his agent. As an agent, the [[index fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) manager must manage the fund, which consists of many principals' assets, in a way that [[Will|will]] maximize returns for a given level of [[Risk|risk]] in accordance with the fund's [[prospectus]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp).

Agents have an obligation to perform tasks with a certain level of skill and care and may not intentionally or negligently complete the task in an improper manner.

The [[Principal-Agent Relationship|principal-agent relationship]] can be entered into by any willing and able parties for the purpose of any legal transaction. In simple cases, the [[Principal|principal]] within the relationship is a sole individual who assigns an agent to carry out a task; however, other relationships under this guise have a principal that is a corporation, a nonprofit organization, a government agency or a partnership.

The agent is most often an individual capable of understanding and ultimately carrying out the task assigned by the [[Principal|principal]]. Common examples of the [[Principal-Agent Relationship|principal-agent relationship]] include hiring a contractor to complete a repair on a home, retaining an attorney to perform legal work, or asking an investment advisor to diversify a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of [[Stocks|stocks]]. In each scenario, the principal is the individual seeking out the service or advice of a professional, while the agent is the professional performing the work.

## Special Considerations

Whether the [[Principal-Agent Relationship|principal-agent relationship]] is expressed clearly through a written contract or is implied through actions, the [[Principal|principal]]-agent relationship creates a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary]] relationship between the parties involved. This means the agent acting on behalf of the principal must carry out the assigned tasks with the principal's best interest as a priority.

The agent is responsible for completing tasks given by the [[Principal|principal]] so long as the principal provides reasonable instruction. Additionally, the agent has an obligation to perform tasks that [[Will|will]] not intentionally harm the principal. A duty of loyalty is also implied within the [[Principal-Agent Relationship|principal-agent relationship]], which requires the agent to refrain from putting himself in a position that creates or encourages conflict between his interest and the interest of the principal, also known as the [[principal-agent problem]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-agent-problem.asp).
