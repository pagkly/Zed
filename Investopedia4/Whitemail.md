[[Whitemail]]
## What Is [[Whitemail]]?

[[Whitemail]] is a defensive strategy that a takeover target can use to try to thwart a [[hostile takeover attempt.]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hostile-takeover-bid.asp) Whitemail involves the target firm issuing a large number of [[Shares|shares]] at below-market prices, which are then sold to a friendly [[Third Party|third party]].

This helps the target avoid the takeover by increasing the number of [[Shares|shares]] the acquirer must purchase in order to [[Gain|gain]] control, thus increasing the price of the takeover. It also dilutes the firm's shares. Plus, since a friendly [[Third Party|third party]] now owns and controls a large block of shares, the aggregate number of friendly shareholders increases.

If the [[Whitemail|whitemail]] strategy is successful in discouraging the takeover, then the company can either buy back the issued [[Shares|shares]] or leave them outstanding.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Whitemail]] is a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]] defense that involves issuing a large number of new [[Shares|shares]] to friendly shareholders.
-   The goal is to dilute the [[Shares|shares]] enough and secure sufficient proxy votes to fend off an unwanted acquirer.
-   A successful [[Whitemail|whitemail]] defense can conclude with the target company re-acquiring its new [[Shares|shares]].

## Understanding [[Whitemail]]

There are two main tactics employed to acquire a controlling interest in a company as a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]] bid.

First, the acquirer may make a [tender offer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tenderoffer.asp) to the company's shareholders. A tender [[Offer|offer]] is a bid to buy a controlling share of the target's [[Stock|stock]] at a fixed price. The price is usually set above the current market price to allow the sellers a [[Premium|premium]] as an added incentive to sell their [[Shares|shares]]. This is a formal offer and may include specifications included by the acquirer such as an offer expiry window or other items. Paperwork must be filed with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC), and the acquirer must provide a summary of its plans for the target company to aid the target company's decision.

Many takeover defense strategies protect against tender offers, so often the proxy fight is utilized. The goal of a [proxy fight](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxyfight.asp) is to replace board members who are not in favor of the takeover with new board members who would vote for the takeover. This is done by convincing shareholders that a change in management is needed and that the board members who would be appointed by the would-be acquirer are just what the doctor ordered.

[[Whitemail]] is a strategy that can be used to fend off an unwanted takeover attempt by issuing [[Shares|shares]] at a below-market price and selling them to friendly a [[Third Party|third party]]. These new shares undermine the tender [[Offer|offer]] by making it relatively more expensive for the acquirer to attempt this route. At the same time, the new friendly shareholder [[Will|will]] be less likely to agree to a tender offer or to a proxy fight to install new board members.

[[Whitemail]] is just [[one of several defensive strategies]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Stocks|stocks]]/08/corporate-takeover-defense.asp) to avert a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]].

## Example of [[Whitemail]]

XYZ Corporation has 1,000,000 [[Shares|shares]] outstanding. ABC Inc. wants to acquire XYZ Corp. and begins to buy up all of the shares they can in the public [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp) in an attempt to get to a controlling proportion of shares.

XYZ Corp. gets wind of this and proceeds to institute a [[Whitemail|whitemail]] policy. They issue 250,000 new [[Shares|shares]] at a significant discount to the current secondary market price and sell them all to DEF Industries, which is a company that XYZ has a good relationship with.

The increase of outstanding [[Shares|shares]] from 1,000,000 to 1,250,000 increases the number of shares ABC [[Will|will]] need to purchase in order to [[Gain|gain]] a controlling interest. Plus, the voting rights of all XYZ shares are now diluted, reducing ABC's power to vote for board members who favor their takeover.
