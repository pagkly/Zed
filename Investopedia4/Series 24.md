[[Series 24]]
## What Is the [[Series 24]]?

The [[Series 24]] is an exam and license entitling the holder to supervise and manage branch activities at a [[broker-dealer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp). It is also known as the General Securities [[Principal]] Qualification Examination and was designed to test the knowledge and competency of candidates aiming to become entry-level securities principals. Supervisory activities allowed after passing the exam include regulatory compliance over trading and market-making activities, underwriting, and advertising.

The [[Series 24]] exam is administered by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp) and covers topics such as corporate securities, [[real estate investment trusts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp), trading, customer accounts, and regulatory guidelines. In order to be eligible for a [[Principal|principal]] registration, a candidate must pass the Series 24 exam, the securities industry essentials (SIE) exam, and one of the following five representative-level qualification exams: Series 7, 57, 79, 82, or 86/87. Candidates can also pass the Series 24 and Series 16 exams but not the SIE and qualify for the research principal registration.

## Understanding the [[Series 24]] Exam

The examination contains 150 scored questions and 10 questions that are not scored, with the non-scored questions randomly distributed throughout the exam. To pass, a candidate must correctly answer at least 105 questions of the 150 scored questions. This equates to a score of 70%. The test administrator provides electronic calculators and dry-erase boards and markers. No other calculators, reference, or study materials are permitted in the examination room.

Candidates have a maximum time of three hours and 45 minutes to complete the exam. A FINRA [[member firm]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/memberfirm.asp) or other applicable firms can register a candidate to take the exam by filing a Form U4 and paying the $120 examination fee.

The [[Series 24]] content is grouped into the five main job functions that a general securities [[Principal|principal]] engages in regularly [[at work for a broker-dealer]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072913/what-brokerdealer-and-why-should-you-care.asp).
