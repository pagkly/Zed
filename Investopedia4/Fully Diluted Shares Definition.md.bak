[[Fully Diluted Shares Definition]]
## What are Fully Diluted [[Shares]]?

Fully diluted [[Shares|shares]] are the total number of common shares of a company that [[Will|will]] be outstanding and available to trade on the open market after all possible sources of conversion, such as [[convertible bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertiblebond.asp) and [[employee stock options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eso.asp), are exercised. Fully diluted shares include not only those which are currently issued but also those that could be claimed through conversion. This number of shares is needed for a company’s [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic-earnings-per-share.asp) (EPS) calculations because applying fully diluted shares increases the share basis in the calculation while reducing the dollars earned per share of [[Common Stock|common stock]].

## Understanding Fully Diluted [[Shares]]

Fully diluted [[Shares|shares]] affect the EPS of a company, which is a common metric for assessing relative value and profitability. EPS represents net income minus preferred dividends, divided by the [[Weighted|weighted]] average of common shares outstanding, in which the weighted average of common shares outstanding = (beginning period balance + ending period balance) / 2.

If a company can increase earnings per common share, it is considered to be more valuable and the publicly traded share price may increase. However, the number of outstanding [[Shares|shares]] affects this metric and, when the number increases, it reduces the EPS.

### Key Takeaways

-   While full dilution may not occur all at once, it indicates how many [[Shares|shares]] might be outstanding in the future, based on current company policy regarding conversions.
-   Earnings paid to [[preferred shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) as cash dividends are subtracted from net income because EPS applies only to common shareholders.
-   Company policy regarding conversions may change over time, potentially impacting expectations about the future number of fully diluted [[Shares|shares]].

## Factoring in Fully Diluted [[Shares]]

Assume that ABC Corporation (ABC) generates $10 million in [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) and pays preferred shareholders a total of $2 million in dividends. The net income available to common shareholders is $8 million. If the firm’s [[Weighted|weighted]] average of common [[Shares|shares]] outstanding totals 1 million, the EPS [[Will|will]] be $8.00 per share or ($8 million / 1 million shares). This $8.00 EPS is referred to as "basic" EPS because the total is not adjusted for dilution.

Full dilution means that every [[Security|security]] that can be converted into common [[Shares|shares]] has been converted, indicating there [[Will|will]] be fewer earnings available per share of [[Common Stock|common stock]]. Since EPS is a key measure of a company’s value and profitability, it is important for an [[investor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) to review basic EPS as well as fully diluted EPS.

## Example of Fully Diluted [[Shares]]

Several types of securities can be converted into [[Common Stock|common stock]], including convertible bonds, convertible [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], employee [[Stock|stock]] options, rights, and [[warrants]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Warrant|warrant]].asp).

Assume that ABC issues 100,000 [[Shares|shares]] in [[Stock|stock]] options to employees to reward them for strong company performance. The firm has convertible bonds outstanding that allow bondholders to convert their securities into a total of 200,000 shares of [[Common Stock|common stock]]. ABC also has convertible [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] outstanding and those shares can be converted into 200,000 shares of common stock as well.

Full dilution assumes that all 500,000 additional [[Common Stock|common stock]] [[Shares|shares]] are issued, which increases the common shares outstanding to 1.5 million. Applying the $8 million in earnings to common shareholders, fully diluted EPS [[Will|will]] be ($8 million / 1.5 million shares) or $5.33 per share, which is lower than the basic EPS of $8.00 per share.
