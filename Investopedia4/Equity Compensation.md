## Types of [[Equity Compensation]]

### [[Stock]] Options

Companies that [[Offer|offer]] [[Equity Compensation|equity compensation]] can give employees [[stock options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp) that offer the right to purchase [[Shares|shares]] of the companies' [[Stocks|stocks]] at a predetermined price, also referred to as [[exercise price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp). This right may vest with time, allowing employees to [[Gain|gain]] control of this option after working for the company for a certain period of time. When the option vests, they gain the right to sell or transfer the option. This method encourages employees to stick with the company for the [[Long Term|long term]]. However, the option typically has an expiration.

Employees who have this option are not considered stockholders and do not share the same rights as [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp). There are different tax consequences to options that are vested versus those that are not, so employees must look into what tax rules apply to their specific situations.

### Non-Qualified [[Stock]] Options (NSOs) and Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)

Additional types of [[Equity Compensation|equity compensation]] include [[non-qualified stock options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nso.asp) (NSO) and [[incentive stock options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iso.asp) (ISOs). ISOs are only available to employees (and not non-employee directors or consultants). These options [[provide special tax advantages]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/061615/how-[[Stock|stock]]-options-are-taxed-reported.asp). For example, with non-qualified stock options, employers do not have to report when they receive this option or when it becomes exercisable.

### [[Restricted Stock]]

[Restricted stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp) requires the completion of a vesting period. Vesting may be done all at once after a certain period of time. Alternatively, vesting may be done equally over a set period of years, or any other combination that the management of a company finds suitable. [[Restricted Stock|Restricted stock]] units (RSUs) are similar, but they represent the company's promise to pay [[Shares|shares]] based on a vesting schedule. This offers some advantages to the company, but employees do not [[Gain|gain]] any rights of [[Stock|stock]] ownership, such as voting, until the shares are earned and issued.

### Performance [[Shares]]

[Performance shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/performanceshares.asp) are awarded only if certain specified measures are met. These could include metrics, such as an [[Earnings Per Share (EPS)|earnings per share (EPS)]] target, [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]] (ROE), or the total return of the company's [[Stock|stock]] in relation to an index. Typically, performance periods are over a multi-year time horizon.
