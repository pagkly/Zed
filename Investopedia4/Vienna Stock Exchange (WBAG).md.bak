## History of the Vienna [[Stock]] Exchange

Founded in 1771 by the empress Maria Theresa, the Vienna [[Stock]] Exchange is one of the oldest in the world. In its first years, it was a marketplace for trading [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), [[bills of exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/billofexchange.asp), and foreign currencies. The first time that [[Shares|shares]] were traded was in 1818, and the first corporation to be [[Listed|listed]] on the exchange was the Austrian [[National Bank]].

World War I saw the close of the Vienna [[Stock]] Exchange until the end of 1919. After the war, the exchange experienced a strong revival, which subsequently ended suddenly in March 1934. The global economic crisis and bank collapse affected exchange trading during these years; however, it should be noted the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash-1929.asp) in the United States did not have much impact.

In 1938, the incorporation of Austria into the Deutsche Reich caused Wiener Börse to lose its independence. Limited [[Stock|stock]] market trading continued from then until right before the end of World War II.

After the war, the exchange opened back up in 1948. The [[Stock|stock]] market was not as [[Robust|robust]], but the bond market recovered in 1952. Bond market trading grew until a turnaround in 1985 when an American analyst drew attention to the potential of the Austrian capital market, which triggered a stock boom.
