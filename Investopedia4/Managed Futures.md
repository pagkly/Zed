[[Managed Futures]]
## What Are [[Managed Futures]]?

[[Managed Futures|Managed futures]] refers to an investment where a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of [[futures contracts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp) is actively managed by professionals. Managed [[Futures|futures]] are considered an alternative investment and are often used by funds and institutional investors to provide both portfolio and market [[diversification]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Diversification|diversification]].asp).

[[Managed Futures|Managed futures]] provide this [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Diversification|diversification]] by [[Offering|offering]] exposure to asset classes to help mitigate portfolio [[Risk|risk]] in a way that is not possible in direct [[Equity|equity]] investments like [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds. The performance of managed [[Futures|futures]] tends to be weakly or inversely correlated with traditional [[Stock|stock]] and bond markets, making them ideal investments to round out a portfolio constructed according to [[modern portfolio theory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp).

## Understanding [[Managed Futures]]

[[Managed Futures|Managed futures]] have increasingly been positioned as an alternative to traditional [[hedge funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp). Funds and other institutional investors often use [[Hedge Fund|hedge fund]] investments as a way of diversifying their traditional investment portfolios of large market cap [[Stocks|stocks]] and highly rated bonds. One of the reasons [[Hedge|hedge]] funds were an ideal [[Diversification|diversification]] play is that they are active in the [[Futures|futures]] market. Managed futures have developed in this space to [[Offer|offer]] a cleaner diversification play for these institutional investors.

## The Rise of [[Managed Futures]]

[[Managed Futures|Managed futures]] evolved out of the Commodity [[Futures]] Trading [[Commission]] Act, which helped to define the role of [[commodity trading advisors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cta.asp) (CTA) and [[commodity pool operators]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpo.asp) (CPO). These professional money managers differed from [[Stock|stock]] market fund managers because they worked regularly with derivatives in a way most money managers did not.

The Commodity [[Futures]] and Trading [[Commission]] (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) regulate CTAs and CPOs, conducting audits and ensuring that they meet quarterly reporting requirements. The heavy regulation of the industry is another reason these investment products have gained favor with institutional investors over [[Hedge|hedge]] funds.

## How [[Managed Futures]] Trade

[[Managed Futures|Managed futures]] can have various weights in [[Stocks|stocks]] and [[derivative investments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp). A diversified managed [[Futures|futures]] account [[Will|will]] generally have exposure to a number of markets such as commodities, energy, agriculture, and currency. Most managed futures accounts will have a stated trading program that describes its market approach. Two common approaches are the market-[[Neutral|neutral]] strategy and the trend-following strategy.

### Market-[[Neutral]] Strategy

Market-[[Neutral|neutral]] strategies look to profit from [[spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp) and [[arbitrage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp) created by mispricing. Investors who employ this strategy frequently look to mitigate market [[Risk|risk]] by taking matching long and short positions in a particular industry in an attempt to achieve profit from both increasing and decreasing prices.

### Trend-Following Strategy

[Trend-following strategies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendtrading.asp) look to profit by going long or short according to [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] and/or technical market signals. When an asset's price is trending lower, trend traders may decide to enter into a short position on that asset. Conversely, when an asset is trending upward, trend traders may enter into a long position. The goal is to capture gains by analyzing various indicators, determining an asset's direction, and then executing an appropriate trade.

Investors looking into [[Managed Futures|managed futures]] can request disclosure documents that [[Will|will]] outline the trading strategy, the annualized rate of [[Return|return]], and other performance measures.
