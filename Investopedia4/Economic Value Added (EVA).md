[[Economic Value Added (EVA)]]
## What Is [[Economic Value Added (EVA)]]?

[[Economic Value Added (EVA)|Economic value added (EVA)]] is a measure of a company's [[financial performance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialperformance.asp) based on the residual wealth calculated by deducting its [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] from its [[Operating Profit|operating profit]], adjusted for taxes on a cash basis. EVA can also be referred to as [[economic profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicprofit.asp), as it attempts to capture the true economic profit of a company. This measure was devised by management consulting firm Stern Value Management, originally incorporated as Stern Stewart & Co.1

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Economic Value Added (EVA)|Economic value added (EVA)]], also known as economic profit, aims to calculate the true economic profit of a company.
-   EVA is used to measure the value a company generates from funds invested in it.
-   However, EVA relies heavily on invested capital and is best used for asset-rich companies, where companies with intangible assets, such as technology businesses, may not be good candidates.

## Understanding [[Economic Value Added (EVA)]]

EVA is the incremental difference in the [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) (RoR) over a company's [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]]. Essentially, it is used to measure the value a company generates from funds invested in it. If a company's EVA is negative, it means the company is not generating value from the funds invested into the business. Conversely, a positive EVA shows a company is producing value from the funds invested in it.

The formula for calculating EVA is:

EVA = NOPAT - (Invested Capital \* WACC)

Where:

-   [[NOPAT]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nopat.asp) = Net [[Operating Profit|operating profit]] after taxes
-   [[Invested capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invested-capital.asp) = [[Debt]] + capital leases + sharholders' [[Equity|equity]]
-   [[WACC]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) = [[Weighted]] average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]]

## Special Considerations

The equation for EVA shows that there are three key components to a company's EVA—NOPAT, the amount of capital invested, and the WACC. NOPAT can be calculated manually but is normally [[Listed|listed]] in a [[public company's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp) financials.

Capital invested is the amount of money used to fund a company or a specific project. WACC is the average rate of [[Return|return]] a company expects to pay its investors; the weights are derived as a fraction of each financial source in a company's [[capital structure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp). WACC can also be calculated but is normally provided.

The equation used for invested capital in EVA is usually total assets minus current liabilities—two figures easily found on a firm's balance sheet. In this case, the modified formula for EVA is NOPAT - (total assets - current liabilities) \* WACC.

The goal of EVA is to quantify the cost of investing capital into a certain project or firm and then assess whether it generates enough cash to be considered a good investment. A positive EVA shows a project is generating returns in excess of the required minimum [[Return|return]]. As noted by Stern Value Management, "In 1983 we developed the [[Economic Value]] Added metric to measure value that companies generate."

## Advantages and Disadvantages of EVA

EVA assesses the performance of a company and its management through the idea that a business is only profitable when it creates wealth and returns for [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp), thus requiring performance above a company's [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]].

EVA as a performance indicator is very useful. The calculation shows how and where a company created wealth, through the inclusion of [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) items. This forces managers to be aware of assets and expenses when making managerial decisions.

However, the EVA calculation relies heavily on the amount of [[invested capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invested-capital.asp) and is best used for asset-rich companies that are stable or mature. Companies with [[intangible assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp), such as technology businesses, may not be good candidates for an EVA evaluation.
