[[Vertical Spread Definition]]
## What Is a Vertical Spread?

A vertical spread involves the simultaneous buying and selling of [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) of the same type (i.e., either puts or calls) and expiry, but at different [[strike prices]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp). The term 'vertical' comes from the position of the strike prices.

This is in contrast to a horizontal, or [[calendar spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calendarspread.asp), which is the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same option type with the same strike price, but with different [[expiration dates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A vertical spread is an options strategy that involves buying (selling) a call (put) and simultaneously selling (buying) another call (put) at a different strike price, but with the same expiration.
-   Bull vertical spreads increase in value when the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset rises, while bear vertical spreads profit from a decline in price.
-   Vertical spreads limit both [[Risk|risk]] and the potential for [[Return|return]].

## Understanding Vertical Spreads

[Traders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) [[Will|will]] use a vertical spread when they expect a moderate move in the price of the [[underlying asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-asset.asp). Vertical spreads are mainly directional plays and can be tailored to reflect the trader's view, bearish or bullish, on the underlying asset.

Depending on the type of vertical spread deployed, the trader's account can either be credited or debited. Since a vertical spread involves both a purchase and a sale, the proceeds from [[writing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp) an option [[Will|will]] partially, or even fully, offset the [[Premium|premium]] required to purchase the other leg of this strategy, namely buying the option. The result is often a lower cost, lower [[Risk|risk]] trade than a [[naked options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedoption.asp) position.

However, in [[Return|return]] for lower [[Risk|risk]], a vertical spread strategy [[Will|will]] cap the profit potential as well. If an investor expects a substantial, [[trend-like]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trending-market.asp) move in the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset then a vertical spread is not an appropriate strategy.

## Types of Vertical Spreads

There are several varieties of vertical spreads.

### Bulls

Bullish traders [[Will|will]] use [[bull call spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullcallspread.asp) and [[bull put spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullputspread.asp). For both strategies, the trader buys the option with the lower strike price and sells the options with the higher strike price. Aside from the difference in the option types, the main variation is in the timing of the [[cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp). The bull call spread results in a net debit, while the bull put spread results in a net credit at the outset.

### Bears

Bearish traders utilize [[bear call spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearcallspread.asp) or [[bear put spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearputspread.asp). For these strategies, the trader sells the option with the lower strike price and buys the option with the higher strike price. Here, the bear put spread results in a net debit, while the bear call spread results in a net credit to the trader's account.

## Calculating Vertical Spread Profit and Loss

All examples do not include [[commissions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Commission|commission]].asp).

**Bull call spread**: (premiums result in a net debit)

-   Max profit = the spread between the strike prices - net [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp) paid.
-   Max loss = net [[Premium|premium]] paid.
-   Breakeven point = long call's strike price + net [[Premium|premium]] paid.

**Bear call spread**: (premiums result in a net credit)

-   Max profit = net [[Premium|premium]] received.
-   Max loss = the spread between the strike prices - net [[Premium|premium]] received.
-   Breakeven point = short call's strike price + net [[Premium|premium]] received.

**Bull put spread**: (premiums result in a net credit)

-   Max profit = net [[Premium|premium]] received.
-   Max loss = the spread between the strike prices - net [[Premium|premium]] received.
-   Breakeven point = short put's strike price - net [[Premium|premium]] received.

**Bear put spread**: (premiums result in a net debit)

-   Max profit = the spread between the strike prices - net [[Premium|premium]] paid.
-   Max loss = net [[Premium|premium]] paid.
-   Breakeven point = [[Long Put|long put]]'s strike price - net [[Premium|premium]] paid.

## Real-World Example of a Bull Vertical Spread

An investor looking to bet on a [[Stock|stock]] moving higher may embark on a bull vertical call spread. The investor buys an option on Company ABC, whose stock is trading at $50 per share. The investor buys an [[in the money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp) (ITM) option with a strike price of $45 for $4 and sells an [[out of the money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp) (OTM) call with a strike price of $55 for $3.

At expiration, Company ABC’s [[Stock|stock]] trades at $49. In this case, the investor would exercise their call, paying $45 and then selling for $49, netting a $4 profit. The call they sold expires worthless.

The $4 profit from the [[Stock|stock]] sale, plus the $3 [[Premium|premium]] and less the $4 premium paid, leaves a net profit of $3 for the spread.
