[[Judgment Definition]]
## What Is Judgment?

Judgment is a court decision, spelled out in a court order, that adjudicates a dispute between two parties by determining the rights and obligations of each party.

### Key Takeaways

-   Judgment is a court decision that settles a dispute between two parties by determining the rights and obligations of each party.
-   Judgments are classified as "_in personam_," "_in rem_," or "_quasi in rem_."
-   Judgments are usually monetary, but can also be non-monetary, and are legally enforceable.

## Understanding Judgment

Judgments are classified as:

-   _In personam_ is the most common type of judgment that holds one entity personally liable to another.
-   _In rem_ imposes a general [[Liability|liability]] over a thing, such as property, but no personal liability.
-   _Quasi in rem_ determines the rights of an individual, rather than all parties, in a particular thing, such as property.

Judgments are usually monetary, but can also be non-monetary.

-   **Monetary judgment:** If someone has been harmed in some way, they [[Will|will]] seek to resolve the dispute in court and collect damages by filing a lawsuit. The resulting court judgment orders the loser of that lawsuit to pay the winner a specified sum of money.
-   **Non-monetary judgment:** A contractor may be forced to complete a job rather than settle the dispute by paying money.

Most of the time, a judgment [[Will|will]] be for a sum of money because money is the most appropriate form of compensation for the harm. A judgment, paid or unpaid, will remain on the [[Debtor|debtor]]'s [[credit report]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp) for seven years, but it will have a worse effect on their [[credit score]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) if it is unpaid.

For the winner of a lawsuit, a court judgment is only the first step in getting the money they are owed. Actually collecting the money from the [[debtor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debtor|debtor]].asp) can be a long, arduous, and not always successful, process. However, judgments are legally enforceable. So, if the debtor does not voluntarily pay the judgment, the [[Creditor|creditor]] can take steps such as conducting a debtor's examination, seizing bank accounts, putting a [[lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp) on the debtor's property, or hiring a [[Debt|debt]] collector.

For example, if a borrower does not repay a [[Loan|loan]] or a [[credit card debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-[[Debt|debt]].asp), the [[Lender|lender]] or [[Creditor|creditor]] can obtain a judgment to force the borrower to pay. As another example, a [[landlord]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/landlord.asp) who evicted a tenant for not paying the rent might file a lawsuit to collect the unpaid rent, and if the landlord won the lawsuit, it would result in a judgment against the tenant.
