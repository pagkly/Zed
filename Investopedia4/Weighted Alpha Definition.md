## What Is [[Weighted]] Alpha?

[[Weighted]] alpha measures the performance of a [[Security|security]] over a certain period, usually a year, with more importance given to recent activity.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Weighted]] alpha measures the performance of a [[Security|security]] over a certain period, usually a year, with more importance given to recent activity.
-   A positive [[Weighted|weighted]] alpha shows that the [[Security|security]] produced a [[Return|return]] greater than the benchmark, a negative measure indicates the converse, and one to zero implies that the security had returns on par with the benchmark.
-   [[Weighted]] alpha can identify companies that have shown a strong trend over the past year and, more specifically, companies whose [[Momentum|momentum]] is building.

## Understanding [[Weighted]] Alpha

As implied in the name, [[Weighted|weighted]] alpha is a [[weighted]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weighted.asp) measure of how much a [[Security|security]], say a [[Stock|stock]], has risen or fallen over a defined period, usually a year. Generally, more emphasis is placed on recent activity by assigning higher weights to later performance measurements than those assigned to earlier measurements. This helps to give a [[Return|return]] figure that has a greater focus on the most current period, which should prove to be more relevant when analyzing that security. This metric is quite popular with [[technical analysts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analyst.asp) and those who tend to rely on analytics to augment their trading decision.

[[Weighted]] alpha uses weighted mathematical calculations to arrive at an [[alpha]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp) performance figure. Alpha is a measure of [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted performance relative to a benchmark. In the field of [[asset management]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetmanagement.asp), alpha is often thought of as a proxy for the fund manager's skill. That reasoning can also be valid when analyzing a [[Stock|stock]], which is, in part, a reflection of the effectiveness of a firm's management team.

For example, a [[Stock|stock]] that had returns on par with the benchmark, adjusted for the level of [[Risk|risk]] assumed, has an alpha of zero. A positive alpha shows that the stock produced a [[Return|return]] greater than the benchmark, while a negative alpha indicates the converse.

## [[Weighted]] Alpha Calculation

[[Weighted]] calculations give an assigned weight based on various factors. Indexes use weighting to give higher weight to securities by price or market cap. In a weighted alpha calculation, higher weight is typically given to more recent time period returns over a time series.

[[Weighted]] alpha calculations usually focus on one year of a [[security’s]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) [[Return|return]]. In general, if a security has a positive weighted alpha, an investor can assume its price has been gaining over the past year. Adversely, if a security’s price has a negative weighted alpha, investors can assume that the one-year price return is lower.

[[Weighted]] Alpha\=∑(W×α)nwhere:W\=weight assigned to each data pointα\=alphan\=number of days in defined time series\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Weighted Alpha} = \\frac { \\sum ( W \\times \\alpha ) }{ n } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &W = \\text{weight assigned to each data point} \\\\ &\\alpha = \\text{alpha} \\\\ &n = \\text{number of days in defined time series} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

In a [[Weighted|weighted]] alpha calculation, weights can vary based on preferences or [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] software programs. Some weighted alpha calculations may assign weights by quartiles, while others use a standard decreasing weight methodology.

## [[Weighted]] Alpha Inferences

[[Weighted]] alpha is used by a variety of investors. Most commonly technical analysts [[Will|will]] use weighted alpha as an indicator for supporting buy and sell signals. Technical analysts use this measure to identify companies that have shown a strong trend over the past year and, more specifically, to focus their attention on companies whose [[Momentum|momentum]] is building. When weighted alpha is positive, it can support a bullish buy signal. When weighted alpha is negative, it can support a bearish sell signal.

As an example, consider a [[Stock|stock]] that has experienced several highs and lows over the last year through both bullish and bearish trending patterns. A technical analyst using a [[Bollinger Band]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp) channel may see that the price is approaching its support trendline. If the stock has a positive [[Weighted|weighted]] alpha it can be an affirmation that the stock’s price has largely been gaining over the last year, supporting another [[bullish]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp) push higher.

In another scenario, a trader may see a [[Stock|stock]]’s price reaching and beginning to exceed its resistance band in a Bollinger Band channel. Often this is a signal of a [[Reversal|reversal]] and would indicate a sell signal. However, if this [[Security|security]] has a positive [[Weighted|weighted]] alpha it is more likely to break beyond its resistance level and move higher. Therefore, the weighted alpha could support a buy trade in this scenario.
