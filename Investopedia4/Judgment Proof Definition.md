[[Judgment Proof Definition]]
## What Is Judgment Proof?

Judgment proof is a description of a person who does not have enough assets for a [[creditor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) to seize when a court order requires [[Debt|debt]] repayment. A [[debtor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debtor|debtor]].asp) who is broke and unemployed can be considered judgment proof, as can a debtor who only has certain legally protected types of assets or income.

Being judgment proof, also called “collection proof,” is not permanent. [[Judgments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/judgement.asp) can be valid for many years, and creditors can continue to try to collect what the judgment allows long after they win a lawsuit against a [[delinquent]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delinquent.asp) borrower.

### Key Takeaways

-   If a person is deemed judgment proof, it likely means that they have no assets and no job.
-   Creditors cannot seize the assets of someone who the court names judgment proof. 
-   [[Social Security|Social security]], disability, and [[Unemployment|unemployment]] benefits do not count as assets that can be taken by creditors.
-   Judgments are valid for many years and can be renewed if they expire.

## Understanding Judgment Proof

In general, two criteria are used to identify a person as judgment proof. The first one is the absence of proper [[income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp). An individual who is unemployed or working a low-paying job that pays [[minimum wage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp) and earns enough to barely survive may fit into this category.

The second is the absence of [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp), such as bank accounts or real [[Estate|estate]] that can be used as [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp) by creditors. Income earned from the government, including [[Social Security|social security]], [[Unemployment|unemployment]] benefits, and disability, is exempt from collection by [[Creditor|creditor]] agencies.

When a person is deemed judgment proof, creditors are unable to collect any money they owe. This status is considered temporary until the individual is able to earn a proper income.

Most lawyers advise debtors not to respond to [[debt collectors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]]-collector.asp) if they believe they are judgment proof. This way, the company or agency responsible for recovering money owed on delinquent accounts receives a [[default judgment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Default|default]]-judgment.asp).

State laws determine the assets and amount of wages that cannot be collected despite a judgment.

## Example of Judgement Proof

Suppose a person—call him Mike—becomes too sick to work and uses a [[credit card]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp) to pay his living expenses and medical bills for a year. He recovers from his illness and goes back to work, but he can’t afford to repay the [[Debt|debt]] he accumulated. The credit card company fails in its debt collection efforts, then sells Mike’s unpaid debt to a [[collection agency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collectionagency.asp).

The [[Collection Agency|collection agency]] contacts Mike repeatedly, but he doesn’t pay them anything; he’s struggling to hang onto his house, buy groceries, and keep the lights on. As a last resort, the collection agency sues Mike and obtains a judgment against him for the unpaid [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp). The agency now has a court order requiring Mike to repay a sum the court has determined to be valid.

However, because Mike barely earns more than the minimum wage, his wages can’t be [[garnished]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/[[Garnishment|garnishment]].asp), and because he lives in a state that protects his primary residence from creditors, the [[Collection Agency|collection agency]] can’t place a [[lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp) on his house. Mike has no money in the bank, and he doesn’t own a car or any other assets that can be seized and sold to repay his [[Debt|debt]]. Mike is currently judgment proof.

If Mike’s financial circumstances improve next year and he starts earning significantly more, the [[Collection Agency|collection agency]] might then be able to garnish a percentage of his wages to start recouping what it is owed. Because judgments can remain valid for a long time and be renewed once they expire, creditors may be able to collect on Mike's [[Debt|debt]] many years down the road.
