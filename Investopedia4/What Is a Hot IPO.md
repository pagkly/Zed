[[What Is a Hot IPO]]?
## [[What Is a Hot IPO]]?

A hot IPO is an [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) of [[Equity|equity]] in a company that appeals to many investors and for which there is an elevated demand for its [[Stock|stock]].

There are other ways to go public other than an IPO, including a direct listing or direct public [[Offering|offering]]. When a company starts the IPO process, a specific set of events take place facilitated by chosen bank underwriters.

### Key Takeaways

-   An IPO is an initial public [[Offering|offering]] of [[Equity|equity]] in a company; a hot IPO is one that garners great interest and investor demand.
-   A private company looking to go public [[Will|will]] bring in one or more banks to underwrite the issuance and handle the pricing, marketing, and decisions about the number of [[Shares|shares]] and share price range.
-   With a hot IPO, the demand for [[Shares|shares]] surpasses the initial [[Supply|supply]] of shares, and the price range needs to be revised upward.
-   If a hot IPO is underpriced, it [[Will|will]] likely see its [[Stock|stock]] price rise after the [[Shares|shares]] begin trading; if it is overpriced, the stock price will likely drop.

## Understanding a Hot IPO

Companies that opt to issue [[Stock|stock]] via an IPO can raise a substantial amount of money in a short time, particularly if the issuance attracts public attention and becomes a hot IPO. An initial public [[Offering|offering]] gives a private company a chance to cash in on the public’s demand for its [[Shares|shares]].

When a company decides to make such an [[Offering|offering]], it typically finds one or more investment banks to [[underwrite]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp) the issuance and make arrangements to sell [[Shares|shares]] on public [[Stock|stock]] exchanges. The underwriters market the IPO as they help the company set a per-share price. The underwriting banks [[Will|will]] assume a specific number of shares, which they will [[Offer|offer]] to their buyers, and collect a portion of the sale proceeds as a fee. These buyers may be institutional or retail clients. The part they receive is the [[underwriting spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwritingspread.asp).

## [[Oversubscribed]] Hot IPO

Hot IPOs appeal to investors who anticipate that the demand for [[Shares|shares]] [[Will|will]] outstrip the number of shares offered. IPOs with more demand than [[Supply|supply]] are considered [oversubscribed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/[[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]].asp), making them a target for short-term speculators as well as those who see a long-term opportunity in holding the [[Equity|equity]].

Also, increased demand for the [[Shares|shares]] [[Will|will]] lead to a sharp rise in the price of the [[Stock|stock]] soon after it begins trading. Usually, this sudden increase in share price is not sustainable.

Because a hot IPO is likely to be [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]], companies [[Will|will]] often permit their underwriters to increase the size of the [[Offering|offering]] to accommodate more investors and make more money. The trick for underwriters lies in balancing the size of the IPO with the appropriate price for the amount of interest in the [[Shares|shares]]. When done correctly, this balancing will maximize profit for the company and its underwriter banks.

If a hot IPO is an [underpriced](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underpricing.asp) issue, it [[Will|will]] usually see a rapid rise in price after the [[Shares|shares]] hit the market and the market adjusts to the high demand for the [[Stock|stock]]. Conversely, overpricing the IPO can lead to a rapid fall in prices, even though the higher price benefits the underwriting bank issuing the stock since it only makes money on the initial issue.

Initial shareholders are significantly affected by sharp moves in price after trading opens to the general public. Underwriters sometimes give preferential treatment to high-value clients when [[Offering|offering]] [[Shares|shares]] in a hot IPO, so they bear some [[Risk|risk]] if they overprice the [[Stock|stock]]. However, a hot IPO does not provide a guaranteed win for investors. Sometimes the hype of an upcoming IPO does not bear the planned fruit for the investor.

## Facebook IPO as a Cautionary Tale

Such was the case when social giant Facebook announced its plans to go public. In early 2012, analysts indicated that the long-awaited Facebook IPO, seeking to raise about $10.6 billion by selling more than 337 million [[Shares|shares]] at $28 to $35 per share, could generate such significant interest from investors. These analysts predicted an [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] IPO.

At the market opening on May 18, 2012, as predicted, investor interest showed there was more demand for Facebook [[Shares|shares]] than the company was [[Offering|offering]]. To take advantage of the [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] IPO and fulfill investor demand, Facebook increased the number of shares to 421 million but also raised the price range to $34 to $38 per share.

In effect, Facebook and its underwriters raised both the [[Supply|supply]] and price of [[Shares|shares]] to meet demand and diminish the securities oversubscription. However, it quickly became clear that Facebook was not [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] at its IPO price, as the [[Stock|stock]] fell precipitously in its first four months of trading. The stock failed to trade above its IPO price until July 31, 2013.
