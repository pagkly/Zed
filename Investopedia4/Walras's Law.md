[[Walras's Law]]
## What Is [[Walras's Law]]?

[[Walras's Law|Walras's law]] is an economic theory, which states that the existence of excess [[supply]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Supply|supply]].asp) in one market must be matched by excess [[demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp) in another market so that both factors are balanced out. Walras's law asserts that an examined market must be in equilibrium if all other markets are in equilibrium. [[Keynesian economics]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp), by contrast, assumes that one market can be out of balance without a "matching" imbalance elsewhere.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Walras's Law|Walras's law]] implies that, for any excess demand oversupply for a single good, a corresponding excess [[Supply|supply]] over demand exists for at least one other good, which is the state of market equilibrium.
-   [[Walras's Law|Walras's law]] is based on equilibrium theory, which states that all markets must be "cleared" of any excess [[Supply|supply]] and demand to be in equilibrium.
-   Keynesian economic theory stands in contrast to [[Walras's Law|Walras's law]], by stating one market can be in imbalance without another market being out of balance.
-   [[Walras's Law|Walras's law]] works on the principle of the invisible hand; where there is excess demand, the invisible hand [[Will|will]] raise prices, and where there is excess [[Supply|supply]], the invisible hand will decrease prices, until equilibrium is reached.
-   Critics claim that it is difficult to quantify utility, which influences demand, making [[Walras's Law|Walras's law]] difficult to formulate as a mathematical equation.

## Understanding [[Walras's Law]]

[[Walras's Law|Walras's law]] is named after French [[economist]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp) LÃ©on Walras (1834 - 1910), who created [[general equilibrium theory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-equilibrium-theory.asp) and founded the Lausanne School of [[Economics|economics]]. Walras's famous insights can be found in the book _Elements of Pure Economics_, published in 1874. Walras, along with William Jevons and Carl Menger, were considered founding fathers of [[Define Neoclassical Economics|neoclassical economics]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neoclassical.asp).1

[[Walras's Law|Walras's law]] assumes that the [[invisible hand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblehand.asp) is at work to settle markets into equilibrium. Where there is excess demand, the invisible hand [[Will|will]] raise prices; where there is excess [[Supply|supply]], the hand will lower prices for consumers to drive markets into a state of balance.

[Producers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/producer_surplus.asp), for their part, [[Will|will]] respond rationally to changes in [[interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp). If rates rise they will reduce production and if they fall they will invest more in [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] facilities. Walras predicated all of these theoretical dynamics upon the assumptions that consumers pursue self-interests and that firms try to maximize profits.

## Limitations of [[Walras's Law]]

In practice, observations have not matched Walras's theory in many cases. Even if "all other markets" were in equilibrium, an excess of [[Supply|supply]] or demand in an observed market meant that it was not in equilibrium. [[Walras's Law|Walras's law]] looks at markets as a whole rather than individually.

Economists who studied and built on [[Walras's Law|Walras's law]] hypothesized that the challenge of quantifying units of so-called "[utility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utility.asp)," a subjective concept, made it difficult to formulate the law in mathematical equations, which Walras sought to do. Measuring utility for each individual, not to mention aggregating across a population to form a utility function, was not a practical exercise, critics of Walras's law argued. According to them, if this could not be done, the law would not [[Hold|hold]], because utility influences demand.
