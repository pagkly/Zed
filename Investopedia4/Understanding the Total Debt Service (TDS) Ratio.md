[[Understanding the Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio]]
## What Is the Total [[Debt Service]] (TDS) Ratio?

The term total [[Debt Service|debt service]] (TDS) ratio refers to a [[debt service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtservice.asp) measurement that financial lenders use when determining the proportion of [[gross income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp) that is already spent on housing-related and other similar payments. Lenders consider each potential borrower’s property taxes, credit card balances, and other monthly [[Debt|debt]] obligations to calculate the ratio of income to debt, and then compare that number to the [[Lender|lender]]’s [[benchmark]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) for deciding whether or not to extend credit.

## How the Total [[Debt Service]] (TDS) Ratio Works

A total [[Debt Service|debt service]] (TDS) ratio helps lenders determine whether a borrower can manage monthly payments and repay the money they borrow. When applying for a [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp)—or any other type of [[Loan|loan]]—lenders look at what percentage of a borrower's [[income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp) would be spent on the mortgage payment, real [[Estate|estate]] taxes, [[homeowners insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp), association dues, and other obligations.

Lenders also determine what portion of an applicant's income is already used for paying [[credit card]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp) balances, student loans, [[alimony]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alimony-payment.asp) and child support, auto loans, and other debts that appear on a borrower's [[credit report]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp). A stable income, timely bill payment, and a strong [[Credit Score|credit score]] are not the only factors in being extended a mortgage.

Borrowers with higher TDS ratios are more likely to struggle to meet their [[Debt|debt]] obligations than borrowers with lower ratios. Because of this, most [[lenders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) do not give qualified mortgages to borrowers with TDS ratios that exceed 43%. They increasingly prefer a ratio of 36% or less for [[Loan|loan]] approval instead.

### Key Takeaways

-   The total [[Debt Service|debt service]] ratio is a lending metric used by mortgage lenders to assess a borrower's capacity to take on a [[Loan|loan]].
-   The total [[Debt Service|debt service]] ratio, unlike the gross [[Debt|debt]] service ratio, includes housing and non-housing-related debts and obligations.
-   A TDS ratio below 43% is typically necessary to obtain a mortgage, with many lenders adopting more strict levels.

## Special Considerations

Remember, there are other factors that lenders take into consideration when determining whether to advance credit to certain borrowers. For instance, a small [[Lender|lender]] that holds less than $2 billion in [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) in the previous year and provides 500 or fewer mortgages in the past 12 months may [[Offer|offer]] a [[Qualified Mortgage|qualified mortgage]] to a borrower with a TDS ratio exceeding 43%.

Lenders typically prefer borrowers who have a total [[Debt Service|debt service]] ratio of 36%.

Credit histories and [[credit scores]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) are among those factors. People with higher credit scores tend to manage their debts more responsibly by holding a reasonable amount of [[Debt|debt]], making payments on time, and keeping [[account balances]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountbalance.asp) low.

In addition to higher credit scores, larger lenders may provide mortgages to borrowers who have larger savings and down payment amounts if those factors demonstrate the borrower can reasonably [[repay]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ability-to-repay.asp) the [[Loan|loan]] on time. Lenders may also consider granting additional [[credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp) to borrowers with whom they have long-standing relationships.

## Total [[Debt Service]] (TDS) Ratio vs. Gross [[Debt]] Service Ratio

Although the TDS ratio is very similar to the [[gross debt service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossdebtserviceratio.asp) (GDS) ratio, an applicant's GDS does not account for non-housing related payments such as credit card debts or car loans. As such, the gross [[Debt Service|debt service]] ratio may also be referred to as the [housing expense ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_expense_ratio.asp). Borrowers should generally strive for a gross [[Debt|debt]] service ratio of 28% or less. You may also hear GDS and TDS referred to as Housing 1 and Housing 2 ratios respectively.

In practice, the gross [[Debt Service|debt service]] ratio, total [[Debt|debt]] service ratio, and a borrower’s [[Credit Score|credit score]] are the key components analyzed in the [[underwriting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp) process for a mortgage [[loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Loan|loan]].asp). GDS may be used in other personal loan calculations as well, but it is most commonly used in the mortgage lending process.

## Example of Total [[Debt Service]] (TDS) Ratio

Determining a TDS ratio involves adding up monthly [[Debt|debt]] [[obligations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp) and dividing them by gross monthly income. Here's a hypothetical example to show how it works. Let's assume an individual with a gross monthly income of $11,000 also has monthly payments that are:

-   $2,225 for a mortgage
-   $1,000 for a [[student loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/student-loans-4689727)
-   $350 for a motorcycle [[Loan|loan]]
-   $650 for a credit card balance

The total is $4,225:

$2,225+$1,000+$350+$650\=$4,225\\begin{aligned} &\\$2,225 + \\$1,000 + \\$350 + \\$650 = \\$4,225 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Therefore, the TDS ratio is approximately 38%:

($4,225$11,000)×100\=38.4\\begin{aligned} &\\left ( \\frac{ \\$4,225 }{ \\$11,000 } \\right ) \\times 100 = 38.4 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Because the ratio is below 43% and not much higher than 36%, the individual would most likely [[qualify for a mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-[[Estate|estate]]/08/mortgage-candidate.asp).
