[[What Is a Equity Risk Premium]]?
## What Is [[Equity]] [[Risk]] [[Premium]]?

The term [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] refers to an excess [[Return|return]] that investing in the [[stock market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp) provides over a risk-free rate. This excess [[return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp) compensates investors for taking on the relatively higher risk of equity investing. The size of the premium varies and depends on the [[level of risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-profile.asp) in a particular [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. It also changes over time as market risk fluctuates.

### Key Takeaways

-   An [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] is an excess [[Return|return]] earned by an investor when they invest in the [[Stock|stock]] market over a risk-free rate.
-   This [[Return|return]] compensates investors for taking on the higher [[Risk|risk]] of [[Equity|equity]] investing.
-   Determining an [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] is theoretical because there's no way to tell how well equities or the [[Equity Market|equity market]] [[Will|will]] perform in the future.
-   Calculating an [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] requires using historical rates of [[Return|return]].

## How [[Equity]] [[Risk]] Premiums Work

[[Stocks]] are generally considered [[high-risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0512/low-vs.-high-[[Risk|risk]]-investments-for-beginners.aspx) investments. Investing in the [[Stock|stock]] market comes with certain risks, but it also has the potential for big rewards. So, as a rule, investors are compensated with higher [[premiums]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp) when they invest in the stock market. Whatever [[Return|return]] you earn above a risk-free investment such as U.S. [[Treasury bill]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp) (T-bill) or a bond is called an [[Equity|equity]] risk premium.

An [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] is based on the idea of the risk-reward tradeoff. It is a forward-looking figure and, as such, the premium is theoretical. But there's no real way to tell just how much an investor [[Will|will]] make since no one can actually say how well [[equities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) or the [[equity market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equitymarket.asp) will perform in the future. Instead, an equity risk premium is an estimation as a backward-looking metric. It observes the [[Stock|stock]] market and government [[bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) performance over a defined period of time and uses that historical performance to the potential for future returns. The estimates vary wildly depending on the time frame and method of calculation.

Because [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] premiums require the use of [[Historical Returns|historical returns]], they aren't an exact science and, therefore, aren't completely accurate.

To calculate the [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]], we can begin with the [[capital asset pricing model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp) (CAPM), which is usually written as **Ra = Rf + βa (Rm - Rf),** where:

-   Ra = expected [[Return|return]] on investment in **a** or an [[Equity|equity]] investment of some kind
-   Rf = [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]]
-   βa = [[beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) of **a**
-   Rm = expected [[Return|return]] of the [[market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp)

So, the equation for [[Equity|equity]] [[risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]].asp) [[Premium|premium]] is a simple reworking of the CAPM which can be written as: **Equity Risk Premium = Ra - Rf = βa (Rm - Rf)**

If we are simply talking about the [[Stock|stock]] market (a = m), then Ra = Rm. The beta coefficient is a measure of a stock's [[Volatility|volatility]]—or [[Risk|risk]]—versus that of the market. The market's [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) is conventionally set to 1, so if a = m, then βa = βm = 1. Rm - Rf is known as the [[market premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketriskpremium.asp), and Ra - Rf is the risk [[Premium|premium]]. If _a_ is an [[Equity|equity]] investment, then Ra - Rf is the equity risk premium. If a = m, then the market premium and the equity risk premium are the same.

According to some [[economists]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp), this isn't a generalizable concept even though certain markets in certain time periods may display a considerable [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]]. They argue that too much focus on specific cases has made a statistical peculiarity seem like an economic law. Several [[Stock|stock]] exchanges have gone bust over the years, so a focus on the historically exceptional U.S. market may distort the picture. This focus is known as [[survivorship bias]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/survivorshipbias.asp).

The majority of economists agree, though that the concept of an [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] is valid. Over the [[Long Term|long term]], markets compensate [[investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) more for taking on the greater risk of investing in [[Stocks|stocks]]. How exactly to calculate this premium is disputed. A survey of academic economists gives an average range of 3% to 3.5% for a one-year horizon, and 5% to 5.5% for a 30-year horizon. [[Chief financial officers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfo.asp) (CFOs) estimate the premium to be 5.6% over T-bills. The second half of the 20th century saw a relatively high equity risk premium, over 8% by some calculations, versus just under 5% for the first half of the century. Given that the century ended at the height of the [[dotcom bubble]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp), however, this arbitrary window may not be ideal.

## Special Considerations

The equation noted above summarizes the theory behind the [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]], but it doesn't account for all possible scenarios. The calculation is fairly straightforward if you plug in historical rates of [[Return|return]] and use them to estimate future rates. But how do you estimate the expected rate of return if you want to make a [[forward-looking]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forward-looking.asp) statement?

One method is to use dividends to estimate long-term growth, using a reworking of the [[Gordon Growth Model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp): **k = D / P + g**

where:

-   k = expected [[Return|return]] expressed as a percentage (this could be calculated for Ra or Rm)
-   D = dividends per share
-   P = price per share
-   g = annual growth in dividends expressed as a percentage

Another is to use growth in earnings, rather than growth in dividends. In this model, the expected [[Return|return]] is equal to the earnings [[Yield|yield]], the reciprocal of the [[price-to-earnings ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) (P/E ratio): **k = E / P**

where:

-   k = expected [[Return|return]]
-   E = trailing twelve-month [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS)
-   P = price per share

The drawback of both of these models is that they do not account for [[valuation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp). That is, they assume the [[Stocks|stocks]]' prices never correct. Since we can observe [[Stock|stock]] market [[booms and busts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boom-and-bust-cycle.asp) in the past, this drawback is not insignificant. 

Finally, the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]] is usually calculated using U.S. government bonds, since they have a negligible chance of [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp). This can mean T-bills or T-bonds. To arrive at a real rate of return, that is, adjusted for inflation, it is easiest to use [Treasury inflation-protected securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp) (TIPS), as these already account for [[inflation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp). It is also important to note that none of these equations account for tax rates, which can dramatically alter returns.
