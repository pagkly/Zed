[[Monetary Base]]
## What Is a [[Monetary Base]]

A [[Monetary Base|monetary base]] is the total amount of a currency that is either in general circulation in the hands of the public or in the commercial [[bank deposits]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-deposits.asp) held in the central bank's reserves. This measure of the [[money supply]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp) typically only includes the most liquid currencies; it is also known as the "money base."

## Understanding Monetary Bases

The [[Monetary Base|monetary base]] is a component of a nation’s money [[Supply|supply]]. It refers strictly to highly liquid funds including notes, coinage and current bank deposits. When the Federal Reserve creates new funds to purchase bonds from commercial banks, the banks see an increase in their [[Holdings|holdings]], which causes the monetary base to expand.

For example, country [[Z]] has 600 million currency units circulating in the public and its [[central bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) has 10 billion currency units in reserve as part of deposits from many commercial banks. In this case, the [[Monetary Base|monetary base]] for country Z is 10.6 billion currency units.

As of June 2016, the U.S. had a [[Monetary Base|monetary base]] of almost $3.9 trillion. 

## [[Monetary Base]] and the Money [[Supply]]

The money [[Supply|supply]] expands beyond the [[Monetary Base|monetary base]] to include other assets that may be less liquid in form. It is most commonly divided into levels, [[Listed|listed]] as M0 through [[M3]] or M4 depending on the system, with each representing a different facet of a nation’s assets. The monetary base’s funds are generally held within the lower levels of the money supply, such as [[M1]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m1.asp) or M2, which encompasses cash in circulation and specific liquid assets including, but not limited to, savings and checking accounts.

To qualify, the funds must be considered a final settlement of a transaction. For example, if a person uses cash to pay a [[Debt|debt]], that transaction is final. Additionally, writing a check against money in a [[Checking Account|checking account]], or using a debit card, can also be considered final since the transaction is backed by actual cash deposits once they have cleared.

In contrast, the use of credit to pay a [[Debt|debt]] does not qualify as part of the [[Monetary Base|monetary base]], as this is not the final step to the transaction. This is due to the fact the use of credit just transfers a debt owed from one party, the person or business receiving the credit-based payment and the credit issuer.

## Managing Monetary Bases

Most monetary bases are controlled by one national institution, usually a country's central bank. They can usually change the [[Monetary Base|monetary base]] (either expanding or contracting) through open market operations or monetary policies. 

For many countries, the government can maintain a measure of control over the [[Monetary Base|monetary base]] by buying and selling [[government bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp) in the open market.

## Smaller Scale Monetary Bases and Money Supplies

At the household level, the [[Monetary Base|monetary base]] consists of all notes and coins in the possession of the household, as well as any funds in deposit accounts. The money [[Supply|supply]] of a household may be extended to include any available credit open on credit cards, unused portions of lines of credit and other accessible funds that translate into a [[Debt|debt]] that must be repaid.
