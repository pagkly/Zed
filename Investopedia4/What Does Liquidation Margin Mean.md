[[What Does Liquidation Margin Mean]]?
## What Is a Liquidation Margin?

The liquidation margin is the value of all of the positions in a [[margin account]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp). These can include both [[long and short positions]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-long-and-short-position-market.asp).

Because margin accounts are subject to [[margin calls]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp), the current liquidation margin is a significant concern for both margin traders and their [[brokers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp). If the liquidation margin becomes insufficient to support the trader's positions, the broker may [[Liquidate|liquidate]] those positions to reduce their [[Risk|risk]].

### Key Takeaways

-   A liquidation margin is the current value of a margin account based on its cash deposits and the most recent market value of its open positions.
-   If traders allow their liquidation margins to become too low, they may be faced with margin calls from their brokers.
-   Traders can increase their liquidation margins by depositing additional cash in their accounts. Other forms of [[Collateral|collateral]] may also be used.

## Understanding Liquidation Margins

Margin trading is the practice of borrowing money from a broker to execute [[leveraged]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp) transactions. When buying securities, this leveraged trading consists of borrowing cash from the broker and using it to purchase securities. When engaging in [[short selling]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp), leveraged trading involves borrowing the securities themselves from the broker's inventory. The leveraged short seller then sells those securities and seeks to repurchase them at a lower price in the future.

When using margin, a trader must be careful to ensure that the total value of the margin account does not drop below a certain level. The value of the account, which is based on market prices, is known as the liquidation margin.

To illustrate, consider a scenario where a trader makes a series of leveraged [[Stock|stock]] purchases. Suppose those purchases begin to generate losses. Then, the liquidation margin of the account [[Will|will]] start to decline. If the decline continues, it will eventually reach the point where the broker has the right to initiate a [[Margin Call|margin call]].

A [[Margin Call|margin call]] would effectively force the trader to provide additional [[Collateral|collateral]] for the account to reduce its [[Risk|risk]] level. Typically, this collateral consists of depositing more cash in the brokerage account. This cash becomes part of the liquidation margin, raising the margin level above the required threshold.

## Types of Liquidation Margins

If an investor or trader holds a [[long position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp), the liquidation margin is equal to what the investor or trader would retain if the position were closed. If a trader has a [[short position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp), the liquidation margin is equal to what the trader would owe to purchase the [[Security|security]].

## Example of a Liquidation Margin

Sarah is a margin trader who invested her entire $10,000 in a single [[Stock|stock]] using 100% [[Leverage|leverage]]. For simplicity, assume that Sarah already paid the required [[margin interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/margin_interest.asp). She now has control of $20,000 worth of stock. However, the initial liquidation margin is only $10,000. $10,000 is what Sarah would receive if the account were closed.

Suppose that Sarah's [[Stock|stock]] performed poorly and fell 25%. Since Sarah was initially using 2:1 [[Leverage|leverage]], that means she lost 50% of her original investment. Sarah's account now has a liquidation margin of just $5,000, but she commands $15,000 worth of stock. At this point, a more conservative brokerage might become concerned and make a [[Margin Call|margin call]].
