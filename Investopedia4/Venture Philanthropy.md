## Understanding [[Venture Philanthropy]]

[[Venture Philanthropy|Venture philanthropy]] applies most of the same principles of venture capital funding to invest in start-up, growth or [[Risk|risk]]-taking social ventures. It is not explicitly interested in profit but rather in making investments which promote some sort of social good. It is an umbrella term that can be used to refer shorthand to many different kinds of philanthropic investing, but notably, it is distinct from [[impact investing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/impact-investing.asp), which places more emphasis on turning a profit while nevertheless investing in ventures that address social concerns.

## Special Considerations: Origins of [[Venture Philanthropy]]

The term was originally coined by John D. Rockefeller III in 1969, who described it as "an adventurous approach to funding unpopular social causes." The Rockefeller Foundation remains a leading outlet for socially-attuned investing. [[Venture Philanthropy|Venture philanthropy]] arose largely as a result of a growing public impression that traditional financing mechanisms (investments, government or university grants, etc.) rarely assisted non-profit organizations or other socially beneficial industries build capital.

[[Venture Philanthropy|Venture philanthropy]] showed an increase as awareness of climate change and environmental degradation rose to the forefront of public concern. However, it has shown showing signs of ceding dominance in the [[philanthropic investment sphere to impact investing]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/060915/impact-investing-vs-venture-philanthropy.asp), which is concerned with making a profit while being socially responsible. Cap-and-trade emissions markets or subsidies granted to sustainably-operating businesses have attempted to bridge the gap between the market's drive for profit and the philanthropic concern for socially responsible business practices.
