[[Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)]]
## What Is a Unit Linked Insurance Plan?

A [[Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)|unit linked insurance plan (ULIP)]] is a multi-faceted product issued by insurance companies that combine insurance coverage and investment exposure in a single [[Offering|offering]]. This product requires policyholders to make regular [[Premium|premium]] payments, part of which are utilized to provide insurance coverage, while the remaining portions are pooled with assets from other policyholders, then invested in [[Equity|equity]] and [[Debt|debt]] instruments, much like mutual funds.

## Understanding Unit Linked Insurance Plans

A unit linked insurance plan can be utilized for various benefit payouts, including life insurance, retirement income, and education expenses. In most cases, an investor opens a ULIP to [[Offer|offer]] these types of provisions to his or her beneficiaries. With a life insurance ULIP, the beneficiary would receive payments following the owner’s death.

A unit linked insurance plan’s investment options are structured similar to that of mutual funds, in that they pool investments with those from other investors. As such, a ULIP's assets are managed with an eye towards accomplishing a specified investment objective. Investors can buy [[Shares|shares]] in a single strategy or diversify their investments across multiple market-linked ULIP funds.

Policyholders must commit an initial lump sum payment when they first buy into a ULIP, followed by annual, semi-annual, or monthly [[Premium|premium]] payments. Although the premium payment obligations vary from product to product, in all cases, they are proportionally invested towards a designated investment mandate. But ULIPs are unique in that they [[Offer|offer]] flexibility to investors, who may adjust their fund preferences throughout the duration of their investment. For example, depending on their investment needs, they can shuttle between [[Stock|stock]] funds, bond funds, and diversified funds.
