[[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity]]
## What Is a [[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity]]?

A [[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity|joint life with last survivor annuity]] is an insurance product that provides an income for life to both partners in a marriage.

It also can allow for payments to a designated [[Third Party|third party]] or [[beneficiary]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp) even after the death of one of the spouses or partners. Aside from providing an income that cannot be outlived—essentially longevity insurance—it also may be used as a way to leave a financial legacy to a beneficiary or a charitable cause.

A [[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity|joint life with last survivor annuity]] may also be referred to as a [[joint and survivor annuity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointandsurvivorannuity.asp). An [[annuity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuity.asp) is a financial product that provides a set income stream, typically used by retirees.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity|joint life with last survivor annuity]] is an insurance product for a couple that provides regular payments as long as one spouse is still living.
-   The amount of the payment is determined in the individual contract and is based on the needs of the couple.
-   After the first partner dies, the payment is typically adjusted lower for the surviving partner.
-   This type of annuity can also allow for payments to go to a [[Third Party|third party]] or beneficiary even after both of the original partners have passed away.

## Understanding [[Joint]] Life With Last Survivor Annuities

A [[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity|joint life with last survivor annuity]] is, by definition, not term certain. Payments continue until both partners in a marriage die. Typically, after one partner dies, the survivor receives a smaller payment. The exact amounts to be paid are specified in the contract.

It is also possible for an annuitant to designate a beneficiary, who may or may not be the same person as the designated third-party. That third-party would receive a payment that is triggered by the death of one of the spouses.

For example, a couple might have a [[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity|joint life with last survivor annuity]] that pays a $2,000 monthly benefit. After one spouse dies, half of that $2,000 may be reallocated to a third-party beneficiary, such as a child, for the life of the remaining spouse.

As such, a [[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity|joint life with last survivor annuity]] may be used as a component of [[estate planning]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp).

A [[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity|joint life with last survivor annuity]] is sometimes called a [[Joint and Survivor Annuity|joint and survivor annuity]].

## Suitability Considerations

A [[Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity|joint life with last survivor annuity]] is for married couples who want a surviving party to continue receiving benefits until the death of both individuals. Annuity buyers, in this case, [[Will|will]] need to decide how much the surviving spouse will need financially.

Common options provide for payouts at 100% of the original benefit, 75%, 66.66%, or 50%. Since a surviving spouse's living costs tend to be higher than half the living costs of two people, many financial advisors and planners choose an income payment above 50%.

It should be noted that lower payments generally mean a higher death benefit. Of course, if there are other sources of income in retirement, a 50% [[Payout|payout]] may be adequate.
