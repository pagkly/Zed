[[Personal Property]]
## What is [[Personal Property]]?

[[Personal Property|Personal property]] is a class of property that can include any asset other than real [[Estate|estate]]. The distinguishing factor between personal property and [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp), or [[Real Property|real property]], is that personal property is movable; that is, it isn't fixed permanently to one particular location. It is generally not [[taxed like fixed property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/propertytax.asp).

## Understanding [[Personal Property]]

[[Personal Property|Personal property]] is also known as movable property, movables, and chattels. Because it is viewed as an asset, it may be taken into consideration by a [[Lender|lender]] when someone applies for a mortgage or other [[Loan|loan]]. 

[[Personal Property|Personal property]] can be insured for its current, possibly depreciated, value or for what it would cost to replace with a similar new item.

Some kinds of property, such as home appliances, clothing, and automobiles, tend to depreciate in value over time. Other kinds, such as artworks and antiques, [[Will|will]] sometimes appreciate in value. When assessing a would-be borrower's [[creditworthiness]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp), lenders may look at the total current value of their [[Personal Property|personal property]] added to their [[Real Property|real property]].

### Key Takeaways

-   Loans can be secured by [[Personal Property|personal property]] (artwork or automobile) or [[Real Property|real property]] (house).
-   [[Personal Property|Personal property]] plays a role when people insure a home.
-   A common example is a car [[Loan|loan]], for which the car itself serves as [[Collateral|collateral]].

What is [[Real Property|real property]] vs. [[Personal Property|personal property]]? Real property—such as land or most kinds of buildings—is not movable. Examples of [[Tangible Personal Property|tangible personal property]] include vehicles, furniture, boats, and collectibles. Personal property can be intangible, as in the case of [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds.

Just as some loans—mortgages, for example—are secured by [[Real Property|real property]], such as a house, some loans are secured by [[Personal Property|personal property]].

## Example of [[Personal Property]] and Insurance

[[Personal Property|Personal property]] also comes into play when people insure their homes. A [[homeowner's insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp) policy typically covers not just the physical dwelling but also the owner's personal property, often referred to as the home's "contents."

Most homeowners policies base the value of the policyholder's [[Personal Property|personal property]] on a percentage of the dwelling's value, typically 50% to 70%. For example, if a home would cost $200,000 to rebuild if it burned to the ground, the policy might use 70% of that figure, or $140,000, as the coverage limit for the owner's personal property.

Homeowners policyholders can typically choose between two options for covering their [[Personal Property|personal property]]: replacement value or actual cash value. If the policy provides for replacement value, the insurer would be obligated to replace a destroyed item with a similar new item. With actual cash value, the insurer is only expected to pay what the item was worth, after taking depreciation into account.

So, for example, if a refrigerator were destroyed in a house fire, a homeowner with a 10-year-old refrigerator and replacement coverage should receive enough money to buy a new refrigerator, while a homeowner with actual cost coverage would receive whatever the insurance company determined a used 10-year-old refrigerator to be worth.

## Special Considerations

In the event that their [[Personal Property|personal property]] is destroyed, policyholders must file a claim with their insurance company, describing what they lost. For that reason, homeowners are well-advised to make an inventory of their personal property, ideally with photos and receipts, and store it safely off-premises, just in case it's ever needed.

Homeowners policies also limits coverage for certain types of [[Personal Property|personal property]], such as jewelry and computers. For example, a policy may limit its coverage of jewelry to $1,500. Policyholders whose jewelry is worth more than that can pay extra to raise the limits in their policy or buy additional insurance, often called a [[floater]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floaterinsurance.asp), to cover its full value.
