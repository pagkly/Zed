[[Tag-Along Rights Definition]]
## What are Tag-Along Rights?

Tag-along rights also referred to as "co-sale rights," are contractual obligations used to protect a minority shareholder, usually in a [[venture capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp) deal. If a majority shareholder sells his stake, it gives the minority shareholder the right to join the transaction and sell their minority stake in the company. Tag-alongs effectively oblige the majority shareholder to include the [[Holdings|holdings]] of the minority holder in the negotiations so that the tag-along right is exercised.

### Key Takeaways

-   Tag-along rights are contractual obligations to protect a minority investor in a startup or company.
-   Tag-along rights are mainly used to ensure that the stake of minority stakeholders is considered during a company sale.
-   They ensure greater [[Liquidity|liquidity]] for minority shareholders.
-   The minority investors are entitled to the same price and conditions as the majority investor when the [[Shares|shares]] are sold.

## Understanding Tag-Along Rights

Tag-along rights are pre-negotiated rights that a minority shareholder includes in their initial issuance of a company's [[Stock|stock]]. These rights allow a minority shareholder to sell their share if a majority shareholder is negotiating a sale for their stake. Tag-along rights are prevalent in startup companies and other private firms with considerable [[Upside|upside]] potential.

Tag-along rights give minority shareholders the ability to capitalize on a deal that a larger shareholder — often a financial institution with considerable pull — puts together. Large shareholders, such as venture capital firms, often have a greater ability to source buyers and negotiate payment terms. Tag-along rights, therefore, provide minority shareholders with greater [[Liquidity|liquidity]]. Private [[Equity|equity]] [[Shares|shares]] are incredibly hard to sell, but majority shareholders can often facilitate purchases and sales on the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp).

## Example of Tag-Along Rights

Co-founders, angel investors, and venture capital firms often rely on tag-along rights. For example, let's assume that three co-founders launch a tech company. The business is going well, and the co-founders believe that they have proved the concept enough to scale. The co-founders then seek outside investment in the form of a seed round. A private [[Equity|equity]] angel investor sees the value of the company and offers to purchase 60% of it, requiring a large amount of equity to compensate for the [[Risk|risk]] of investing in the small company. The co-founders accept the investment, making the angel investor the largest shareholder.

The investor is tech-focused and has significant relationships with some of the larger, public technology companies. The startup co-founders know this and, therefore, negotiate tag-along rights in their investment agreement. The business grows consistently over the next three years, and the angel investor, happy with their [[investment return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) on paper, looks for a buyer of their [[Equity|equity]] among the major tech companies.

The investor finds a buyer who wants to purchase the entire 60% stake for $30 a share. The tag-along rights negotiated by the three co-founders gives them the ability to include their [[Equity|equity]] [[Shares|shares]] in the sale. The minority investors are entitled to the same price and terms as the majority investor. Thus, the three co-founders, using their rights, effectively sell their shares for $30 each.
