Why the Price/Earnings-to-Growth Ratio Matters
## What Is the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio?

The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a [[Stock|stock]]'s [[price-to-earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock's value while also factoring in the company's expected earnings growth, and it is thought to provide a more complete picture than the more standard P/E ratio.

### Key Takeaways

-   The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding in expected earnings growth into the calculation.
-   The PEG ratio is considered to be an indicator of a [[Stock|stock]]'s true value, and similar to the P/E ratio, a lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued.
-   The PEG for a given company may differ significantly from one reported source to another, depending on which growth estimate is used in the calculation, such as one-year or three-year projected growth.

## How to Calculate the PEG Ratio

PEG Ratio\=Price/EPSEPS Growthwhere:EPS = The earnings per share\\begin{aligned} &\\text{PEG Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{Price/EPS}}{\\text{EPS Growth}}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{EPS = The earnings per share}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

To calculate the [[PEG ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/what-considered-good-peg-price-earnings-growth-ratio.asp), an investor or analyst needs to either look up or calculate the P/E ratio of the company in question. The P/E ratio is calculated as the price per share of the company divided by the [[Earnings Per Share (EPS)|earnings per share (EPS)]], or price per share / EPS.

Once the P/E is calculated, find the expected growth rate for the [[Stock|stock]] in question, using analyst estimates available on financial websites that follow the stock. Plug the figures into the equation, and solve for the PEG ratio number.

### Accuracy

As with any ratio, the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used. When considering a company's PEG ratio from a published source, it's important to find out which growth rate was used in the calculation. Yahoo! [[Finance]], for example, calculates PEG using a P/E ratio based on current-year data and a five-year expected growth rate.1

Using historical [[Growth Rates|growth rates]], for example, may provide an inaccurate PEG ratio if future growth rates are expected to deviate from a company's historical growth. The ratio can be calculated using one-year, three-year, or five-year expected growth rates, for example.

To distinguish between calculation methods using future growth and historical growth, the terms "forward PEG" and "trailing PEG" are sometimes used.

## What Does the Price/Earnings-to-Growth Ratio Tell You?

While a low [[P/E ratio may make a stock look like a good buy]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/043002.asp), factoring in the company's growth rate to [[get the stock's PEG ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/use-pe-ratio-and-peg-to-tell-[[Stocks|stocks]]-future/) may tell a different story. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the [[Stock|stock]] may be undervalued given its future earnings expectations. Adding a company's expected growth into the ratio helps to adjust the result for companies that may have a high growth rate and a high P/E ratio.

The degree to which a PEG ratio result indicates an over or underpriced [[Stock|stock]] varies by industry and by company type. As a broad [[Rule Of Thumb|rule of thumb]], some investors feel that a PEG ratio below one is desirable.

According to well-known investor Peter Lynch, a company's P/E and expected growth should be equal, which denotes a fairly valued company and supports a PEG ratio of 1.0. When a company's PEG exceeds 1.0, it's considered overvalued while a [[Stock|stock]] with a PEG of less than 1.0 is considered undervalued.2

## Example of How to Use the PEG Ratio

The PEG ratio provides useful information to compare companies and see which [[Stock|stock]] might be the better choice for an investor's needs, as follows.

Assume the following data for two hypothetical companies, Company A and Company B:

### Company A:

-   Price per share = $46
-   EPS this year = $2.09
-   EPS last year = $1.74

### Company B

-   Price per share = $80
-   EPS this year = $2.67
-   EPS last year = $1.78

Given this information, the following data can be calculated for each company.

### Company A

-   P/E ratio = $46 / $2.09 = 22
-   Earnings growth rate = ($2.09 / $1.74) - 1 = 20%
-   PEG ratio = 22 / 20 = 1.1

### Company B

-   P/E ratio = $80 / $2.67 = 30
-   Earnings growth rate = ($2.67 / $1.78) - 1 = 50%
-   PEG ratio = 30 / 50 = 0.6

Many investors may look at Company A and find it more attractive since it has a lower P/E ratio between the two companies. But compared to Company B, it doesn't have a high enough growth rate to justify its P/E. Company B is trading at a discount to its growth rate and investors purchasing it are paying less per unit of earnings growth.
