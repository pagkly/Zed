[[Tax-Equivalent Yield]]
## What Is the [[Tax-Equivalent Yield]]?

The [[Tax-Equivalent Yield|tax-equivalent yield]] is the [[Return|return]] that a [taxable bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxablebond.asp) would need to equal the [yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/[[Yield|yield]].asp) on a comparable tax-exempt [municipal bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp). The calculation is a tool that investors can use to compare the returns between a tax-free investment and a taxable alternative.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Tax-Equivalent Yield|tax-equivalent yield]] is the [[Return|return]] that a taxable bond would need to [[Yield|yield]] in order to equal the yield on a comparable tax-exempt bond, such as a municipal bond.
-   The calculation is a tool that investors can use to compare the returns between a tax-free investment and a taxable alternative.
-   Tax implications, in general, are a complicated and important part of any financial strategy, as well as an often overlooked part.

## Understanding [[Tax-Equivalent Yield]]

Tax implications, in general, are a complicated and important part of any financial strategy, as well as an often overlooked part. The [[Tax-Equivalent Yield|tax-equivalent yield]] calculation is a useful tool for investors, especially those in higher tax brackets. The tax-equivalent [[Yield|yield]] is the yield on a taxable bond that an investor would have to earn to match the [[Return|return]] on a comparable tax-free municipal bond. Municipal bonds generally have a low expected return, so the full impact of investing in them due to tax savings is often not quantified completely. The calculation helps an investor to decide whether to select a taxable investment or a tax-free investment, such as a tax-free municipal bond. This information is crucial because the tax-free advantage that municipal bonds [[Offer|offer]] can be hard to match with other investments. 

However, it is not the end of the story. Some additional tax considerations can come into play when making such a comparison. While municipal bonds are free of federal taxes, some states do tax the earnings. The [[Liquidity|liquidity]] of municipal bonds may also be limited.

## [[Tax-Equivalent Yield]] Formula

Depending on an investor's tax bracket, a municipal bond may not be the best investment decision for their [portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp). An investor's tax bracket [[Will|will]] depend on their filing status and income. The federal income tax brackets for 2020 and 2021 are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.1

To calculate the taxable equivalent [[Yield|yield]] of a tax-free municipal bond, use the following formula and be sure to include any state taxes along with your federal tax rate.

-   ReturnTEY = ReturnTX ÷ (1 – t)

Where:

-   ReturnTEY: [[Return]] on fully taxable equivalent [[Yield|yield]]
-   ReturnTX: [[Return]] on tax exempt investment
-   t: Investor's marginal tax rate

This formula can be reversed to determine the tax-free equivalent [[Yield|yield]] of a municipal bond that would match the [[Return|return]] on a taxable bond.

## Example of [[Tax-Equivalent Yield]] Formula Calculations

An investor's tax rate plays a significant role in the resulting tax-equivalent yields. For example, assume there is a tax-free bond that is yielding 7%. A decision to invest in this particular bond or any of the many taxable choices available greatly depends on the investor's marginal tax bracket. In the United States, as of 2020, there are seven different marginal tax-rate brackets: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, and 35%. The [[Tax-Equivalent Yield|tax-equivalent yield]] calculations for these brackets are as follows:

-   10% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 10%) = 7.78%
-   12% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 12%) = 7.95%
-   22% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 22%) = 8.97%
-   24% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 24%) = 9.21%
-   32% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 32%) = 10.29%
-   35% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 35%) = 10.77%
-   37% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 37%) = 11.11%

Given this information, assume there is a taxable bond that is yielding 9.75%. In this situation, investors in the first four marginal tax brackets would be better off investing in the taxable bond, because even after paying their [[Tax Liability|tax liability]], they would still earn more than a 7% non-taxable bond. Investors in the highest three brackets would be better off investing in the tax-free bond. Note, however, that none of this is investment advice, a tax or financial advisor should be consulted.

## Example of [[Tax-Equivalent Yield]]

An investor in the 22% federal income [tax bracket](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxbracket.asp), and no state taxes, owns a tax-exempt municipal bond with an 8% [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]]. To calculate the fully taxable equivalent [[Yield|yield]] that a taxable bond would have to earn to match the municipal bond's yield, use the above formula.

-   ReturnTEY = 0.08 ÷ (1 – 0.22) = 10.26%

In other words, a taxable bond would have to earn an equivalent [[Yield|yield]] of 10.26%, where after taxes are deducted it would match the 8% [[Return|return]] of the tax-free municipal bond.

If the marginal tax rate is higher, the required fully taxable equivalent [[Yield|yield]] [[Will|will]] also be higher than 10.26%. So, if all else remains the same, with the only difference being that the investor is in the 37% tax bracket, the fully taxable equivalent yield would have to be:

-   ReturnTEY = 0.08 ÷ (1 - 0.37) = 12.70%

## Special Considerations

### Why Are Municipal Bonds Tax-Exempt?

Interest earned on state and local bonds has been tax-exempt since the introduction of the [[federal income tax]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal_income_tax.asp) in 1913. Initially, this was because many people felt the Constitution prevented the federal government from taxing this income. Since then, the justification for tax exclusion has been supported by the idea that local infrastructure projects serve the common good, and therefore, federal tax policy should support those projects.2

Municipal bonds are not always tax-free. Federal taxes may apply to a municipal bond if the [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) does not interpret a project as good for the entire public. [Taxable municipal bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxable-municipal-bond.asp) are rare, but they can be issued for projects such as a sports stadium or a pension [[Shortfall|shortfall]]. The IRS can also treat municipal interest income as taxable if a bond is purchased at a significant discount to [par value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp).3

A mutual fund composed of tax-free bonds is still subject to [capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp).4
