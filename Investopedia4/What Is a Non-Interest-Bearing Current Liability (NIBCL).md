## [[What Is a Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liability (NIBCL)]]?

A non-interest-bearing current [[Liability|liability]] (NIBCL) is a category of expenses that an individual or a company must pay off within the calendar year but [[Will|will]] not owe interest on. Taxes that do not include late penalties as well as accounts payable are examples of NIBCLs that can be found on a company's balance sheet.

NIBCLs are [[Listed|listed]] on a balance sheet under the liabilities column, in the [[current liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp) section.

## Understanding NIBCL

Non-interest-bearing current liabilities are relatively straightforward. Interest-bearing current  
liabilities, such as working capital loans or the current portion due on a long-term [[Debt|debt]], can be more complicated.

### Key Takeaways

-   A non-interest bearing current [[Liability|liability]] is an item in a corporate balance sheet that reflects short-term expenses and debts that are not accruing interest.
-   Corporate balance sheets distinguish between obligations to pay debts with interest and obligations to pay ordinary expenses such as account receivables.
-   In either case, these are obligations due in one year or less.

In addition to non-interest-bearing current liabilities, a balance sheet may list non-interest-bearing non-current liabilities. This indicates a [[Debt|debt]] that must be paid more than a year in the future but is not accruing interest.

Non-interest-bearing liabilities that are not due for payment until a later period are [[Listed|listed]] separately.

A large number of non-interest-bearing non-current liabilities in a balance sheet is considered to be a warning sign that a company is piling up expenses that it may have trouble paying down the road.

### NIBCL for Regular People

Individuals, as well as corporations, have non-interest-bearing current liabilities.

If a person made up a balance sheet that looked like a corporate financial document, costs such as rent and utilities would go under NIBCL. A mortgage or car payment, however, would be an interest-bearing [[Liability|liability]].

Non-interest-bearing consumer [[Debt|debt]] is all too rare, but a consumer with a good introductory deal on a credit card would be able to record the current balance on the card as a NIBCL.

It would be relatively rare for a consumer to have a non-interest bearing non-current [[Liability|liability]]. However, someone who leased a new car or furnished a home using one of those no-payment-for-90-days deals might log the future payments as non-interest-bearing non-current liabilities.

### One Oddity in NIBCL

A bond or a note may be an NIBCL if it bears no interest. That is, some investments in [[Debt|debt]] pay no interest but are sold at a discount to their face values. The investor's profit comes with the [[Return|return]] of the original investment at its full face value when the note reaches maturity.

## Example of NIBCL

The Kroger Co. owns a wide range of familiar store names such as Dillons, Pay-Less Supermarkets, and Ralph's as well as the Kroger stores. It [[Listed|listed]] the following under Current Liabilities on its balance sheet:

1.  Current portion of long-term [[Debt|debt]] including obligations under capital leases and financing obligations
2.  Trade accounts payable
3.  Accrued salaries and wages
4.  Deferred income taxes
5.  Other non-interest-bearing liabilities, which are typically not broken down in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
