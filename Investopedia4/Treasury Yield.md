[[Treasury Yield]]
## What Is the [[Treasury Yield]]?

[[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]] is the [[Return|return]] on investment, expressed as a percentage, on the U.S. government's [[Debt|debt]] obligations. Looked at another way, the Treasury [[Yield|yield]] is the effective [[interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) that the U.S. government pays to borrow money for different lengths of time.

Treasury yields don't just influence how much the government pays to borrow and how much investors earn by buying government bonds. They also influence the interest rates that individuals and businesses pay to borrow money to buy real [[Estate|estate]], vehicles, and equipment. Treasury yields also tell us how investors feel about the economy. The higher the yields on long-term U.S. Treasuries, the more confidence investors have in the economic outlook. But high long-term yields can also be a signal of rising inflation in the future.

#### Understanding [[Treasury Yield]]

## Understanding the [[Treasury Yield]]

When the U.S. government needs to raise capital to source projects, such as building new infrastructure, it issues [[Debt|debt]] instruments through the [[U.S. Treasury]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp). The types of debt instruments that the government issues include [[Treasury Bills (T-Bills)|Treasury bills (T-bills)]], Treasury notes (T-notes) and [[Treasury bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp) (T-bonds), which come in different maturities up to 30 years. The T-bills are short-term bonds that mature within a year, the T-notes have maturity dates of 10 years or less, and the T-bonds are long-term bonds that [[Offer|offer]] maturities of 20 and 30 years.

### key takeaways

-   The [[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]] is the interest rate that the U.S. government pays to borrow money for different lengths of time.
-   Each of the Treasury securities (T-bonds, T-bills, and T-notes) has a different [[Yield|yield]]; longer-term Treasury securities usually have a higher yield than shorter-term Treasury securities.
-   Treasury yields reflect how investors feel about the economy; the higher the yields on long-term instruments, the more optimistic their outlook.

## Factors That Drive the [[Treasury Yield]]

Treasuries are considered to be a low-[[Risk|risk]] investment because they are backed by the [[full faith and credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/full-faith-credit.asp) of the U.S. government. Investors that purchase these Treasuries [[Loan|loan]] the government money. The government, in turn, makes interest payments to these bondholders as compensation for the loan provided. The interest payments, known as [[coupons]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp), represent the cost of borrowing to the government. The rate of [[Return|return]] or [[Yield|yield]] required by investors for loaning their money to the government is determined by [[Supply|supply]] and demand.

Treasuries are issued with a [[face value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp) and a fixed interest rate and are sold at the initial auction or in the secondary market to the highest bidder.

When there is a lot of demand for the securities, the price is bid up past its face value and trades [[at a premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-a-[[Premium|premium]].asp). This lowers the [[Yield|yield]] that the investor [[Will|will]] get since the government only repays the instrument's face value on the maturity date. For example, an investor that purchases a bond for $10,090 will be repaid only the face value of $10,000 when it matures. When the [[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]] falls, lending rates for consumers and businesses also fall.

If the demand for Treasuries is low, the [[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]] increases to compensate for the lower demand. When demand is low, investors are only willing to pay an amount below par value. This increases the [[Yield|yield]] for the investor since he can purchase the bond at a discount and be repaid the full face value on the maturity date. When Treasury yield increases, interest rates in the economy also increase since the government must pay higher interest rates to attract more buyers in future auctions.

Treasury yields can go up if the [[Federal Reserve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp) increases its target for the [[federal funds rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp) (in other words, if it tightens monetary policy), or even if investors merely expect the fed funds rate to go up.

Each of the Treasury securities has a different [[Yield|yield]]. Under normal circumstances, longer-term Treasury securities have a higher yield than shorter-term Treasury securities. Since the maturities on [[Treasury bills]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp) are very short, they typically [[Offer|offer]] the lowest yield compared to the T-notes and T-bonds. As of Feb. 7, 2020, the [[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]] on a 3-month T-bill is 1.56%; the 10-year note is 1.59%, and the 30-year bond is 2.05%. The U.S. Treasury publishes the yields for all of these securities daily on its [[website]](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield).

When short-term [[Debt|debt]] interest rates become higher than long-term debt rates, the situation is characterized as an inverted [[Yield Curve|yield curve]].

## [[Yield]] on Treasury Bills

While Treasury notes and bonds [[Offer|offer]] coupon payments to bondholders, the T-bill is similar to a [[Zero-Coupon Bond|zero-coupon bond]] that has no interest payments but is issued at a discount to [[par]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/par.asp). An investor purchases the bill at a weekly auction at less than face value and redeems it at maturity for face value. In this case, the difference between the auction price and face value is the interest which can be used to calculate the [[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]]. The Treasury Department uses two methods to calculate the [[Yield|yield]] on T-bills with maturities of less than a year: the discount method and the investment method.

Under the discount [[Yield|yield]] method, the [[Return|return]] as a percent of the face value, not the purchase value, is calculated. For example, an investor that purchases a 90-day T-bill for $9,800 per $10,000 face value [[Will|will]] have a yield of:

**Discount [[Yield]] = \[($10,000 - $9,800) / $10,000\] x (360/91) = 7.91%**

Under the investment [[Yield|yield]] method, the [[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]] is calculated as a percent of the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]], not the face value. Following our example above, the yield under this method is:

**Investment [[Yield]] = \[($10,000 - $9,800) / $9,800\] x (365/91) = 8.19%**

Note that the number of days per year used under both methods is different. The discount method uses 360, which is the number of days used by banks to determine short-term interest rates. The investment [[Yield|yield]] uses the number of days of a calendar year, which is 365 or 366. Given that the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of a Treasury bill is always less than the face value, the discount method tends to understate the yield.

## [[Yield]] on Treasury Notes and Bonds

The rate of [[Return|return]] for investors holding [[Treasury notes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurynote.asp) and Treasury bonds includes the coupon payments that they receive semi-annually and the face value of the bond that they are repaid at maturity. T-notes and bonds can be purchased [[at par]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-par.asp), at a discount, or at a [[Premium|premium]], depending on the demand and [[Supply|supply]] of these securities at auction or in the secondary markets. If a Treasury is purchased at par, then its [[Yield|yield]] equals its [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]]; if at a discount, yield [[Will|will]] be higher than coupon rate and yield will be lower than coupon rate if purchased at a premium.

The formula for calculating the [[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]] on notes and bonds held to maturity is:

**[[Treasury Yield]] = \[C + ((FV - PP) / T)\] ÷ \[(FV + PP)/2\]**

where C= [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]]

FV = face value

PP = [[Purchase Price|purchase price]]

T = time to maturity  

The [[Yield|yield]] on a 10-year note with 3% coupon purchased at a [[Premium|premium]] for $10,300 and held to maturity is:

[[Treasury Yield]] = \[$300 + (($10,000 - $10,300) / 10)\] ÷ \[($10,000 + $10,300)/2\]

\= $270 / $10,150 = 2.66%

Because of their low [[Risk|risk]], Treasuries have a low [[Return|return]] compared to many other investments. Very low Treasury yields, like the ones observed in 2020 thus far, can drive investors into riskier investments, such as [[Stocks|stocks]], which have higher returns.
