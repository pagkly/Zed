[[Working Capital Loan – Definition]]
## What Is a Working Capital [[Loan]]?

A [[working capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp) [[Loan|loan]] is a loan that is taken to [[Finance|finance]] a company's everyday operations. These [[loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp) are not used to buy long-term assets or investments and are, instead, used to provide the working capital that covers a company's short-term operational needs.

Those needs can include costs such as [[Payroll|payroll]], rent, and [[Debt|debt]] payments. In this way, working capital loans are simply corporate debt borrowings that are used by a company to [[Finance|finance]] its daily operations.

### Key Takeaways

-   A working capital [[Loan|loan]] is a loan taken to [[Finance|finance]] a company's everyday operations.
-   Working capital loans are not used to buy long-term assets or investments; they are used to provide working capital to covers a company's short-term operational needs.
-   Companies with high [[Seasonality|seasonality]] or cyclical sales may rely on working capital loans to help with periods of reduced business activity.
-   Working capital loans are often tied to a business owner's personal credit, so missed payments or defaults may hurt their [[Credit Score|credit score]].

## Understanding Working Capital Loans

Sometimes a company does not have adequate cash on hand or asset [[Liquidity|liquidity]] to cover day-to-day operational expenses and, thus, [[Will|will]] secure a [[Loan|loan]] for this purpose. Companies with high [[Seasonality|seasonality]] or [[cyclical sales]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cyclical_industry.asp) may rely on working capital loans to help with periods of reduced business activity.

Many companies do not have stable or predictable revenue throughout the year. [[Manufacturing]] companies, for example, may have cyclical sales that correspond with the needs of retailers. Most retailers sell more product during the fourth quarter—that is, during the holiday season—than at any other time of the year.

To [[Supply|supply]] retailers with the proper amount of goods, manufacturers typically conduct most of their production activity during the summer months, readying inventories for the fourth quarter push. Then, when the end of the year hits, retailers reduce [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] purchases as they focus on selling through their inventory, which subsequently reduces manufacturing sales.

Manufacturers with this type of [[Seasonality|seasonality]] often require a working capital [[Loan|loan]] to pay wages and other [[operating expenses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp) during the [[Quiet Period|quiet period]] of the fourth quarter. The loan is usually repaid by the time the company hits its busy season and no longer needs the financing.

Missed payments on a working capital [[Loan|loan]] may hurt the business owner's [[Credit Score|credit score]] if the loan is tied to their personal credit.

Types of financing include a [[term loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termloan.asp), a [[business line of credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/072913/basics-lines-credit.asp), or [[invoice financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invoice-financing.asp), a form of short-term borrowing extended by a [[Lender|lender]] to its business customers based on unpaid invoices. Business credit cards, which allow you to earn rewards, can also provide access to working capital.

## Pros and Cons of Working Capital Loans

The immediate benefit of a working capital [[Loan|loan]] is that it's easy to obtain and lets business owners efficiently cover any gaps in working [[capital expenditures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp). The other noticeable benefit is that it is a form of [[debt financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtfinancing.asp) and does not require an [[Equity|equity]] transaction, meaning that a business owner maintains full control of their company, even if the financing need is dire.

Some working capital loans are [[unsecured]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp). If this is the case, a company is not required to put down any [[Collateral|collateral]] to secure the [[Loan|loan]]. However, only companies or business owners with a high [[credit rating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) are eligible for an [[Unsecured Loan|unsecured loan]]. Businesses with little to no credit have to [[securitize]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitize.asp) the loan.

A [[collateralized]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateralization.asp) working capital [[Loan|loan]] that needs asset [[Collateral|collateral]] can be a drawback to the loan process. However, there are other potential drawbacks to this type of working capital loan. Interest rates are high in order to compensate the lending institution for [[Risk|risk]]. Furthermore, working capital loans are often tied to a business owner's personal credit, and any missed payments or defaults may hurt their [[Credit Score|credit score]].
