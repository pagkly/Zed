[[Yield]]
## What Is a [[Yield]]?

[[Yield]] refers to the earnings generated and realized on an investment over a particular period of time. It's expressed as a percentage based on the invested amount, [[current market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmv.asp), or face value of the [[Security|security]]. It includes the interest earned or [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) received from holding a particular security. Depending on the valuation (fixed vs. fluctuating) of the security, yields may be classified as known or anticipated.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Yield]] is a [[Return|return]] measure for an investment over a set period of time, expressed as a percentage.
-   [[Yield]] includes price increases as well as any dividends paid, calculated as the net realized [[Return|return]] divided by the [[Principal|principal]] amount (i.e. amount invested).
-   Higher yields are perceived to be an indicator of lower [[Risk|risk]] and higher income, but a high [[Yield|yield]] may not always be a positive, such as the case of a rising dividend yield due to a falling [[Stock|stock]] price.

## Formula for [[Yield]]

[[Yield]] is a measure of [[cash flow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) that an investor gets on the amount invested in a [[Security|security]]. It is mostly computed on an annual basis, though other variations like quarterly and monthly yields are also used. Yield should not be confused with [[total return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp), which is a more comprehensive measure of [[Return|return]] on investment. Yield is calculated as:

[[Yield]] = Net Realized [[Return]] / [[Principal]] Amount

For example, the gains and [[Return|return]] on [[Stock|stock]] investments can come in two forms. First, it can be in terms of price rise, where an investor purchases a stock at $100 per share and after a year they sell it for $120. Second, the stock may pay a dividend, say of $2 per share, during the year. The [[Yield|yield]] would be the appreciation in the share price plus any dividends paid, divided by the original price of the stock. The yield for the example would be:

($20 + $2) / $100 = 0.22, or 22%

#### Introduction To Dividend Yields

## What [[Yield]] Can Tell You

Since a higher [[Yield|yield]] value indicates that an investor is able to recover higher amounts of cashflows in his investments, a higher value is often perceived as an indicator of lower [[Risk|risk]] and higher income. However, care should be taken to understand the calculations involved. A high yield may have resulted from a falling market value of the [[Security|security]], which decreases the denominator value used in the formula and increases the calculated yield value even when the security’s valuations are on a decline.

While many investors prefer dividend payments from [[Stocks|stocks]], it is also important to keep an eye on yields. If yields become too high, it may indicate that either the [[Stock|stock]] price is going down or the company is paying high dividends. Since dividends are paid from the company’s earnings, higher dividend payouts could mean the company's earnings are on the rise, which could lead to higher stock prices. Higher dividends with higher stock prices should lead to a consistent or marginal rise in [[Yield|yield]]. However, a significant rise in yield without a rise in the stock price may mean that the company is paying dividends without increasing earnings, and that may indicate near-term [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] problems.

## Types of Yields

Yields can vary based on the invested [[Security|security]], the duration of investment and the [[Return|return]] amount.

### [[Yield]] on [[Stocks]]

For [[Stock|stock]]-based investments, two types of yields are popularly used. When calculated based on the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]], the [[Yield|yield]] is called [[yield on cost (YOC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yield-on-cost.asp), or cost yield, and is calculated as:

Cost [[Yield]] = (Price Increase + Dividends Paid) / [[Purchase Price]]

In the above-cited example, the investor realized a profit of $20 ($120 - $100) resulting from price rise, and also gained $2 from a dividend paid by the company. Therefore, the cost [[Yield|yield]] comes to ($20 + $2) / $100 = 0.22, or 22%.

However, many investors may like to calculate the [[Yield|yield]] based on the current market price, instead of the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]]. This yield is referred to as the [[current yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentyield.asp) and is calculated as:

[[Current Yield]] = (Price Increase + Dividend Paid) / Current Price

In the above example, the [[Current Yield|current yield]] comes to ($20 + $2) / $120 = 0.1833, or 18.33%.

When a company's [[Stock|stock]] price increases, the [[Current Yield|current yield]] goes down because of the inverse relationship between [[Yield|yield]] and stock price. 

### [[Yield]] on Bonds

The [[Yield|yield]] on bonds that pay annual interest can be calculated in a straightforward manner—called the [[nominal yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalyield.asp), which is calculated as:

Nominal [[Yield]] = (Annual Interest Earned / Face Value of Bond)

For example, if there is a Treasury bond with a face value of $1,000 that matures in one year and pays 5% annual interest, its [[Yield|yield]] is calculated as $50 / $1,000 = 0.05, or 5%

However, the [[Yield|yield]] of a floating interest rate bond, which pays a variable interest over its tenure, [[Will|will]] change over the life of the bond depending upon the applicable interest rate at different terms.

If there is a bond that pays interest based on the 10-year [[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]] + 2% then its applicable interest [[Will|will]] be 3% when the 10-year Treasury [[Yield|yield]] is 1% and will change to 4% if the 10-year Treasury yield increases to 2% after a few months.

Similarly, the interest earned on an index-linked bond, which has its interest payments adjusted for an index, like such as the [[Consumer Price Index (CPI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp) inflation index, [[Will|will]] change as the fluctuations in the value of the index.

[Yield to maturity (YTM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldtomaturity.asp) is a special measure of the total [[Return|return]] expected on a bond each year if the bond is held until maturity. It differs from nominal [[Yield|yield]], which is usually calculated on a per-year basis and is subject to change with each passing year. On the other hand, YTM is the average yield expected per year and the value is expected to remain constant throughout the holding period until the maturity of the bond.

The [[yield to worst (YTW)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldtoworst.asp) is a measure of the lowest potential [[Yield|yield]] that can be received on a bond without the possibility of the issuer defaulting. YTW indicates the worst-case scenario on the bond by calculating the [[Return|return]] that would be received if the issuer uses provisions including prepayments, call back, or [sinking funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sinkingfund.asp). This yield forms an important [[Risk|risk]] measure and ensures that certain income requirements [[Will|will]] still be met even in the worst scenarios.

The [[yield to call (YTC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldtocall.asp) is a measure linked to a [[callable bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callablebond.asp)—a special category of bonds that can be redeemed by the issuer prior to its maturity—and YTC refers to the bond’s [[Yield|yield]] at the time of its call date. This value is determined by the bond’s interest payments, its market price and the duration until the call date as that period defines the interest amount.

[Municipal bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp), which are bonds issued by a state, municipality or county to [[Finance|finance]] its capital expenditures and are mostly non-taxable,1 also have a [[tax-equivalent yield (TEY)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxequivalentyield.asp). TEY is the pretax [[Yield|yield]] that a taxable bond needs to have for its yield to be the same as that of a tax-free municipal bond, and it is determined by the investor's [tax bracket](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxbracket.asp).2

While there are a lot of variations for calculating the different kinds of yields, a lot of liberty is enjoyed by the companies, issuers and fund managers to calculate, report and advertise the [[Yield|yield]] value as per their own conventions. Regulators like [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) have introduced a standard measure for yield calculation, called the [[SEC yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secyield.asp), which is the standard yield calculation developed by SEC and is aimed at [[Offering|offering]] a standard measure for fairer comparisons of bond funds. SEC yields are calculated after taking into consideration the required fees associated with the fund.3

[Mutual fund yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutual-fund-[[Yield|yield]].asp) is used to represent the net income [[Return|return]] of a [mutual fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) and is calculated by dividing the annual income distribution payment by the value of a mutual fund’s [[Shares|shares]]. It includes the income received through dividend and interest that was earned by the fund's [portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp) during the given year. Since mutual fund valuation changes every day based on their calculated [[net asset value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp), the mutual fund yields are also calculated and vary with the fund’s market value each day.

Along with investments, [[Yield|yield]] can also be calculated on any business venture. The calculation retains the form of how much [[Return|return]] is generated on the invested capital.
