## Understanding FANG [[Stocks]]

The term FANG [[Stocks]] was coined by CNBC's "Mad Money" host [[Jim Cramer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jimcramer.asp) in 2013.1 It is now widely used by market commentators and analysts. The stocks referred to by the acronym are all well-known and richly-valued technology companies that trade on the [[NASDAQ]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/[[Nasdaq|nasdaq]].asp) exchange, a collection of approximately 3,300 American technology companies.2 Many other companies included in the NASDAQ exchange are also viewed as [[growth investments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthinvesting.asp), although very few have matched the impressive growth of the FANG stocks in recent years.

Despite their common reputation as successful growth companies, the business models of the FANG [[Stocks|stocks]] are distinct. Facebook, for example, is the world’s preeminent [[social networking]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-networking.asp) platform. With a user-base of more than 2.5 billion people as of Aug. 2020, the company can claim approximately 30% of the world's population as its customers.3 To monetize this extraordinary user base, Facebook sells ads that are targeted based on users’ personal preferences and usage patterns.

Amazon, meanwhile, is a leading [[business to consumer (B2C)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp) e-[[Commerce|commerce]] platform that uses leading-edge [[cloud computing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cloud-computing.asp) and [[data analytics]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-analytics.asp) technologies to sell a retail catalog. Although Amazon initially pioneered the sale of books online, books now represent only about one-third of their overall product catalog. In 2020, the company had sold products to over 300 million active customers in the U.S. alone, with half of those customers opting to subscribe to its paid membership service, [[Amazon Prime]](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/8-lesser-known-benefits-amazon-prime/).4

Netflix is also known for its impressive customer growth. An online entertainment [[streaming service]](https://www.investopedia.com/the-streaming-tv-wars-are-heating-up-fast-4771386) specializing in movies and television shows, the company's subscriber base has grown exponentially in recent years, from 22 million in 2011 to more than 190 million in 2020.5 To compete with [[new entrants]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrierstoentry.asp) to the streaming market, Netflix has also begun aggressively producing its own exclusive content, moving beyond its traditional role as a content aggregator to a major content producer in its own right.

Alphabet has leveraged its core expertise as the world’s foremost search engine, developing a highly profitable online advertising business while driving user retention through popular web applications such as YouTube, Google Docs, and Google Maps. The company receives an average of over 60,000 search requests every second of every day, and its mobile operating system, [[Android]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/android-operating-system.asp), has gained an estimated 75% share of the global [[smartphone market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smartphone.asp).

## Example of FANG [[Stocks]]

With these impressive facts in mind, it is no wonder why investors have been enthusiastic about the FANG [[Stocks]]' business prospects. In recent years, this enthusiasm has been supported by the companies' financial performance, which has caused substantial increases in their respective [[Stock|stock]] prices.

In the [[trailing twelve months (TTM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) as of August 2020, for example, Facebook has reported [[revenues]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp) of over $75 billion, and [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) of over $23 billion.6 Amazon, meanwhile, showed revenue of an astounding $321 billion, producing net income of $13 billion.7 Over the past five years, these two companies’ [[Stock|stock]] prices increased by roughly 215% and 560%, respectively.89

Netflix and Google have also shown strong TTM performance, with Netflix posting revenues of over $22 billion and net income of over $2.6 billion.10 Google, for its part, generated $166 billion in revenues along with nearly $31 billion in net income.11 Buoyed by these earnings, Netflix’s [[Stock|stock]] rose by 355% in the past five years, while Google's rose by about 158% over the same timeframe.1213
