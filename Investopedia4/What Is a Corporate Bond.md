[[What Is a Corporate Bond]]?
## [[What Is a Corporate Bond]]?

A corporate bond is a type of [[Debt|debt]] [[Security|security]] that is issued by a firm and sold to investors. The company gets the capital it needs and in [[Return|return]] the investor is paid a pre-established number of interest payments at either a fixed or variable interest rate. When the bond expires, or "reaches maturity," the payments cease and the original investment is returned.

The backing for the bond is generally the ability of the company to repay, which depends on its prospects for future revenues and profitability. In some cases, the company's physical assets may be used as [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A corporate bond is [[Debt|debt]] issued by a company in order for it to raise capital.
-   An investor who buys a corporate bond is effectively lending money to the company in [[Return|return]] for a series of interest payments, but these bonds may also actively trade on the secondary market.
-   Corporate bonds are typically seen as somewhat riskier than U.S. government bonds, so they usually have higher interest rates to compensate for this additional [[Risk|risk]].
-   The highest quality (and safest, lower yielding) bonds are commonly referred to as "Triple-A" bonds, while the least creditworthy are termed "junk".

## Understanding Corporate Bonds

In the investment hierarchy, high-quality corporate bonds are considered a relatively safe and conservative investment. Investors building balanced portfolios often add bonds in order to offset riskier investments such as growth [[Stocks|stocks]]. Over a lifetime, these investors tend to add more bonds and fewer risky investments in order to safeguard their accumulated capital. Retirees often invest a larger portion of their assets in bonds in order to establish a reliable income supplement.

In general, corporate bonds are considered to have a higher [[Risk|risk]] than U.S. [[government bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp). As a result, interest rates are almost always higher on corporate bonds, even for companies with top-flight [[credit quality]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp). The difference between the yields on highly-rated corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries is called the [[credit spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditspread.asp).

## Corporate Bond Ratings

Before being issued to investors, bonds are reviewed for the [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]] of the issuer by one or more of [[three U.S. rating agencies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-[[Rating|rating]]-agencies.asp): Standard & Poor's Global Ratings, Moody's Investor Services, and [[Fitch Ratings]].1 2 3 Each has its own ranking system, but the highest-rated bonds are commonly referred to as "[Triple-A](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aaa.asp)" rated bonds. The lowest rated corporate bonds are called high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds due to their greater interest rate applied to compensate for their higher [[Risk|risk]]. These are also known as ["junk" bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp).

Bond ratings are vital to alerting investors to the quality and stability of the bond in question. These ratings consequently greatly influence interest rates, investment appetite, and bond pricing.

## How Corporate Bonds Are Sold

Corporate bonds are issued in blocks of $1,000 in face or par value. Almost all have a standard coupon payment structure. Typically a corporate issuer [[Will|will]] enlist the help of an investment bank to underwrite and market the bond [[Offering|offering]] to investors.

The investor receives regular interest payments from the issuer until the bond matures. At that point, the investor reclaims the face value of the bond. The bonds may have a fixed interest rate or a rate that floats according to the movements of a particular [[Economic Indicator|economic indicator]].

Corporate bonds sometimes have [[call provisions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callprovision.asp) to allow for early prepayment if prevailing interest rates change so dramatically that the company deems it can do better by issuing a new bond.

Investors may also opt to sell bonds before they mature. If a bond is sold, the owner gets less than face value. The amount it is worth is determined primarily by the number of payments that still are due before the bond matures.

Investors may also [[Gain|gain]] access to corporate bonds by investing in any number of bond-focused mutual funds or ETFs.

## Why Corporations Sell Bonds

Corporate bonds are a form of [[debt financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtfinancing.asp). They are a major source of capital for many businesses, along with [[Equity|equity]], bank loans, and lines of credit. They often are issued to provide the ready cash for a particular project the company wants to undertake. [[Debt Financing|Debt financing]] is sometimes preferable to issuing [[Stock|stock]] (equity financing) because it is typically cheaper for the borrowing firm and does not entail giving up any ownership stake or control in the company.

Generally speaking, a company needs to have consistent earnings potential to be able to [[Offer|offer]] [[Debt|debt]] securities to the public at a favorable [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]]. If a company's perceived credit quality is higher, it can issue more debt at lower rates.

When a corporation needs a very short-term capital boost, it may sell commercial paper, which is similar to a bond but typically matures in 270 days or less.

## The Difference Between Corporate Bonds and [[Stocks]]

An investor who buys a corporate bond is lending money to the company. An investor who buys [[Stock|stock]] is buying an ownership share of the company.

The value of a [[Stock|stock]] rises and falls, and the investor's stake rises or falls with it. The investor may make money by selling the stock when it reaches a higher price, or by collecting dividends paid by the company, or both.

By investing in bonds, an investor is paid in interest rather than profits. The original investment can only be at [[Risk|risk]] if the company collapses.One important difference is that even a bankrupt company must pay its bondholders and other creditors first. [[Stock]] owners may be reimbursed for their losses only after all of those debts are paid in full.

Companies may also issue [[convertible bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertiblebond.asp), which are able to be turned into [[Shares|shares]] of the company if certain conditions are met.

A balanced [[Portfolio|portfolio]] may contain some bonds to offset riskier investments. The percentage devoted to bonds may grow as the investor approaches retirement.
