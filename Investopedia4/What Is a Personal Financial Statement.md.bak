[[What Is a Personal Financial Statement]]?
## [[What Is a Personal Financial Statement]]?

The term personal financial statement refers to a document or spreadsheet that outlines an individual's financial position at a given point in time. The statement typically includes general information about the individual, such as name and address, along with a breakdown of total [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) and [[liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liability|liability]].asp). The statement can help individuals track their financial goals and wealth, and can be used when they apply for [[credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp).

## Understanding the Personal Financial Statement

[Financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) can be prepared for either companies or individuals. An individual’s financial statement is referred to as a personal financial statement and is a simpler version of [[corporate statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp). Both are tools that can show the financial health of the subject.

A personal financial statement shows the individual's [[net worth]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networth.asp)—their assets minus their liabilities—which reflects what that person has in cash if they sell all their assets and pay off all their debts. If their liabilities are greater than their assets, the financial statement indicates a negative [[Net Worth|net worth]]. If the individual has more assets than liabilities, they end up with a positive net worth.

Keeping an updated personal financial statement allows an individual to track how their financial health improves or deteriorates over time. These can be invaluable tools when consumers want to change their financial sitution or apply for credit such as a [[Loan|loan]] or a [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp). Knowing where they stand financially allows consumers to avoid unnecessary inquiries on their [[credit reports]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp) and the hassles of declined credit applications.

The statement allows also [[credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp) officers to easily [[Gain|gain]] perspective into the applicant's financial situation in order to make an informed credit decision. In many cases, the individual or couple may be asked to provide a [[Personal Guarantee|personal guarantee]] for part of the [[Loan|loan]] or they may be required to put up [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp) to secure the loan.

### Key Takeaways

-   A personal financial statement lists all assets and liabilities of an individual or couple.
-   An individual's [[Net Worth|net worth]] is determined by subtracting their liabilities from their assets—a positive net worth shows more assets than liabilities.
-   [[Net Worth|Net worth]] can fluctuate over time as the values of asset and liabilities change.
-   Personal financial statements are helpful for tracking wealth and goals, as well as applying for credit.
-   Although they may be included in a personal financial statement, income and expenses are generally placed on a separate sheet called the income statement.

## Special Considerations

A personal financial statement is broken down into assets and liabilities. Assets include the value of [[securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) and funds held in [[checking or savings accounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/checking-vs-savings-accounts-4783514), retirement account balances, [[trading accounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingaccount.asp), and real [[Estate|estate]]. Liabilities include any debts the individual may have including personal loans, credit cards, student loans, [[unpaid taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/back-taxes.asp), and mortgages. Debts that are jointly owned are also included. Married couples may create [[Joint|joint]] personal financial statements by combining their assets and liabilities.

Income and expenses are also included if the statement is used to attain credit or to show someone's overall financial position. This can be tracked on a separate sheet or an addendum, called the [[income statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp). This includes all forms of income and expenses—typically expressed in the form of monthly or yearly amounts.

The following items are not included in a personal financial statement:

-   **Business-related assets and liabilities:** These are excluded unless the individual is directly and personally responsible. So if someone [[personally guarantees]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-guarantee.asp) a [[Loan|loan]] for their business—similar to [[cosigning]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/co_sign.asp)—the loan is included in their personal financial statement.
-   **Rented items:** Anything rented is not included in personal financial statements because the assets aren't owned. This changes if you own the property and rent it out to someone else. In this case, the value of the [[property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property.asp) is included in your asset list.
-   **[[Personal Property|Personal property]]:** Items such as furniture and household goods are typically not included as assets on a [[personal balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/090415/do-dividends-go-balance-sheet.asp) because these items can’t easily be sold to pay off a [[Loan|loan]]. Personal property with significant value, such as jewelry and antiques, may be included if their value can be verified with an [[appraisal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp).

Business liabilities are only included in a personal financial statement if an individual provides the [[Creditor|creditor]] with a [[Personal Guarantee|personal guarantee]].

Keep in mind. Your credit report and [[credit history]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp) are big considerations when it comes to getting new credit and every [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) has different requirements for issuing credit. So, even if you have a positive [[Net Worth|net worth]]—more assets than liabilities—you may still be refused a [[Loan|loan]] or [[credit card]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp) if you haven't paid your previous debts on time or have too many inquiries on file.

## Example of a Personal Financial Statement

Let's assume that Henry wants to track his [[Net Worth|net worth]] as he moves toward [[retirement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement.asp). He has been paying off debts, saving money, [[investing]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invest1000.asp), and is getting closer to owning his home. Each year, he updates the statement to see the progress he has made.

Here's how he would break it down. He would list all his assets—$20,000 for a car, $200,000 for his house, $300,000 in investments, and $50,000 in cash and [[equivalents]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashequivalents.asp). He also owns some highly collectible stamps and art valued at $20,000 that he can list. His total assets are, therefore, $590,000. As for liabilities, Henry owes $5,000 on the car and $50,000 for his house. Although makes all of his purchases with a credit card, he pays the balance off each month and never carries a balance. Henry cosigned a [[Loan|loan]] for his daughter and there is $10,000 remaining on that. Even though it is not Henry's loan, he is still responsible, so it is included in the statement. Henry's liabilities are $65,000.

When we subtract his liabilities from his assets, Henry's [[Net Worth|net worth]] is $525,000. Although he uses it mainly to track his financial health, Henry can use this information—and the statement as a whole—if he wants to apply for any other credit.
