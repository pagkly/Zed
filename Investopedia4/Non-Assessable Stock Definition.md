[[Non-Assessable Stock Definition]]
## What Is a Non-Assessable [[Stock]]?

A non-assessable [[Stock|stock]] is a class of stock in which the issuing company is not allowed to impose [[levies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/levy.asp) on its shareholders for additional funds in order to make further investments. The maximum [[Liability|liability]] the purchaser of the stock assumes is equal to the initial [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of the [[Shares|shares]]. [[Stocks]] issued by U.S. companies and traded on U.S. exchanges (and almost all other exchanges) are generally non-assessable.

### Key Takeaways

-   Non-assessable refers to a class of [[Shares|shares]] that do not allow the issuer to demand additional payment for the shares from stockholders.
-   The majority of [[Shares|shares]] are currently non-assessable.
-   In the 19th century, companies issued assessable [[Stock|stock]] at a discount with the understanding that the issuer could levy an assessment for more funds on shareholders in the future.

## Understanding Non-Assessable [[Stock]]

A non-assessable [[Stock|stock]] is the opposite of an [[assessable stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assessablestock.asp), a now-defunct type of [[primary offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primaryoffering.asp). Assessable stock was the primary type of [[Equity|equity]] issued in the late 1800s. Assessable stock was usually sold at a discount and allowed the issuer to gather additional funds from investors after their initial purchase of the stock.

For example, a share of [[Stock|stock]] with a face value of $20 might be sold for $5. At some point, the issuer would serve the investors with an assessment for more fundsâ€”up to the entire discounted amount (In this example, $15). If an investor refused to pay, the stock returned to the issuing company.

Not surprisingly, assessable [[Stock|stock]] proved to be unpopular. Most companies switched over to issuing non-assessable stock in the early 1900s, and the last assessable [[Shares|shares]] were sold in the 1930s.

Although [[Equity|equity]] was no longer sold [[at a discount]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-a-discount.asp) compared to its share price, investors were more confident about buying non-assessable [[Stocks|stocks]] because they no longer had to worry about the possibility that the issuer would force them to invest more money in the [[Stock|stock]] after the initial transaction.

For any [[Equity|equity]] [[Offering|offering]] that is registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]], it is standard to include the opinion of a law firm that states the [[Shares|shares]] are "duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable."

The largest investment the purchaser of a non-assessable [[Stock|stock]] has to make is the initial [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of the [[Shares|shares]]. The investor may lose the invested amount if the stock price goes to zero. However, the investor [[Will|will]] never be required by the issuing company to make additional investments as a condition of their stock ownership.

When a [[Stock|stock]] is non-assessable, it also means that if the issuing company goes bankrupt, the shareholders cannot lose more money than they invested in the first place.

## Example of a Non-Assessable [[Stock]]

Non-assessable [[Stocks|stocks]] have the word "non-assessable" printed on their [[stock certificates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockcertificate.asp).

This [[Vintage|vintage]] Pennsylvania Power & Light Company [[Common Stock|common stock]] certificate for 20 [[Shares|shares]], dating from 1973, contains the phrase "fully paid and non-assessable shares of the common [[Stock|stock]] without nominal or par value." The phrase is common for boilerplate language.
