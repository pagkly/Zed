[[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)]]
## What Is [[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)]]?

[[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)|Discounted cash flow (DCF)]] is a [[valuation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp) method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future [[cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp). DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it [[Will|will]] generate in the future.

This applies to investment decisions of investors in companies or securities, such as acquiring a company, investing in a technology startup or buying a [[Stock|stock]], and for business owners and managers looking to make capital budgeting or operating expenditures decisions such as opening a new factory, purchasing or leasing new equipment.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)|Discounted cash flow (DCF)]] helps determine the value of an investment based on its future cash flows.
-   The present value of expected future cash flows is arrived at by using a [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] to calculate the [[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)|discounted cash flow (DCF)]].
-   If the [[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)|discounted cash flow (DCF)]] is above the current cost of the investment, the opportunity could result in positive returns.
-   Companies typically use the [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] for the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]], as it takes into consideration the rate of [[Return|return]] expected by shareholders.
-   The DCF has limitations, primarily that it relies on estimations on future cash flows, which could prove to be inaccurate.

#### [[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)]]

## How Discounted [[Cash Flow]] Works

The purpose of DCF analysis is to estimate the money an investor would receive from an investment, adjusted for the [[time value of money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp). The time value of money assumes that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because it can be invested. As such, a DCF analysis is appropriate in any situation where a person is paying money in the present with expectations of receiving more money in the future.

For example, assuming a 5% annual interest rate, $1.00 in a savings account [[Will|will]] be worth $1.05 in a year. Similarly, if a $1 payment is delayed for a year, its present value is $.95 because it cannot be put in your savings account to earn interest.

DCF analysis finds the [[present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp) of expected future cash flows using a [[discount rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp). Investors can use the concept of the present value of money to determine whether future cash flows of an investment or project are equal to or greater than the value of the initial investment. If the value calculated through DCF is higher than the current cost of the investment, the opportunity should be considered.

In order to conduct a DCF analysis, an investor must make estimates about future cash flows and the ending value of the investment, equipment, or other asset. The investor must also determine an appropriate [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] for the DCF model, which [[Will|will]] vary depending on the project or investment under consideration, such as the company or investor's [[Risk|risk]] profile and the conditions of the [[Capital Markets What You Should Know|capital markets]]. If the investor cannot access the future cash flows, or the project is very complex, DCF will not have much value and alternative models should be employed.

## Discounted [[Cash Flow]] Formula

The formula for DCF is:

DCF\=CF11+r1+CF21+r2+CFn1+rnwhere:CF\=The cash flow for the given year.CF1 is for year one,  is for year two,CF2CFn is for additional yearsr\=The discount rate\\begin{aligned}&DCF=\\frac{CF\_1}{1+r}^1+\\frac{CF\_2}{1+r}^2+\\frac{CF\_n}{1+r}^n\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&CF=\\text{The [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] for the given year.}\\\\&\\qquad\\quad\\text{$CF\_1$ is for year one, $CF\_2$ is for year two,}\\\\&\\qquad\\quad\\text{$CF\_n$ is for additional years}\\\\&r=\\text{The [[Discount Rate|discount rate]]}\\end{aligned}

## Example of Discounted [[Cash Flow]]

When a company looks to analyze whether it should invest in a certain project or purchase new equipment, it usually uses its [[weighted average cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) (WACC) as the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] when evaluating the DCF. The WACC incorporates the average rate of [[Return|return]] that shareholders in the firm are expecting for the given year.

You are looking to invest in a project, and your company's WACC is 5%, so you [[Will|will]] use 5% as your [[Discount Rate|discount rate]]. The initial investment is $11 million and the project will last for five years, with the following estimated cash flows per year:

[[Cash Flow]]

Year

[[Cash Flow]]

1

$1 million

2

$1 million

3

$4 million

4

$4 million

5

$6 million

Therefore, the discounted cash flows for the project are:

Discounted [[Cash Flow]]

Year

[[Cash Flow]]

Discounted [[Cash Flow]]

1

$1 million

$952,38 1

2

$1 million

$907,029

3

$4 million

$3,455,430

4

$4 million

$3,290,810

5

$6 million

$4,701,157

If we sum up all of the discounted cash flows, we get a value of $13,306,728. Subtracting the initial investment of $11 million, we get a [[net present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) (NPV) of $2,306,728. Because this is a positive number, the cost of the investment today is worth it as the project [[Will|will]] generate positive discounted cash flows above the initial cost. If the project had cost $14 million, the NPV would have been -$693,272, indicating that the cost of the investment would not be worth it.

Dividend discount models, such as the [[Gordon Growth Model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp) (GGM), for valuing [[Stocks|stocks]] are examples of using discounted cash flows.

## Disadvantages of Discounted [[Cash Flow]]

The main limitation of DCF is that it requires making many assumptions. For one, an investor would have to correctly estimate the future cash flows from an investment or project. The future cash flows would rely on a variety of factors, such as market [demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp), the status of the economy, technology, competition, and unforeseen threats or opportunities.

Estimating future cash flows too high could result in choosing an investment that might not pay off in the future, hurting profits. Estimating cash flows too low, making an investment appear costly, could result in missed opportunities. Choosing a [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] for the model is also an assumption and would have to be estimated correctly for the model to be worthwhile.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you calculate [[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)|discounted cash flow (DCF)]]?

Calculating the DCF of an investment involves three basic steps. First, you forecast the expected cashflows from the investment. Second, you select a [[Discount Rate|discount rate]], typically based on the cost of financing the investment or the opportunity cost presented by alternative investments. The third and final step is to discount the forecasted cashflows back to the present day, using a financial calculator, a spreadsheet, or a manual calculation.

### What is an example of a DCF calculation?

To illustrate, suppose you have a [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] of 10% and an investment opportunity that would produce $100 per year for the following three years. Your goal is to calculate the value today—in other words, the “present value”—of this stream of cashflows. Since money in the future is worth less than money today, you reduce the present value of each of these cashflows by your 10% discount rate. Specifically, the first year’s cashflow is worth $90.91 today, the second year’s cashflow is worth $82.64 today, and the third year’s cashflow is worth $75.13 today. Adding up these three cashflows, you conclude that the DCF of the investment is $248.68.

### Is DCF the same as [[Net Present Value (NPV)|net present value (NPV)]]?

No, DCF is not the same as NPV, although the two are closely related concepts. Essentially, NPV adds a fourth step to the DCF calculation process. After forecasting the expected cash flows, selecting a [[Discount Rate|discount rate]], and discounting those cash flows, NPV then deducts the upfront cost of the investment from the investment’s DCF. For instance, if the cost of purchasing the investment in our above example were $200, then the NPV of that investment would be $248.68 minus $200, or $48.68.
