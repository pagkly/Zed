[[What Does It Mean to Be Financially Delinquent]]?
## What Is Delinquent?

Delinquent describes something or someone who fails to accomplish that which is required by law, duty, or contractual agreement, such as the failure to make a required payment or perform a particular action.

In the world of [[Finance|finance]] and investing, delinquency occurs when an individual or corporation with a contractual obligation to make payments against a [[Debt|debt]], such as [[Loan|loan]] payments or the interest on a bond does not make those payments on time or in a regular, timely manner.

Delinquent also refers to the failure to perform a duty or act in a manner expected of a person in a particular profession or situation. For example, a registered [[investment advisor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentadvisor.asp) who puts a conservative, income-oriented client into a highly speculative [[Stock|stock]] could be found delinquent in his [[Fiduciary|fiduciary]] duties. If an insurance company fails to warn a universal life policyholder that their policy is in danger of lapsing due to insufficient [[Premium|premium]] payments, it could be considered delinquent.

### Key Takeaways

-   Delinquent describes something or someone who fails to accomplish that which is required by law, duty, or contractual agreement.
-   Delinquency occurs as soon as a borrower misses a payment on a [[Loan|loan]]. In contrast, [[Default|default]] occurs when a borrower fails to repay the loan as specified in the original contract.
-   Most creditors allow a [[Loan|loan]] to remain delinquent for some time before considering it in [[Default|default]].

## Understanding Delinquent

In the [[Personal Finance|personal finance]] field, the term "delinquent" commonly refers to a situation where a borrower is late or overdue on a payment, such as income taxes, a mortgage, an automobile [[Loan|loan]], or a [[credit card]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp) account.

There are consequences for being delinquent, depending on the type, duration, and cause of the delinquency. People who are late with a credit card payment may be forced to pay a [[late fee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/late-fee.asp). In the case of a mortgage, the [[Lender|lender]] can initialize [[foreclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp) proceedings if the mortgage payments are not brought up to date within a certain amount of time.

## Delinquent vs. [[Default]]

In a financial sense, delinquency occurs as soon as a borrower misses a payment on a [[Loan|loan]]. In contrast, [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) occurs when a borrower fails to repay the loan as specified in the original contract. Most creditors allow a loan to remain delinquent for some time before considering it in [[Default|default]]. The duration lenders allow for delinquency depends on the [[Creditor|creditor]] and the type of loan involved.

For example, the U.S. federal government allows student [[Debt|debt]] to be delinquent for 270 days before declaring it to be in [[Default|default]]. Most lenders consider single-family mortgages [[seriously delinquent]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/serious_delinquency.asp) if they are 90 days behind in payment, after which they are in default and subject to [[foreclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp).

## Current and Historical Delinquency Rates

According to Federal Reserve bank statistics, [delinquency rates in the U.S.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/chargeoff/delallsa.htm), have been steadily declining since reaching a Great Recession-high of 7.4% in the first quarter of 2010—with a record-breaking 11.3% on residential real [[Estate|estate]] loans alone.

As of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, [[delinquency rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delinquency-rate.asp) in the U.S. were 2.83% on residential real [[Estate|estate]] loans and 0.78% on commercial real estate loans. The overall real estate delinquency rate was 1.79%, the lowest since the pre-subprime mortgage crisis days of 2006.

In terms of other consumer [[Debt|debt]], the delinquency rate was 2.54% on credit card loans at the end of 2018—climbing a bit since 2015, but still well below the high of 6.77% in 2009. Consumer loans overall had a delinquency rate of 2.34%; in 2009, they were double that.

## Real World Example

The [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-reserve-bank-of-new-york.asp) found that in the fourth quarter of 2018, delinquent U.S. [[student loans reached]](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html) a new record of US$166 billion. However, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York states that delinquency rates for student loans are likely understated by as much as half, meaning that about $333 billion of student [[Loan|loan]] [[Debt|debt]] has not been serviced in at least three months as of the end of Q4 2018. This figure underscores the true extent of the student loan crisis.
