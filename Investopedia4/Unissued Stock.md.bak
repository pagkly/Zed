[[Unissued Stock]]
## What Is [[Unissued Stock]]?

[[Unissued Stock|Unissued stock]] are company [[shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Shares|shares]].asp) that do not circulate, nor have they been put up for sale to either employees or the general public. As such, companies do not print [[stock certificates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockcertificate.asp) for unissued shares. Unissued shares are normally held in a company's treasury. Their number typically has no bearing on shareholders.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Unissued Stock|Unissued stock]] is a class of company [[Shares|shares]] that are not circulating or up for sale by the company on the market.
-   The number of unissued [[Shares|shares]] can be calculated by subtracting the total number of authorized shares from outstanding shares plus treasury [[Stock|stock]] shares.
-   Unissued [[Shares|shares]] may be irrelevant to current stockholders because they do not qualify for voting rights nor receive dividends.
-   [[Unissued Stock|Unissued stock]] may indicate the potential for events or developments that may dilute a company's earnings per share.

## Understanding [[Unissued Stock]]

When a company goes public, it authorizes a certain number of [[Shares|shares]] to be created in its charter or articles of incorporation. These shares are referred to as [[authorized stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedstock.asp). Authorized [[Stock|stock]] is comprised of all stock that has been created, including shares up for sale to investors and issued to employees, as well as any shares not up for sale. The former is called [[outstanding stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp), while the latter is referred to as unissued shares. Companies do not print up certificates for [[Unissued Stock|unissued stock]], which are held in the company's treasury.

The number of unissued [[Shares|shares]] can be calculated by taking total shares authorized for issuance and subtracting this from total shares outstanding plus [[treasury stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurystock.asp) shares. Treasury [[Stock|stock]] are the shares repurchased by a company.

Unissued [[Shares|shares]] are not relevant to stockholders, in the sense that these shares do not qualify for voting rights nor do they receive [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp). But this can change, as they represent the possibility for a [[dilution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp) in the value of existing shareholder ownership—and thus share value—should the company choose to issue additional shares of [[Stock|stock]] in the future.

[[Unissued Stock|Unissued stock]] may dilute existing shareholder value if a company decides to release more [[Stock|stock]] in the future.

Analysts and investors closely monitor a company's plans for issuance of previously unissued [[Shares|shares]]. Funding plans that call for issuance of shares could be dilutive to the company's [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS).

Though they represent a potential source of ownership and earnings dilution for investors, unissued [[Shares|shares]] are not included in fully diluted earnings per share calculations. But earnings per share calculations do take into account the potential for convertible securities to be converted into [[Equity|equity]] as well as [[Stock|stock]] options granted but not yet exercised.

## [[Unissued Stock]] vs. Treasury [[Shares]]

[[Unissued Stock|Unissued stock]] is generally not the same as treasury [[Stock|stock]]. Treasury stock represents any [[Shares|shares]] that have already been issued and sold, but have subsequently been [[repurchased by the company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharerepurchase.asp). But the lines between the two may be slightly blurred, as some companies may choose to list these shares as unissued stock.

Companies which choose to list treasury [[Shares|shares]] as [[Unissued Stock|unissued stock]] have [[corporate charters]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatecharter.asp) that allow for the issuance of a large number of [[Stock|stock]] shares to provide maximum flexibility in the event future stock sales are needed. A company might disclose in the notes of its financial statements that it has authorization to issue 10 million shares, but only a fraction of that amount might be both issued and outstanding.

Let's look at a real example. A 2016 8-K filed with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) by Dollar Tree ([DLTR](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=DLTR)) states: "[[Shares]] purchased under the share repurchase authorizations are generally held in treasury or are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares."1
