[[Worthless Securities]]
## What Are [[Worthless Securities]]?

[[Worthless Securities|Worthless securities]] have a [[market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp) of zero. Worthless securities can include [[Stocks|stocks]] or bonds that are either publicly traded or privately held. These securities, along with any securities that an investor has abandoned, result in a [[capital loss]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalloss.asp) for the owner and can be claimed as such when filing taxes.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Worthless Securities|Worthless securities]] are [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds or other [[Holdings|holdings]] that have no market value; they can be publicly-traded or held privately.
-   The IRS recommends investors account for [[Worthless Securities|worthless securities]] as if they were capital assets that had been dumped or exchanged on the last day of the tax year.
-   As such, these securities can be claimed as a capital loss when the investor files their taxes; the holding period determines whether the loss is short-term or long-term.
-   Penny [[Stocks|stocks]] have comparatively little market value but are not considered worthless.

## Understanding [[Worthless Securities]]

To declare a capital loss from [[Worthless Securities|worthless securities]], the [[Internal Revenue Service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) suggests investors treat them as if they were capital assets sold or exchanged on the final day of the tax year. As with other securities, investors must first figure out the [[holding period]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiod.asp) to determine if the capital loss is short-term (one year or less) or long-term (greater than one year).

In the case of a short-term loss, investors must report this on Part I of Schedule D. Investors can net short-term gains and losses against one other to determine a net short-term [[Gain|gain]] or loss.

For long-term losses, investors report these in Part II of Schedule D. Again, investors can net long-term gains and losses against each other to determine the net long-term [[Gain|gain]] or loss. After the investor completes these calculations separately in Parts I and II of Schedule D, she can net them together for an overall result.

For more information about tax selling (a strategy in which an investor sells an asset with a capital loss in order to lower or eliminate the capital [[Gain|gain]] that she or he realizes via other investments), see Investopediaâ€™s comprehensive [[definition]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax_selling.asp).

## [[Worthless Securities]] and Methods of Valuation

Public company market value, also known as [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp), is the number of [[outstanding shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) of a publicly-traded company, multiplied by the current share price. For a private company, valuation methods include comparable company analysis and/or an estimation of discounted cash flows. [[Worthless Securities|Worthless securities]] [[Will|will]] have a market value of zero as noted above.

## [[Worthless Securities]] and Penny [[Stocks]]

Because of their small market value, penny [[Stocks|stocks]] typically trade outside of the major market exchanges (through the OTC Bulletin Board \[[OTCBB](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcbb.asp)\] and [[pink sheets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp)) at a relatively low price ($5 or less).

These [[Stocks|stocks]] are considered highly [[speculative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculativecompany.asp) and high [[Risk|risk]], due to their lack of [[Liquidity|liquidity]], large [[bid-ask spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp), small capitalizations, and limited followings and disclosures.
