[[What Is a Non-Security]]?
## [[What Is a Non-Security]]?

A non-[[Security|security]] is an alternative investment that is not traded on a public [[exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp) as [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds are. Assets such as art, rare coins, life insurance, gold, and diamonds all are non-securities.

Non-securities by definition are not liquid assets. That is, they cannot be easily bought or sold on demand as no exchange exists for trading them.

Non-securities also are known as [[real assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realasset.asp).

## Understanding Non-Securities

Individual markets exist for non-securities, ranging from auctions to private listings. However, these are generally specialized sources. Non-securities cannot be purchased on a public exchange such as the NYSE or the [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]].

### Key Takeaways

-   Non-securities, also called real assets, are investments that are not available for purchase or sale on public exchanges.
-   They may, however, be a component of an investment that trades publicly, such as an ETF.
-   Diamonds and fine art are examples of non-[[Security|security]] investments.

While they do not trade on public market exchanges, they may be components of packaged investment offerings that are traded on public exchanges, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

[High [[Net Worth|net worth]] investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hnwi.asp) may have comprehensive portfolios that include valuable non-[[Security|security]] assets such as fine art, precious metals, and real [[Estate|estate]]. Investors may also buy funds that manage portfolios of real assets such as gold. These funds trade on public exchanges.

The SPDR Gold [[Shares]] ETF is one example. The [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is fully invested in gold bullion. This ETF lowers the barriers for investors who would like to [[Hold|hold]] gold real assets in their portfolio.

Some personal financial assets such as life insurance could be called non-securities.

However, non-[[Security|security]] assets do not themselves undergo an institutionalized process for public trading on exchanges. This makes them highly illiquid investments, in contrast to securities such as [[stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp), mutual funds, and bonds.

### Valuation of Non-Securities

The valuation process for non-securities also differs. Market experts in each type of non-[[Security|security]] typically appraise them to estimate their valuations. In some cases, non-securities may require authentication and registration to support their use and potential sale.

These assets, however, do not require the backing of an [[underwriter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp) or bank and involve much less documentation and paperwork.

### Personal Financial Assets as Non-Securities

Some personal financial assets such as life insurance and [[annuities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuity.asp) could be considered non-securities.

Investors have the option to invest in these non-[[Security|security]] assets through an insurance company. Life insurance and annuities are two types of non-security assets that are not publicly traded but rather contractual agreements made with a sponsoring company.

Life insurance and annuities require regular [[Premium|premium]] payments that help to build out a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] that offers a [[Payout|payout]] in the future. Life insurance plans can be used to provide for dependents following the death of a family member. Annuity plans may also [[Offer|offer]] provisions for life insurance. However, they are often used as vehicles for retirement savings with consistent annuity payouts scheduled to follow a targeted payout date.

That makes them assets, although they are not securities.
