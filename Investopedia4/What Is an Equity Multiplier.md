[[What Is an Equity Multiplier]]?
## What Is the [[Equity]] Multiplier?

The [[Equity|equity]] multiplier is a [[Risk|risk]] indicator that measures the portion of a company’s assets that is financed by stockholder's equity rather than by [[Debt|debt]]. It is calculated by dividing a company's total asset value by its total [[shareholders' equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockholdersequity.asp).

Generally, a high [[Equity|equity]] multiplier indicates that a company is using a high amount of [[Debt|debt]] to [[Finance|finance]] assets. A low equity multiplier means that the company has less reliance on debt.

However, a company's [[Equity|equity]] multiplier can be seen as high or low only in comparison to historical standards, the averages for the industry, or the company's peers.

The [[Equity|equity]] multiplier is also known as the [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]] or financial [[Leverage|leverage]] ratio and is one of three ratios used in the [[DuPont analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dupontanalysis.asp).

### Formula and Calculation of the [[Equity]] Multiplier

## Understanding the [[Equity]] Multiplier

Investment in assets is key to running a successful business. Companies [[Finance|finance]] their acquisition of assets by issuing [[Equity|equity]] or [[Debt|debt]], or some combination of both.

The [[Equity|equity]] multiplier reveals how much of the total assets are financed by shareholders' equity. Essentially, this ratio is a [[Risk|risk]] indicator used by investors to determine how leveraged the company is.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Equity|equity]] multiplier is a measure of the portion of the company’s assets that is financed by [[Stock|stock]] rather than [[Debt|debt]].
-   Generally, a high [[Equity|equity]] multiplier indicates that a company has a higher level of [[Debt|debt]].
-   Investors judge a company's [[Equity|equity]] multiplier in the context of its industry and its peers.

A high [[Equity|equity]] multiplier (relative to historical standards, industry averages, or a company's peers) indicates that a company is using a large amount of [[Debt|debt]] to [[Finance|finance]] assets. Companies with a higher debt burden [[Will|will]] have higher [[debt servicing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtservice.asp) costs, which means that they will have to generate more [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] to sustain a healthy business.

A low [[Equity|equity]] multiplier implies that the company has fewer [[Debt|debt]]-financed assets. That is usually seen as a positive as its debt servicing costs are lower. But it could also signal that the company is unable to entice lenders to [[Loan|loan]] it money on favorable terms, which is a problem.

### How Investors Interpret the [[Equity]] Multiplier

There is no ideal [[Equity|equity]] multiplier. It [[Will|will]] vary by the sector or industry a company operates within.

An [[Equity|equity]] multiplier of 2 means that half the company's assets are financed with [[Debt|debt]], while the other half is financed with equity.

The [[Equity|equity]] multiplier is an important factor in DuPont analysis, a method of financial assessment devised by the chemical company for its internal financial review. The DuPont model breaks the calculation of [[return on equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) (ROE) into three ratios: net [[Profit Margin|profit margin]] (NPM), [[asset turnover ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetturnover.asp), and the equity multiplier.

If ROE changes over time or diverges from normal levels for the peer group, the DuPont analysis can indicate how much of this is attributable to use of financial [[Leverage|leverage]]. If the [[Equity|equity]] multiplier fluctuates, it can significantly affect ROE.

Higher financial [[Leverage|leverage]] (i.e. a higher [[Equity|equity]] multiple) drives ROE upward, all other factors remaining equal.

## Examples of [[Equity]] Multiplier Analysis

The [[Equity|equity]] multiplier calculation is straightforward. Consider Apple's (AAPL) balance sheet at the end of the fiscal year 2019. The company's total assets were $338.5 billion, and the book value of shareholder equity was $90.5 billion. The company's equity multiplier was therefore 3.74 ($338.5 billion / $90.5 billion), a bit higher than its equity multiplier for 2018, which was 3.41. 1

Now compare Apple to Verizon Communications (VZ). The company has a very different business model than Apple. The company's total assets were $291.7 billion for the fiscal year 2019, with $62.8 billion of shareholder [[Equity|equity]]. The equity multiplier was 4.64 ($291.7 billion / $62.8 billion), based on these values.2

Verizon's higher [[Equity|equity]] multiplier indicates that the business relies more heavily on financing from [[Debt|debt]] and other interest-bearing liabilities. The company's telecommunications business model is similar to utility companies, which have stable, predictable cash flows and typically carry high debt levels.

On the other hand, Apple is more susceptible to changing [[economic conditions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-conditions.asp) or evolving industry standards than a utility or a traditional telecommunications firm. As a result, Apple carries less financial [[Leverage|leverage]]. It has a relatively low [[Equity|equity]] multiplier.
