[[FAANG Stock]]
## What Are FAANG [[Stocks]]?

In [[Finance|finance]], “FAANG” is an acronym that refers to the [[Stocks|stocks]] of five prominent American [[technology companies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technology_sector.asp): Facebook ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=FB)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AMZN)), Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL4)), Netflix ([NFLX](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=NFLX)); and Alphabet ([GOOG](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GOOG)) (formerly known as Google). 

The term was coined by Jim Cramer, the television host of CNBC's Mad Money, in 2013, who praised these companies for being “totally dominant in their markets”. Originally, the term FANG was used, with Apple—the second “A” in the acronym—added in 2017.

-   FAANG is an acronym referring to the [[Stocks|stocks]] of the five most popular and best-performing American technology companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google). 
-   In addition to being widely known among consumers, the five FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] are among the largest companies in the world, with a combined [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] of nearly $5.6 trillion as of Aug. 13, 2020.12345
-   Some have raised concerns that the FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] may be in the midst of a bubble, whereas others argue that their growth is justified by the stellar financial and operational performance they have shown in recent years.

## Understanding FAANG [[Stocks]]

In addition to being widely known among consumers, the five FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] are among the largest companies in the world, with a combined [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of nearly $5.6 trillion as of Aug. 13, 2020.1 2 3 4 5

Their substantial growth has been buoyed recently by high-profile purchases made by large and influential investors such as Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=brk.b)), Soros Fund Management, and Renaissance Technologies. These are just a few of the many large investors who have added FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] to their [[portfolios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp) because of their perceived strength, growth, or [[momentum]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[Momentum|momentum]].asp). 

Each of the FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] trades on the [[Nasdaq]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/[[Nasdaq|nasdaq]].asp) exchange and is included in the [[S&P 500 Index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp). Since the S&P 500 is a broad representation of the market, the movement of the market mirrors the index's movement. Together, the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&P 500—a staggering figure considering the S&P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the [[United States economy]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/042915/5-industries-driving-us-economy.asp) as a whole. 

This large influence over the index means that [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) in the [[Stock|stock]] price of the FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] can have a substantial effect on the performance of the S&P 500 in general. In August 2018, for example, FAANG stocks were responsible for nearly 40% of the index’s [[Gain|gain]] from the lows reached in February 2018.

## Example of FAANG [[Stocks]]

The extraordinary size and influence of the FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] have prompted concerns about a potential [[bubble]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp) in FAANG stocks. These concerns started gaining prominence in 2018, when technology stocks, which had been driving consistent gains in the [[Stock|stock]] market, began losing their former strength. In November 2018, several FAANG stocks lost more than 20% of their valuations and were declared to be in [[bear territory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp). 

By some estimates, FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] lost more than a trillion dollars from their peak valuations as a result of the steep drop in the markets in November 2018. Although their valuations have since recovered, the level of [[Volatility|volatility]] sometimes shown by FAANG stocks—and the influence these stocks can have on the market overall—is a source of concern for some investors.

On the other hand, those who believe in the fundamental strength of the FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] have abundant evidence for this claim. For example, Facebook is the world’s largest [[social network]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-networking.asp) with approximately 2.7 billion users.6 In its [[trailing twelve months (TTM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) as of June 2020, it posted revenues of $75 billion and [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) of $24 billion.7 8

Amazon, meanwhile, has become a seemingly insurmountable force in [[business to consumer (B2C)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp) e-[[Commerce|commerce]]. With over 120 million products for sale, it has over 150 million active customers in the United States, of whom more than half pay for monthly Amazon Prime memberships. With TTM revenues of $322 billion and a net income of $13 billion, it is not hard to understand why investors believe Amazon’s vast [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] is justified.9 10

Overall, it is through strong financial performance such as this that the FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] have prospered recently. Over the past five years, for instance, Facebook and Amazon have seen [[Stock|stock]]-price increases of 185% and 500%, respectively. For their part, Apple and Alphabet saw price increases of about 175% over that same timeframe, whereas Netflix saw its value rise by nearly 450%.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What makes FAANG [[Stocks|stocks]] so popular?

But critics argue that, even with impressive business performance, the FAANG stocks’ prices have become so expensive that it may be difficult to realize attractive long-term profits from investing in them.
