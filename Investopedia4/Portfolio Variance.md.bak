[[Portfolio Variance]]
## What Is [[Portfolio Variance]]?

[[Portfolio Variance|Portfolio variance]] is a measurement of [[Risk|risk]], of how the aggregate [[actual returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actualreturn.asp) of a set of securities making up a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] fluctuate over time. This portfolio [[variance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp) statistic is calculated using the [[standard deviations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) of each [[Security|security]] in the portfolio as well as the [[correlations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Correlation|correlation]].asp) of each security pair in the portfolio.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Portfolio Variance|Portfolio variance]] is a measure of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s overall [[Risk|risk]] and is the portfolio's [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] squared.
-   [[Portfolio Variance|Portfolio variance]] takes into account the weights and variances of each asset in a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] as well as their covariances.
-   A lower [[Correlation|correlation]] between securities in a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] results in a lower [[Portfolio Variance|portfolio variance]].
-   [[Portfolio Variance|Portfolio variance]] (and [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]]) define the [[Risk|risk]]-axis of the efficient frontier in [[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)|modern portfolio theory (MPT)]].

## Understanding [[Portfolio Variance]]

[[Portfolio Variance|Portfolio variance]] looks at the [[covariance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Covariance|covariance]].asp) or [[correlation coefficients]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlationcoefficient.asp) for the securities in a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. Generally, a lower [[Correlation|correlation]] between securities in a portfolio results in a lower portfolio variance.

[[Portfolio Variance|Portfolio variance]] is calculated by multiplying the squared weight of each [[Security|security]] by its corresponding variance and adding twice the [[weighted average]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weightedaverage.asp) weight multiplied by the [[Covariance|covariance]] of all individual security pairs.

[Modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) says that [[Portfolio Variance|portfolio variance]] can be reduced by choosing asset classes with a low or [[negative correlation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-[[Correlation|correlation]].asp), such as [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds, where the variance (or [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]]) of the portfolio is the x-axis of the [[efficient frontier]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp).

## Formula and Calculation of [[Portfolio Variance]]

The most important quality of [[Portfolio Variance|portfolio variance]] is that its value is a [[Weighted|weighted]] combination of the individual variances of each of the assets adjusted by their covariances. This means that the overall [[Portfolio|portfolio]] variance is lower than a simple weighted average of the individual variances of the [[Stocks|stocks]] in the portfolio.

The formula for [[Portfolio Variance|portfolio variance]] in a two-asset [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is as follows:

-   **[[Portfolio Variance|Portfolio variance]]** = w12σ12 \+ w22σ22 \+ 2w1w2Cov1,2

Where:

-   w1 = the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] weight of the first asset
-   w2 = the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] weight of the second asset
-   σ1\= the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the first asset
-   σ2 = the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the second asset
-   Cov1,2 = the [[Covariance|covariance]] of the two assets, which can thus be expressed as _p_(1,2)σ1σ2, where _p_(1,2) is the [[Correlation|correlation]] coefficient between the two assets

The [[Portfolio Variance|portfolio variance]] is equivalent to the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] squared.

As the number of assets in the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] grows, the terms in the formula for variance increase exponentially. For example, a three-asset portfolio has six terms in the variance calculation, while a five-asset portfolio has 15.

## [[Portfolio Variance]] and Modern [[Portfolio]] Theory

[Modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) (MPT) is a framework for constructing an investment portfolio. MPT takes as its central premise the idea that rational investors want to maximize returns while also minimizing [[Risk|risk]], sometimes measured using [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp). Investors seek what is called an efficient frontier, or the lowest level of risk and volatility at which a target [[Return|return]] can be achieved.

[[Risk]] is lowered in MPT portfolios by investing in non-correlated assets. Assets that might be risky on their own can actually lower the overall risk of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] by introducing an investment that [[Will|will]] rise when other investments fall. This reduced [[Correlation|correlation]] can reduce the variance of a theoretical portfolio.

In this sense, an individual investment's [[Return|return]] is less important than its overall contribution to the [[Portfolio|portfolio]], in terms of [[Risk|risk]], return, and [[diversification]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Diversification|diversification]].asp).

The level of [[Risk|risk]] in a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is often measured using [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]], which is calculated as the square root of the variance. If data points are far away from the mean, the variance is high, and the overall level of risk in the portfolio is high as well. [[Standard deviation is a key measure of risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021915/how-standard-deviation-used-determine-risk.asp) used by portfolio managers, financial advisors, and institutional investors. Asset managers routinely include standard deviation in their performance reports.

## Example of [[Portfolio Variance]]

For example, assume there is a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] that consists of two [[Stocks|stocks]]. [[Stock]] A is worth $50,000 and has a [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of 20%. Stock B is worth $100,000 and has a standard deviation of 10%. The [[Correlation|correlation]] between the two stocks is 0.85. Given this, the portfolio weight of Stock A is 33.3% and 66.7% for Stock B. Plugging in this information into the formula, the variance is calculated to be:

-   **Variance** = (33.3%^2 x 20%^2) + (66.7%^2 x 10%^2) + (2 x 33.3% x 20% x 66.7% x 10% x 0.85) = 1.64%

Variance is not a particularly easy statistic to interpret on its own, so most analysts calculate the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]], which is simply the square root of variance. In this example, the square root of 1.64% is 12.81%.
