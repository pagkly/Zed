[[Lock In Profits Definition]]
## What Is Lock In Profits?

Locking in profits refers to the realization of previously [[unrealized gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unrealizedgain.asp) accrued in a [[Security|security]] by closing all or a portion of the [[Holdings|holdings]]. When an investor holds an open position, they may accrue _unrealized_ or [[paper gains or losses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paperprofitorloss.asp) that aren't realized until the position is closed. An example is when an investor that's long a security can lock in profits by selling their stake for a [[Gain|gain]]. By doing this they are no longer subject to changes in the [[Underlying|underlying]].

Also known as "realization" or "taking money off the table."

## Understanding Lock In Profits

Traders and investors may lock in profits for many different reasons, but often times, it's to reduce [[Risk|risk]]. 

Long-term investors may lock in profits to maintain their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] balance. For example, an investor may have started with a portfolio divided equally among five funds. If one fund outperforms, its portfolio [[allocation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp) might grow from 20 percent to 30 percent, which exposes the investor to added [[Risk|risk]]. The investor may lock in the profits for a portion of the [[outperforming]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/[[Outperform|outperform]].asp) fund and redistribute the proceeds among the other four funds to maintain an ideal portfolio allocation that minimizes risk and maximizes profits.

Short-term traders often lock in profits to generate income and reduce [[Risk|risk]]. For example, a trader may open a [[long position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) after a bullish [[Earnings Announcement|earnings announcement]] with a series of [[price targets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetarget.asp). After the [[Stock|stock]] reaches the first price target, the trader may lock in profits for one-third of the position and continue to [[Hold|hold]] the other two-thirds of the position until a higher price target is reached. This way, the trader is taking some money off the table and reducing their risk if the stock were to suddenly turn lower.

Traders set price targets to lock in profits using various forms of [[technical analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp), such as [[technical indicators]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp) or chart patterns, whereas long-term investors may lock in profits based on asset allocations or [[risk tolerance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp).

## Example of Locking in Profits

Suppose that you purchase 100 [[Shares|shares]] of Acme Co. for $12 and the price went up to $36 two days later. All potential profits are unrealized because the position isn't partially or fully closed. If the [[Stock|stock]] moves lower, your profits [[Will|will]] dwindle, and vice versa if it goes higher. You may decide to lock in the profits by selling 50 shares because 50 x $36 = $1,800. Even if the stock ends up dropping to $1, you will have still made a profit. In other words, locking in profits made it possible to "play with house money" in the investment.
