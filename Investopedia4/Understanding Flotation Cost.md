[[Understanding Flotation Cost]]
## What Is a [[Flotation]] Cost?

[[Flotation]] costs are incurred by a publicly-traded company when it issues new [[securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) and incurs expenses, such as [[underwriting fees]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting-fees.asp), legal fees, and registration fees. Companies must consider the impact these fees [[Will|will]] have on how much capital they can raise from a [[New Issue|new issue]]. Flotation costs, expected [[return on equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp), dividend payments, and the percentage of earnings the business expects to retain are all part of the equation to calculate a company's cost of new [[Equity|equity]].

#### Understanding and Calculating [[Flotation]] Costs

## The Formula for Float in New [[Equity]] Is

The equation for calculating the [[Flotation|flotation]] cost of new [[Equity|equity]] using the [[dividend growth rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendgrowthrate.asp) is:

Dividend growth rate\=D1P∗(1−F)+g\\text{Dividend growth rate} = \\frac{D\_1}{P \* \\left(1-F\\right)} + g

Where:

-   D1 = the dividend in the next period
-   P = the issue price of one share of [[Stock|stock]]
-   F = ratio of [[Flotation|flotation]] cost-to-[[Stock|stock]] issue price
-   g = the dividend growth rate

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Flotation]] costs are costs a company incurs when it issues new [[Stock|stock]].
-   [[Flotation]] costs make new [[Equity|equity]] cost more than existing equity.
-   Analysts argue that [[Flotation|flotation]] costs are a one-time expense that should be adjusted out of future cash flows in order to not overstate the [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] forever.

## What Do [[Flotation]] Costs Tell You?

Companies raise capital in two ways: [[Debt|debt]] via bonds and loans or [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp). Some companies prefer issuing bonds or obtaining a [[Loan|loan]], especially when interest rates are low and because the interest paid on many debts is tax-deductible, while equity returns are not. Other companies prefer equity because it does not need to be paid back; however, selling equity also entails giving up an ownership stake in the company.

There are [[Flotation|flotation]] costs associated with issuing new [[Equity|equity]], or newly issued [[common stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp). These include costs such as investment banking and legal fees, accounting and audit fees, and fees paid to a [[Stock|stock]] exchange to list the company's [[Shares|shares]]. The difference between the cost of existing equity and the cost of new equity is the flotation cost.

The [[Flotation|flotation]] cost is expressed as a percentage of the issue price and is incorporated into the price of new [[Shares|shares]] as a reduction. A company [[Will|will]] often use a [[weighted cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) (WACC) calculation to determine what share of its funding should be raised from new [[Equity|equity]] and what portion from [[Debt|debt]].

## Example of a [[Flotation]] Cost Calculation

As an example, assume Company A needs capital and decides to raise $100 million in [[Common Stock|common stock]] at $10 per share to meet its capital requirements. Investment bankers receive 7% of the funds raised. Company A pays out $1 in dividends per share next year and is expected to increase dividends by 10% the following year.

Using these variables, the cost of new [[Equity|equity]] is calculated with the following equation:

-   ($1 / ($10 \* (1-7%)) + 10%

The answer is 20.7%. If the analyst assumes no [[Flotation|flotation]] cost, the answer is the cost of existing [[Equity|equity]]. The cost of existing equity is calculated with the following formula:

-   ($1 / ($10 \* (1-0%)) + 10%

The answer is 20.0%. The difference between the cost of new [[Equity|equity]] and the cost of existing equity is the [[Flotation|flotation]] cost, which is (20.7-20.0%) = 0.7%. In other words, the flotation costs increased the cost of the new equity issuance by 0.7%.

## Limitations of Using [[Flotation]] Costs

Some analysts argue that including [[Flotation|flotation]] costs in the company's [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] implies that flotation costs are an ongoing expense, and forever overstates the firm's [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]]. In reality, a firm pays the flotation costs one time upon issuing new [[Equity|equity]]. To offset this, some analysts adjust the company's cash flows for flotation costs.
