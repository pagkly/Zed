[[One-Tailed Test]]
## What Is a [[One-Tailed Test]]?

A [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]] is a statistical test in which the critical area of a distribution is one-sided so that it is either greater than or less than a certain value, but not both. If the sample being tested falls into the one-sided critical area, the alternative hypothesis [[Will|will]] be accepted instead of the null hypothesis.

A [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]] is also known as a directional hypothesis or directional test.

## The Basics of a [[One-Tailed Test]]

A basic concept in inferential statistics is [[hypothesis testing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hypothesistesting.asp). Hypothesis testing is run to determine whether a claim is true or not, given a population parameter. A test that is conducted to show whether the mean of the sample is significantly greater than **_and_** significantly less than the mean of a population is considered a [[two-tailed test]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two-tailed-test.asp). When the testing is set up to show that the sample mean would be higher **_or_** lower than the population mean, it is referred to as a [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]]. The one-tailed test gets its name from testing the area under one of the tails (sides) of a [[normal distribution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp), although the test can be used in other non-normal distributions as well.

Before the [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]] can be performed, null and alternative hypotheses have to be established. A [[null hypothesis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/null_hypothesis.asp) is a claim that the researcher hopes to reject. An alternative hypothesis is the claim that is supported by rejecting the null hypothesis.

### key takeaways

-   A [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]] is a statistical hypothesis test set up to show that the sample mean would be higher _or_ lower than the population mean, but not both.
-   When using a [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]], the analyst is testing for the possibility of the relationship in one direction of interest, and completely disregarding the possibility of a relationship in another direction.
-   Before running a [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]], the analyst must set up a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis and establish a probability value (p-value).

## Example of a [[One-Tailed Test]]

Let's say an analyst wants to prove that a [[portfolio manager]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanager.asp) outperformed the [[S&P 500 index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) in a given year by 16.91%. He may set up the null (H0) and alternative (Ha) hypotheses as:

H0: μ ≤ 16.91

Ha: μ > 16.91

The null hypothesis is the measurement that the analyst hopes to reject. The alternative hypothesis is the claim made by the analyst that the [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] performed better than the S&P 500. If the outcome of the [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]] results in rejecting the null, the alternative hypothesis [[Will|will]] be supported. On the other hand, if the outcome of the test fails to reject the null, the analyst may carry out further analysis and investigation into the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] manager’s performance.

The region of rejection is on only one side of the sampling distribution in a [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]]. To determine how the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s [[return on investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) compares to the [[Market Index|market index]], the analyst must run an upper-tailed significance test in which extreme values fall in the upper tail (right side) of the [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] curve. The one-tailed test conducted in the upper or right tail area of the curve [[Will|will]] show the analyst how much higher the portfolio [[Return|return]] is than the index return and whether the difference is significant.

### 1%, 5% or 10%

The most common significance levels (p-values) used in a [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]].

## Determining Significance in a [[One-Tailed Test]]

To determine how significant the difference in returns is, a [[significance level]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statistically_significant.asp) must be specified. The significance level is almost always represented by the letter "p", which stands for probability. The level of significance is the probability of incorrectly concluding that the null hypothesis is false. The significance value used in a [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]] is either 1%, 5% or 10%, although any other probability measurement can be used at the discretion of the analyst or statistician. The probability value is calculated with the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. The lower the [[p-value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/p-value.asp), the stronger the evidence that the null hypothesis is false.

If the resulting p-value is less than 5%, then the difference between both observations is statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected. Following our example above, if p-value = 0.03, or 3%, then the analyst can be 97% confident that the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] returns did not equal or fall below the [[Return|return]] of the market for the year. He [[Will|will]], therefore, reject H0 and support the claim that the [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] outperformed the index. The probability calculated in only one tail of a distribution is half the probability of a two-tailed distribution if similar measurements were tested using both hypothesis testing tools.

When using a [[One-Tailed Test|one-tailed test]], the analyst is testing for the possibility of the relationship in one direction of interest, and completely disregarding the possibility of a relationship in another direction. Using our example above, the analyst is interested in whether a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s [[Return|return]] is greater than the market’s. In this case, he does not need to statistically account for a situation in which the [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] underperformed the [[S&P 500 Index|S&P 500 index]]. For this reason, a one-tailed test is only appropriate when it is not important to test the outcome at the other end of a distribution.
