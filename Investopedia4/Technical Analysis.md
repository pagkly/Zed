[[Technical Analysis]]
## What Is [[Technical Analysis]]?

[[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.

Unlike [[Fundamental Analysis|fundamental analysis]], which attempts to evaluate a [[Security|security]]'s value based on business results such as sales and earnings, [technical analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analyst.asp) focuses on the study of price and volume. [[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] tools are used to scrutinize the ways [[Supply|supply]] and demand for a security [[Will|will]] affect changes in price, volume and implied [[Volatility|volatility]]. Technical analysis is often used to generate short-term trading signals from various charting tools, but can also help improve the evaluation of a security's strength or weakness relative to the broader market or one of its sectors. This information helps analysts improve there overall valuation estimate.

[[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] can be used on any [[Security|security]] with historical trading data. This includes [[Stocks|stocks]], [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Futures|futures]].asp), [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), fixed-income, currencies, and other securities. In this tutorial, we’ll usually analyze stocks in our examples, but keep in mind that these concepts can be applied to any type of security. In fact, technical analysis is far more prevalent in commodities and [forex](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp) markets where [traders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daytrader.asp) focus on short-term price movements.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] is a [[trading discipline]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/090916/top-5-books-learn-technical-analysis.asp) employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities in price trends and patterns seen on charts.
-   Technical analysts believe past trading activity and price changes of a [[Security|security]] can be valuable indicators of the security's future price movements.
-   [[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] may be contrasted with [[Fundamental Analysis|fundamental analysis]], which focuses on a company's financials rather than historical price patterns or [[Stock|stock]] trends.

#### Understanding Fundamental Vs. [[Technical Analysis]]

## The Basics Of [[Technical Analysis]]

[[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] as we know it today [[was first introduced by Charles Dow]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/10/pioneers-technical-analysis.asp) and the Dow Theory in the late 1800s.1 Several noteworthy researchers including William P. Hamilton, Robert Rhea, Edson Gould, and John Magee further contributed to Dow Theory concepts helping to form its basis. In modern day, technical analysis has evolved to included hundreds of patterns and signals developed through years of research.

[[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] operates from the assumption that past trading activity and price changes of a [[security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) can be valuable indicators of the security's future price movements when paired with appropriate investing or trading rules. Professional analysts often use technical analysis in conjunction with other forms of research. Retail traders may make decisions based solely on the price charts of a security and similar statistics, but practicing [[Equity|equity]] analysts rarely limit their research to fundamental or technical analysis alone.

Among professional analysts, the CMT Association supports the largest collection of chartered or certified analysts using [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] professionally around the world. The association's Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation can be obtained after three levels of exams that cover both a broad and deep look at technical analysis tools. Nearly one third of CMT charter holders are also Certified Financial Analyst (CFA) charter holders. This demonstrates how well the two disciplines reinforce each other.2

## The [[Underlying]] Assumptions of [[Technical Analysis]]

There are two primary methods used to analyze securities and make investment decisions: [fundamental analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) and [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] involves analyzing a company’s financial statements to determine the [[Fair Value|fair value]] of the business, while technical analysis assumes that a [[Security|security]]'s price already reflects all publicly-available information and instead focuses on the [[statistical analysis of price movements]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/logvslinear.asp). Technical analysis attempts to understand the [[Market Sentiment|market sentiment]] behind price trends by looking for patterns and trends rather than analyzing a security's fundamental attributes.

Charles Dow released a series of editorials discussing [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] theory. His writings included two basic assumptions that have continued to form the framework for technical analysis trading.

1.  Markets are efficient with values representing factors that influence a [[Security|security]]'s price, but
2.  Even random market price movements appear to move in identifiable patterns and trends that tend to repeat over time.3

Today the field of [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] builds on Dow's work. Professional analysts typically accept three general assumptions for the discipline:

### 1: The market discounts everything

Technical analysts believe that everything from a company's [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] to broad market factors to [market psychology](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketpsychology.asp) are already priced into the [[Stock|stock]]. This point of view is congruent with the [[Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp) which assumes a similar conclusion about prices. The only thing remaining is the analysis of price movements, which technical analysts view as the product of [[Supply|supply]] and demand for a particular stock in the market.4

### 2: Price moves in trends

Technical analysts expect that prices, even in random market movements, [[Will|will]] exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. In other words, a [[Stock|stock]] price is more likely to continue a past trend than move erratically. Most technical trading strategies are based on this assumption.4

### 3: History tends to repeat itself

Technical analysts believe that history tends to repeat itself. The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable based on emotions like fear or excitement. [[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] uses chart patterns to analyze these emotions and subsequent market movements to understand trends. While many forms of technical analysis have been used for more than 100 years, they are still believed to be relevant because they illustrate patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves.4

## How [[Technical Analysis]] Is Used

[[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] attempts to forecast the price movement of virtually any tradable instrument that is generally subject to forces of [[Supply|supply]] and demand, including [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, [[Futures|futures]] and currency pairs. In fact, some view technical analysis as simply the study of supply and demand forces as reflected in the market price movements of a [[Security|security]]. Technical analysis most commonly applies to price changes, but some analysts track numbers other than just price, such as trading volume or open interest figures.

Across the industry there are hundreds of patterns and signals that have been developed by researchers to support [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] trading. Technical analysts have also developed numerous types of trading systems to help them forecast and trade on price movements. Some indicators are focused primarily on identifying the current market trend, including support and resistance areas, while others are focused on determining the strength of a trend and the likelihood of its continuation. Commonly used technical indicators and charting patterns include trendlines, channels, moving averages and [[Momentum|momentum]] indicators.

In general, technical analysts look at the following broad types of indicators:

-   Price trends
-   Chart patterns
-   Volume and [[momentum]](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/[[Momentum|momentum]]-and-relative-strength-index/) indicators
-   [[Oscillators]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oscillator.asp)
-   [[Moving averages]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/10/simple-exponential-moving-averages-compare.asp)
-   Support and resistance levels

## The Difference Between [[Technical Analysis]] And [[Fundamental Analysis]]

[[Fundamental Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] and [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]], the major schools of thought when it comes to approaching the markets, are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Both methods are used for researching and forecasting future trends in [[Stock|stock]] prices, and like any investment strategy or philosophy, both have their advocates and adversaries.

[[Fundamental Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the [intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp) of a [[Stock|stock]]. Fundamental analysts study everything from the overall economy and industry conditions to the financial condition and management of companies. [Earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp), [expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp), [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) and [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liability|liability]].asp) are all important characteristics to fundamental analysts.

[[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] differs from [[Fundamental Analysis|fundamental analysis]] in that the [[Stock|stock]]'s price and volume are the only inputs. The core assumption is that all known [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] are factored into price; thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a [[Security|security]]'s intrinsic value, but instead use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that suggest what a stock [[Will|will]] do in the future.

## Limitations Of [[Technical Analysis]]

Some analysts and academic researchers expect that the EMH demonstrates why they shouldn't expect any actionable information to be contained in historical price and volume data. However, by the same reasoning, neither should business [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] provide any actionable information. These points of view are known as the weak form and semi-strong form of the EMH.

Another criticism of [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] is that history does not repeat itself exactly, so price pattern study is of dubious importance and can be ignored. Prices seem to be better modeled by assuming a random walk.

A third criticism of [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] is that it works in some cases but only because it constitutes a self-fulfilling prophesy. For example, many technical traders [[Will|will]] place a [stop-loss order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) below the 200-day moving average of a certain company. If a large number of traders have done so and the [[Stock|stock]] reaches this price, there will be a large number of sell orders, which will push the stock down, confirming the movement traders anticipated.

Then, other traders [[Will|will]] see the price decrease and also sell their positions, reinforcing the strength of the trend. This short-term selling pressure can be considered self-fulfilling, but it will have little bearing on where the asset's price will be weeks or months from now. In sum, if enough people use the same signals, they could cause the movement foretold by the signal, but over the long run this sole group of traders cannot drive price.
