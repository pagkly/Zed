[[What Is a Y-Share]]?
## [[What Is a Y-Share]]?

[[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] are an [[institutional share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalshares.asp) class offered in open-end mutual funds. Targeting institutional investors, the share class often has a high minimum investment, beginning at approximately $25,000. This share class also offers the benefit of waived or limited load charges and lower comparative total annual fees.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Y]]-share is an institutional share class offered in open-end mutual funds—having a high minimum investment—generally $25,000 or more.
-   These [[Shares|shares]] [[Offer|offer]] a limited or waived load charge or lower comparative total annual fee.
-   [[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] are not associated with intermediary sales charges and usually do not pay any distribution fees or 12b-1 fees from the fund’s expenses, allowing their expense ratios to be lower overall than other share classes.
-   While [[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] are typically reserved for institutional investors, they may allow investment from retirement plan investors in some cases.
-   Funds without retirement share classes may allow pooled fund investments in [[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] from retirement plans that collectively seek investment in the fund.

## How [[Y]]-[[Shares]] Work

[[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] are an alternative to [[I-shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalshares.asp) which are in the most commonly offered mutual fund share class for [[institutional investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp). Y-shares have features and characteristics that are tailored to institutions.

High minimum investments are one of the most distinguishable characteristics of [[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] and other institutional shares classes. Minimum investments typically begin at $25,000 and can be as high as $5 million. Sales loads are usually not required for Y-shares, which allows institutional investors to buy and sell shares with no added [[Commission|commission]] charges.

Since [[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] are not associated with intermediary sales charges, they also usually do not pay any distribution fees or [12b-1 fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/12b-1fees.asp) from the fund’s expenses. Without 12b-1 fees, the total expense ratios are lower overall than other share classes in the fund, which is another benefit for institutional investors.

## Special Considerations

While [[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] are typically reserved for institutional investors, they may allow investment from retirement plan investors in some cases. Most [[mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) [[Will|will]] have designated retirement share classes with similar benefits to institutional shares.

Funds without retirement share classes may allow pooled fund investments in [[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] from retirement plans that collectively seek investment in the fund. This can provide a significant benefit to retirement shareholders, who would take part in the savings from the share class’s lower fees.

## Example of [[Y]]-[[Shares]]

Putnam Investments is one investment manager that offers [[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] across many of its funds as the primary share class for institutional investors. The [[Putnam Global Equity Fund]](https://www.putnam.com/individual/mutual-funds/funds/36-global-[[Equity|equity]]-fund/A) provides one example. The Fund offers [[A-shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/a-shares.asp), B-shares, C-shares, M-shares, R-shares, R6-shares, T-shares, and Y-shares.

The Putnam Global [[Equity Fund]]’s [[Y]]-share class charges no front-end or back-end sales commissions. The share class also charges no 12b-1 fees, which helps it to have one of the lowest annual expense ratios in the Fund at 0.90%. This compares to total annual fund operating expenses of 1.9% for the B-[[Shares|shares]] and C-shares.

Performance for the [[Y]]-[[Shares|shares]] as of March 30, 2020, was also one of the highest in the Fund for the last five years at 5.81%.
