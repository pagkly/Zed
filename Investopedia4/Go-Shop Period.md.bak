[[Go-Shop Period]]
## What Is a [[Go-Shop Period]]?

A [[Go-Shop Period|go-shop period]] is a provision that allows a [[public company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp) to seek out competing offers even after it has already received a firm purchase [[Offer|offer]]. The original offer then functions as a floor for possible better offers. The duration of a go-shop period is usually about one to two months. 

### Key Takeaways

-   Go-shop periods are a timeframe, generally one to two months, where a company being acquired can shop itself for a better deal. 
-   Go-shop provisions generally allow the initial bidder to match any competing offers, and if the company is sold to another buyer they are generally paid a breakup fee.
-   A no-shop provision means the company can't actively shop the deal, which includes [[Offering|offering]] information to potential buyers or soliciting other proposals. 

## How a [[Go-Shop Period]] Works

A [[Go-Shop Period|go-shop period]] is meant to help a board of directors fulfill its [[fiduciary]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Fiduciary|fiduciary]].asp) duty to shareholders and find the best deal possible. Go-shop agreements usually give the initial bidder the opportunity to match any better [[Offer|offer]] the target company receives. They also pay the initial bidder a reduced [[breakup fee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakfee.asp) if the target company is purchased by another suitor.

In an active [[mergers and acquisitions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) (M&A) environment, it may be reasonable to believe that other bidders may come forward. However, critics say go-shop periods are cosmetic, designed to give the board of directors the appearance of acting in the best interests of shareholders. Critics note that go-shop periods rarely result in additional offers, because they don't give other potential buyers enough time to perform due diligence on the target company. Historical data suggests a very small fraction of initial bids are cast aside in favor of new bids during go-shop periods.1

## Go-Shop vs. No-Shop 

A [[Go-Shop Period|go-shop period]] allows the company being acquired to shop around for a better [[Offer|offer]]. The no-shop period affords the [[acquiree]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquiree.asp) no such option. In the case of a no-shop provision, the company being acquired would have to pay a hefty breakup fee if it decides to sell to another company after the offer is made. 

In 2016, Microsoft announced it would buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion.2 The tentative agreement between the two had a no-shop provision. If LinkedIn found another buyer it would have to pay Microsoft a $725 million breakup fee.3 

No-shop provisions mean the company can't actively shop the deal—that is, the company cannot [[Offer|offer]] information to potential buyers, initiate conversations with buyers, or solicit proposals, among other things. However, companies can respond to unsolicited offers as part of their [[Fiduciary|fiduciary]] duty. The status quo in many M&A deals is to have a no-shop provision. 

## Criticism of Go-Shop Periods 

A [[Go-Shop Period|go-shop period]] generally appears when the selling company is private and the buyer is an investment firm, such as private [[Equity|equity]]. They are also becoming more popular with go-private transactions, where a public company [[Will|will]] sell via a [[leveraged buyout]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp) (LBO). However, a go-shop period rarely leads to another buyer coming in.
