[[Risk-Adjusted Return Definition]]
## What Is a [[Risk]]-Adjusted [[Return]]?

A [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted [[Return|return]] is a calculation of the [[profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp) or potential profit from an investment that takes into account the degree of risk that must be accepted in order to achieve it. The risk is measured in comparison to that of a virtually risk-free investment—usually U.S. [[Treasuries]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/073113/introduction-treasury-securities.asp).

Depending on the method used, the [[risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]].asp) calculation is expressed as a number or a [[Rating|rating]]. Risk-adjusted returns are applied to individual [[Stocks|stocks]], investment funds, and entire [[portfolios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted [[Return|return]] measures an investment's return after taking into account the degree of risk that was taken to achieve it.
-   There are several methods of [[Risk|risk]]-adjusting performance, such as the Sharpe ratio and Treynor ratio, with each yielding a slightly different result.
-   In any case, the purpose of [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted [[Return|return]] is to help investors determine whether the risk taken was worth the expected reward.

## Understanding [[Risk]]-Adjusted [[Return]]

The [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted [[Return|return]] measures the profit your investment has made relative to the amount of risk the investment has represented throughout a given period of time. If two or more [[investments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp) delivered the same [[return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp) over a given time period, the one that has the lowest risk [[Will|will]] have a better risk-adjusted return.

Some common [[Risk|risk]] measures used in investing include [[alpha]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp), [[beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp), [[R-squared]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[R-Squared|r-squared]].asp), [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]], and the Sharpe ratio. When comparing two or more potential investments, an investor should apply the same risk measure to each investment under consideration in order to get a relative performance perspective.

Different [[Risk|risk]] measurements give investors very different analytical results, so it is important to be clear on what type of risk-adjusted [[Return|return]] is being considered.

## Examples of [[Risk]]-Adjusted [[Return]] Methods

### Sharpe Ratio

The [[Sharpe ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) measures the profit of an investment that exceeds the [[risk-free rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]]-freerate.asp), per unit of [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]]. It is calculated by taking the [[Return|return]] of the investment, subtracting the risk-free rate, and dividing this result by the investment's standard deviation.

All else equal, a higher Sharpe ratio is better. The [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) shows the [[Volatility|volatility]] of an investment's returns relative to its average [[Return|return]], with greater standard deviations reflecting wider returns, and narrower standard deviations implying more concentrated returns. The [[Risk|risk]]-free rate used is the [[yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/[[Yield|yield]].asp) on a no-risk investment, such as a [[Treasury Bond (T-Bond)|Treasury bond (T-bond)]], for the relevant period of time.

For example, say Mutual Fund A returned 12% over the past year and had a [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of 10%, Mutual Fund B returns 10% and had a standard deviation of 7%, and the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate over the time period was 3%. The Sharpe ratios would be calculated as follows:

-   Mutual Fund A: (12% - 3%) / 10% = 0.9
-   Mutual Fund B: (10% - 3%) / 7% = 1

Even though Mutual Fund A had a higher [[Return|return]], Mutual Fund B had a higher [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted return, meaning that it gained more per unit of total risk than Mutual Fund A.

### Treynor Ratio

The [[Treynor ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treynorratio.asp) is calculated the same way as the Sharpe ratio, but uses the investment's [[beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) in the denominator. As is the case with the Sharpe, a higher Treynor ratio is better.

Using the previous fund example, and assuming that each of the funds has a beta of 0.75, the calculations are as follows:

-   Mutual Fund A: (12% - 3%) / 0.75 = 0.12
-   Mutual Fund B: (10% - 3%) / 0.75 = 0.09

Here, Mutual Fund A has a higher Treynor ratio, meaning that the fund is earning more [[Return|return]] per unit of [[systematic risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp) than Fund B.

## Special Considerations

[[Risk]] avoidance is not always a good thing in investing, so be wary of over-reacting to these numbers, especially if the timeline being measured is short. In strong markets, a [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) with a lower risk than its [[benchmark]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) can limit the real performance that the investor wants to see.

Beware of over-reacting to these numbers, especially if the timeline being measured is short. Greater risks can mean greater rewards over the long-term.

A fund that entertains more [[Risk|risk]] than its benchmark may experience better returns. In fact, it has been shown many times that higher-risk mutual funds may accrue greater losses during [[volatile]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) periods, but are also likely to [[Outperform|outperform]] their benchmarks over full [[market cycles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market_cycles.asp).
