[[Value at Risk (VaR) Explained]]
## [[What Is Value]] at [[Risk]] (VaR)?

Value at [[Risk|risk]] (VaR) is a statistic that measures and quantifies the level of financial risk within a firm, [[Portfolio|portfolio]] or position over a specific time frame. This metric is most commonly used by investment and [[commercial banks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialbank.asp) to determine the extent and occurrence ratio of potential losses in their institutional portfolios.

[[Risk]] managers use VaR to measure and control the level of risk exposure. One can apply VaR [[calculations]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/how-can-you-calculate-value-risk-var-excel.asp) to specific positions or whole portfolios or to measure firm-wide risk exposure.

## Understanding Value at [[Risk]] (VaR)

VaR modeling determines the potential for loss in the entity being assessed and the probability of occurrence for the defined loss. One measures VaR by assessing the amount of potential loss, the probability of occurrence for the amount of loss, and the timeframe.

For example, a financial firm may determine an asset has a 3% one-month VaR of 2%, representing a 3% chance of the asset declining in value by 2% during the one-month time frame. The conversion of the 3% chance of occurrence to a daily ratio places the odds of a 2% loss at one day per month.

Investment banks commonly apply VaR modeling to firm-wide [[Risk|risk]] due to the potential for independent trading desks to unintentionally expose the firm to highly correlated assets.

Using a firm-wide VaR assessment allows for the determination of the cumulative risks from aggregated positions held by different trading desks and departments within the institution. Using the data provided by VaR modeling, financial institutions can determine whether they have sufficient capital reserves in place to cover losses or whether higher-than-acceptable risks require them to reduce concentrated [[Holdings|holdings]].

## Example of Problems with Value at [[Risk]] (VaR) Calculations

There is no standard protocol for the statistics used to determine asset, [[Portfolio|portfolio]] or firm-wide [[Risk|risk]]. For example, statistics pulled arbitrarily from a period of low [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) may understate the potential for risk events to occur and the magnitude of those events. Risk may be further understated using [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] probabilities, which rarely account for extreme or black-swan events.

The assessment of potential loss represents the lowest amount of [[Risk|risk]] in a range of outcomes. For example, a VaR determination of 95% with 20% asset risk represents an expectation of losing at least 20% one of every 20 days on average. In this calculation, a loss of 50% still validates the [[Risk Assessment|risk assessment]].

The [[financial crisis of 2008]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/09/financial-crisis-review.asp) that exposed these problems as relatively benign VaR calculations understated the potential occurrence of [[Risk|risk]] events posed by portfolios of subprime mortgages. Risk magnitude was also underestimated, which resulted in extreme [[Leverage|leverage]] ratios within subprime portfolios. As a result, the underestimations of occurrence and risk magnitude left institutions unable to cover billions of dollars in losses as subprime mortgage values collapsed.1
