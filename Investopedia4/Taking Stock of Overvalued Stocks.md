[[Taking Stock of Overvalued Stocks]]
## What Is "Overvalued"?

An overvalued [[Stock|stock]] has a current price that is not justified by its [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) outlook, known as profit projections, or its [[price-earnings (P/E) ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp). Consequently, analysts and other economic experts expect the price to drop eventually.

### Key Takeaways:

-   An overvalued [[Stock|stock]] has a current price that is not justified by its [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) outlook, typically assessed by its P/E ratio.
-   A company is considered overvalued if it trades at a rate that is unjustifiably and significantly in excess of its peers.
-   Overvalued [[Stocks|stocks]] are sought by investors looking to short positions and capitalize on anticipated price declines.

Overvaluation may result from an uptick in emotional trading, or illogical, gut-driven decision making that artificially inflates the [[Stock|stock]]'s [[market price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp). Overvaluation can also occur due to deterioration in a company's [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] and financial strength. Potential investors strive to avoid overpaying for [[Stocks|stocks]].

The most popular valuation metric for publicly traded companies is the P/E ratio, which analyzes a company's [[Stock|stock]] price relative to its earnings. An overvalued company trades at an unjustifiably rich level compared to its peers.

## Understanding Overvalued [[Stocks]]

A small group of market theorists believes that the market is [[perfectly efficient]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp), by nature. They opine that [[fundamental analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) of a [[Stock|stock]] is a pointless exercise because the stock market is all-knowing. Therefore, [[Stocks|stocks]] may neither be truly undervalued or overvalued. Contrarily, fundamental analysts are staunch in their belief that there are always opportunities to ferret out undervalued and overvalued stocks because the market is as irrational as its participants.

Overvalued [[Stocks|stocks]] are ideal for investors looking to [[short a position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp). This entails selling [[Shares|shares]] to capitalize on an anticipated price declines. Investors may also legitimately trade overvalued stocks at a [[Premium|premium]] due to the brand, superior management, or other factors that increase the value of one company's earnings over another.

## How to Find Overvalued [[Stocks]]

Relative earnings analysis is the most common way to identify an overvalued [[Stock|stock]]. This metric compares earnings to some comparable market value, such as price. The most popular comparison is the [[P/E ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp), which analyzes a company's stock price relative to its earnings.

Analysts looking for [[Stocks|stocks]] to short may seek overvalued companies with high P/E ratios, particularly when compared to other companies in the same sector or [[peer group]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peer-group.asp). For example, assume a company has a [[Stock|stock]] price of $100 and [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) of $2. The calculation of its P/E ratio is determined by dividing the price by the earnings ($100/$2 = 50). So, in this example, the [[Security|security]] is trading at 50 times earnings.

If that same company has a banner year and makes $10 in EPS, the new P/E ratio is $100 divided by $10, or 10 times ($100/$10 = 10). Most people would consider the company to be overvalued at a P/E of 50, but possibly undervalued at 10.

## Real World Example

Although by definition, a [[Stock|stock]] is overvalued only by the opinion of an analyst, The Motley Fool website is never shy about weighing in. For example, they deemed the pharma giant [[Ely Lilly]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/30/is-eli-lilly-stock-overvalued.aspx) to be overvalued because the company's valuation reached "untenable levels following the company's meteoric rise during the tail end of 2019 and early days of 2020."

According to The Motley Fool, in January 2020, the company's [[Stock|stock]] was the second most expensive among its industry peers and Eli Lilly might find it hard to deliver consistent expected growth.
