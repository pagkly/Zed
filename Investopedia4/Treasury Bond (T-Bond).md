[[Treasury Bond (T-Bond)]]
## What Is a [[Treasury Bond (T-Bond)]]?

Treasury bonds (T-bonds) are [[government debt securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp) issued by the U.S. Federal government that have [[maturities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp) greater than 20 years. T-bonds earn periodic interest until maturity, at which point the owner is also paid a par amount equal to the [[Principal|principal]].

Treasury bonds are part of the larger category of U.S. [[sovereign debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-[[Debt|debt]].asp) known collectively as treasuries, which are typically regarded as virtually [[Risk|risk]]-free since they are backed by the U.S. government's ability to tax its citizens.

### Key Takeaways

-   Treasury bonds (T-bonds) are fixed-rate U.S. government [[Debt|debt]] securities with a maturity range between 10 and 30 years.
-   T-bonds pay semiannual interest payments until maturity, at which point the face value of the bond is paid to the owner.
-   Along with Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), Treasury bonds are one of four virtually [[Risk|risk]]-free government-issued securities.

## Understanding Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)

Treasury bonds (T-bonds) are one of four types of [[Debt|debt]] issued by the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp) to [[Finance|finance]] the U.S. government’s spending activities. The four types of debt are Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and [[Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp). These securities vary by maturity and coupon payments.

All of them are considered benchmarks to their comparable fixed-income categories because they are virtually [[Risk|risk]]-free. T-bonds are backed by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government can raise taxes and increase revenue to ensure full payments. These investments are also considered benchmarks in their respective fixed-income categories because they [[Offer|offer]] a base risk-free rate of investment with the categories' lowest [[Return|return]]. T-bonds have long [[durations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp), issued with maturities of between 20 and 30 years.

As is true for other government bonds, T-bonds make interest payments semiannually, and the income received is only taxed at the federal level. Treasury bonds are issued at monthly online auctions held directly by the U.S. Treasury. A bond's price and its [[Yield|yield]] are determined during the auction. After that, T-bonds are traded actively in the secondary market and can be purchased through a bank or broker.

Individual investors often use T-bonds to keep a portion of their retirement savings [[Risk|risk]]-free, to provide a steady income in retirement, or to set aside savings for a child's education or other major expenses. Investors must [[Hold|hold]] their T-bonds for a minimum of 45 days before they can be sold on the secondary market.1

## Special Considerations

### Treasury Bond Maturity Ranges

Treasury bonds are issued with maturities that can range from 20 to 30 years. They are issued with a minimum [[denomination]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/denomination.asp) of $100, and coupon payments on the bonds are paid semiannually. The bonds are initially sold through an auction; the maximum purchase amount is $5 million if the bid is noncompetitive (or 35% of the [[Offering|offering]] if the bid is competitive).2 A [[competitive bid]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitivebid.asp) states the rate the bidder is willing to accept; it is accepted depending on how it compares with the set rate of the bond. A noncompetitive bid ensures the bidder gets the bond, but they have to accept the set rate. After the auction, the bonds can be sold in the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp).

### The Treasury Bond Secondary Market

There is an active secondary market for T-bonds, making the investments highly [[liquid]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp). The secondary market also makes the price of T-bonds fluctuate considerably in the trading market. As such, current auction and [[Yield|yield]] rates of T-bonds dictate their pricing levels on the secondary market. Similar to other types of bonds, T-bonds on the secondary market see prices go down when auction rates increase because the value of the bond’s future cash flows is discounted at the higher rate. Inversely, when prices increase, auction rate yields decrease.

### Treasury Bond Yields

In the [[fixed-income market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp), T-bond yields help to form the [[Yield Curve|yield curve]], which includes the full range of investments offered by the U.S. government. The [[yield curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldcurve.asp) diagrams [[Yield|yield]] by maturity, and it is most often upward sloping (with lower maturities [[Offering|offering]] lower rates than longer-dated maturities). However, the yield curve can become inverted when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates. An inverted yield curve can signal an upcoming recession.
