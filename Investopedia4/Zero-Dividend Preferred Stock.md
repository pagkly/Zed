Preferred stock has priority over [[Common Stock|common stock]] when it comes to dividends and asset distribution and is therefore seen as less risky. Preferred stock usually does not have [[voting rights]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp), whereas common stock does.

Owners of zero-dividend [[preference shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preference-[[Shares|shares]].asp) [[Will|will]] not receive a normal dividend but they will still maintain [[Reimbursement|reimbursement]] priority over [[common shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common_shareholder.asp) in the event of a bankruptcy. In such an event, they will get a fixed sum that was agreed upon in advance.
