## What Is a Judgment [[Lien]]?

A judgment [[Lien|lien]] is a court ruling that gives a [[creditor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) the right to take possession of a [[debtor's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debtor|debtor]].asp) real or [[Personal Property|personal property]] if the debtor fails to fulfill his or her contractual obligations. This lien may be made against an individual or business and allows the creditor to access assets such as the debtor's business, personal property, and real [[Estate|estate]] to satisfy the judgment.

A plaintiff who obtains a monetary judgment is described as a judgment [[Creditor|creditor]], while the defendant becomes a judgment [[Debtor|debtor]].

### Key Takeaways

-   A judgment [[Lien|lien]] is a court ruling that gives a [[Creditor|creditor]] the right to take possession of a [[Debtor|debtor]]'s property if the debtor fails to fulfill his or her contractual obligations.
-   Judgment liens are nonconsensual because they are attached to property without the owner's consent or agreement.
-   Creditors must record liens via a county or state filing in most states.
-   These liens can be attached to real or [[Personal Property|personal property]], or—if the [[Debtor|debtor]] has none at the time of judgment—to future acquisitions.

## Understanding Judgment Liens

If you owe money to a [[Creditor|creditor]] and don't pay, that party may sue you for the balance. If the court rules against you, the creditor can file a judgment [[Lien|lien]] against you. A judgment lien is considered a nonconsensual [[lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp). That's because it is attached to a piece of property without the owner's consent or agreement.

In most states, the judgment [[Creditor|creditor]]—the winner of the lawsuit—must record the [[Lien|lien]] via a county or state filing. In a few states, if a court enters a judgment against a [[Debtor|debtor]], a lien is automatically created on any real [[Estate|estate]] the debtor owns in that county.

Once a judgment [[Lien|lien]] is filed with the appropriate authority, it becomes attached to any personal or [[Real Property|real property]]. [[Personal property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalproperty.asp) refers to assets such as cars, appliances, or furniture. [[Real property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-property.asp), on the other hand, refers to things like homes and other buildings, or land. The property must be registered in your name, so if you have a [[Debt|debt]] that goes unpaid, the judgment lien cannot be attached to your spouse's property. If you do not own any property at the time the lien is filed, it can be attached to any future acquisitions—provided the lien doesn't expire.

One downfall to liens on [[Personal Property|personal property]] is that a large portion of personal property has no title. Therefore, liens are not officially recorded, and personal property could be sold off to a [[Third Party|third party]] who is unaware of the [[Lien|lien]]’s existence.

In most states, judgment liens must be filed by the [[Creditor|creditor]] through the county or state.

## Special Considerations

There are a few ways you can satisfy or avoid a [[Lien|lien]] altogether. The first—and most obvious—option is to repay the [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp). If you pay off your obligation, the [[Creditor|creditor]] [[Will|will]] remove the lien. This is done by filing a release through the same place the lien was recorded—the county or state.

It is possible for you to avoid a nonconsensual judgment [[Lien|lien]] on a property or vehicle in [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp)—deemed lien avoidance—if the following conditions [[Hold|hold]] true:

-   The [[Lien|lien]] must have been derived from a court-issued money judgment.
-   The judgment [[Debtor|debtor]] must be entitled to claim an exemption in at least some of his or her [[Equity|equity]] in the property.
-   The [[Lien|lien]] would result in a loss of some or all of this exempt [[Equity|equity]] if the real [[Estate|estate]] or vehicle was sold.

Using [[Lien|lien]] avoidance can be an advantage if and when available. This can be particularly beneficial if a lien can be fully wiped out, although still helpful in the case of partial lien avoidance.

## Judgment Liens vs. Property Liens

While judgment liens are awarded by courts without the consent of the [[Debtor|debtor]], [[property liens]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property-[[Lien|lien]].asp) are a little different. These liens are permitted by the debtor, who voluntarily gives up the right to his or her property. If you borrow a large sum of money—say for a mortgage or a car—the [[Lender|lender]] may require a form of [[Security|security]] or [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp). That's because the financial [[Risk|risk]] is too high. In order to complete and fund the [[Loan|loan]], the [[Creditor|creditor]] may put a lien on your property. By doing so, the creditor ensures it can [[foreclose]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp) on that piece of property if you [[Default|default]] on your financial obligation.

## Examples of Judgment Liens

If one person injures another in an accident through negligence, the injured person may decide to sue for damages. If the person affecting the accident’s insurance does not cover the injured party’s required reparations, a judgment [[Lien|lien]] may be placed against the negligent person's property. The creation of this judgment lien secures payment of the claim. If the [[Debt|debt]] is not paid, the judgment [[Creditor|creditor]] has the authority to take additional steps. These could include seeking enforcement of the judgment by [[garnishing wages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/[[Garnishment|garnishment]].asp) and potentially seizing a bank account.

Here's another example. A judge may place a [[Lien|lien]] on a [[Debtor|debtor]]'s car for nonpayment of a car [[Loan|loan]]. In this scenario, if the debtor does not pay his or her [[Creditor|creditor]] within a certain time period, the car would be used to pay off the remaining [[Debt|debt]]. If there's a balance left over, the debtor is on the hook for that. This example extends to trucks, motorcycles, or other motor vehicles.
