[[Target-Date Fund]]
## What Is a [[Target-Date Fund]]?

Target-date funds are mutual fund or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) structured to grow assets in a way that is optimized for a specific time frame. The structuring of these funds addresses an investor's capital needs at some future date—hence, the name "target date." Most often, investors [[Will|will]] use a target date fund to apply to their onset of retirement. However, target-date funds are more frequently being used by investors working towards a future expense, such as a child's college tuition.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Target-Date Fund|target-date fund]] is a class of mutual funds or ETFs that periodically rebalances asset class weights to optimize [[Risk|risk]] and returns for predetermined time frame.
-   The asset allocation of a [[Target-Date Fund|target-date fund]] is typically designed to gradually shift to a more conservative profile so as to minimize [[Risk|risk]] when the target date approaches.
-   The appeal of target-date funds is that they [[Offer|offer]] investors the convenience of putting their investing activities on autopilot in one vehicle.

#### Who Actually Benefits From Target-Date Funds?

## How a [[Target-Date Fund]] Works

Target date funds use a traditional [[Portfolio|portfolio]] management methodology to target [[asset allocation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp) over the term of the fund to meet the investment [[Return|return]] objective. Named by the year in which the investor plans to begin utilizing the assets, target-date funds are considered to be extremely long-term investments. For example, in July 2017, Vanguard launched its [[Target Retirement 2065 products]](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/). Given that the funds have a targeted utilization date of 2065 that gives them a time horizon of 48 years.

A fund's [[Portfolio|portfolio]] managers use this predetermined time horizon to fashion their investment strategy, generally based on traditional asset allocation models. The fund managers also use the target date to determine the degree of [[Risk|risk]] the fund is willing to undertake. Target-date portfolio managers typically readjust portfolio risk levels annually.

## Special Considerations

Following the initial launch, a [[Target-Date Fund|target-date fund]] has a high tolerance for [[Risk|risk]] and therefore is more heavily [[Weighted|weighted]] toward high-performing but speculative assets. At the annual adjustment, [[Portfolio|portfolio]] managers [[Will|will]] reset the allocation of investment categories.

A [[Target-Date Fund|target-date fund]]’s [[Portfolio|portfolio]] mix of assets and degree of [[Risk|risk]] become more conservative as it approaches its objective target date. Higher risk portfolio investments typically include domestic and global equities. Lower risk portions of a target-date portfolio typically include fixed-income investments such as bonds and [cash equivalents](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashequivalents.asp).

Most fund marketing materials show the allocation [[Glide Path|glide path]]—that is, the shift of assets—across the entire investment time horizon. The funds structure their glide rate to achieve the most conservative allocation right at the specified target date.

Some target-date funds, known as [“through” funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/through-fund.asp) (To funds) [[Will|will]] also manage funds to a specified asset allocation past the target date. In the years beyond the target date, allocations are more heavily [[Weighted|weighted]] toward low-[[Risk|risk]], fixed income investments.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Target-Date Funds

### Advantages

Target-date funds are popular with [401(k) plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) investors. Instead of having to choose several investments to create a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] that [[Will|will]] help them reach their retirement goals, investors choose a single [[Target-Date Fund|target-date fund]] to match their time horizon. For example, a younger worker hoping to retire in 2065 would choose a target-date 2065 fund, while an older worker hoping to retire in 2025 would choose a target-date 2025 fund.

These funds mitigate the need for other assets. Some financial professionals advise that if you invest in one, it should be the only investment in your plan. This one-and-done approach is because additional investments could skew your overall [[Portfolio|portfolio]] allocation. However, after you've picked a fund, you have the ultimate set-it-and-forget-it investment.

### Disadvantages

Of course, the autopilot nature of target-date funds can cut both ways. The predetermined shifting of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] assets may not suit an individual's changing goals and needs. People grow and change, and so do their needs.

What if you have to retire substantially earlier than the target date—or decide you want to keep working longer? Also, there is no guarantee that the fund's earnings [[Will|will]] keep up with inflation. In fact, there are no guarantees that the fund will generate a certain amount of income or gains at all. A [[Target-Date Fund|target-date fund]] is an investment, not an annuity. As with all investments, these funds are subject to [[Risk|risk]] and underperformance.

Furthermore, as investments go, target-date funds can be expensive. They are technically a [[fund of funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp) (FoF)—a fund that invests in other mutual funds or exchange-traded funds—which means you have to pay the expense ratios of those [[Underlying|underlying]] assets, as well as the fees of the [[Target-Date Fund|target-date fund]].

Of course, an increasing number of funds are no-load, and overall, fee rates have been decreasing. Still, it is something to watch out for, especially if your fund invests in a lot of passively managed vehicles. Why pay double fees on [[index funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/082515/index-or-target-date-funds-401ks-which-better-vfinx-fusex.asp), when you could buy and [[Hold|hold]] them on your own?

Also, it's worth bearing in mind that similarly named target-date funds are not the same—or, more specifically, their assets are not the same. Yes, all 2045 target-dated funds [[Will|will]] be heavily [[Weighted|weighted]] toward equities, but some might opt for domestic [[Stocks|stocks]], while others look to international stocks. Some might go for investment-grade bonds, and others choose high-[[Yield|yield]], lower-grade [[Debt|debt]] instruments. Make sure the fund's [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of assets fit your comfort level and own appetite for [[Risk|risk]].

Pros

-   The ultimate autopilot way to invest
    
-   All-in-one vehicle—no need for other assets
    
-   A diversified [[Portfolio|portfolio]]
    

Cons

-   Higher expenses than other passive investments
    
-   Income not guaranteed
    
-   Possibly insufficient inflation [[Hedge|hedge]]
    
-   Little room for changing investor goals, needs
    

## Example of Target-Date Funds

Vanguard is one investment manager [[Offering|offering]] a comprehensive series of target-date funds. Below we compare the characteristics of the Vanguard 2065 (VLXVX) fund to the characteristics of the Vanguard 2025 fund.

The Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Fund has an expense ratio of 0.15%. As of Feb. 20, 2021, the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] allocation was 90% in [[Stocks|stocks]] and 10% in bonds. It had 53.6% invested in the Vanguard Total [[Stock]] [[Market Index]], 36.4% invested in the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, 7.2% invested in the Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, and 2.8% invested in the Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund.1

The Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 Fund (VTTVX) has an expense ratio of 0.13%. The [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is [[Weighted|weighted]] 59.2% in [[Stocks|stocks]] and 40% in bonds. It has allocated 35.4% of assets to the Vanguard Total [[Stock]] [[Market Index]] Fund, 28% to the Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, 23.8% to the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, 12% to the Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund, and 0.80% to the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation Protected Securities Index Fund.2

Both funds invest in the same assets. However, the 2065 Fund is more heavily [[Weighted|weighted]] toward [[Stocks|stocks]], with a relatively smaller percentage of bonds and [[Cash Equivalents|cash equivalents]]. The 2025 Fund has greater weight in fixed income and fewer stocks, so it is less volatile and more likely to contain the assets the investor needs to begin making withdrawals in 2025.12

In the years beyond the target date, both Vanguard target-date funds report an asset allocation mix of approximately 20% in U.S. equities, 10% in international equities, 40% in U.S. bonds, 10% in international bonds, and about 20% in short-term TIPS.12
