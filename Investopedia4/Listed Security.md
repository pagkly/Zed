[[Listed Security]]
## What Is a [[Listed Security]]?

A [[Listed Security|listed security]] is a [[financial instrument]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp) that is traded through an exchange, such as the NYSE or [[Nasdaq]]. When a private company decides to go public and issue [[Shares|shares]], it [[Will|will]] need to choose an exchange on which to be [[Listed|listed]]. To do so, it must be able to meet that exchange's listing requirements and pay both the exchange's entry and yearly listing fees. Listing requirements vary by exchange and include minimum stockholder's [[Equity|equity]], a minimum share price, and a minimum number of shareholders. Exchanges have listing requirements to ensure that only high-quality securities are traded on them and to uphold the exchange's reputation among investors.

## [[Listed Security]] Definition

Becoming a [[Listed|listed]] company on the [[Nasdaq]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/[[Nasdaq|nasdaq]].asp) is considerably less expensive than listing on the [[NYSE]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp), so newer companies often opt for the Nasdaq if they meet its requirements. The exchange a company chooses to be listed on can affect how investors perceive the [[Stock|stock]]. Some companies choose to cross-list their securities on more than one exchange.

If a [[Stock|stock]] fails to comply with the exchange's listing requirements, it [[Will|will]] be delisted. Delisted securities that can no longer be traded on an exchange will sometimes be traded over the counter. The [[over-the-counter market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/over-the-countermarket.asp) does not have listing requirements.

## Requirements to Become a [[Listed]] Company on [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]]

Each company that lists on the [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] must put up a minimum of 1,250,000 publicly traded [[Shares|shares]] for sale to the public, excluding those shares held by officers, directors, or any [beneficial owners](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficialowner.asp). In addition, the regular bid price at time of listing must be at least $4.00, and there must be at least three to four [market makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) for the [[Stock|stock]].1

However, a company may qualify under a [closing price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp) alternative of $3.00 or $2.00 if the company meets other certain metrics. Companies must also have at least 450 [round lot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roundlot.asp) (100 [[Shares|shares]]) shareholders, 2,200 total shareholders, or 550 total shareholders with 1.1 million average trading volume over the past 12 months.2

## Requirements to Become a [[Listed]] Company on NYSE

To get [[Listed|listed]] on NYSE, a corporation needs at least 400 round-lot holders, or stockholders, with 100 [[Shares|shares]] apiece. The company must also have at least 1.1 million outstanding shares worth $40 million or more, and a price-per-share can be no lower than $4. If a new listing is an [[IPO]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp), the NYSE requires a guarantee from the IPO underwriter that the IPO [[Will|will]] meet the board's standards.3 

The earnings test for a new NYSE listing requires a minimum $100 million total earnings for the previous three years. Valuation with [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] requires capitalization – the value of the outstanding [[Stock|stock]] – of $500 million and an aggregate $25 million cash flow for the past two years. Pure valuation requires a $750 million capitalization and revenue of $75 million in the most recent fiscal year. An affiliate of an established NYSE listing only needs $500 million in capitalization and a year in existence as a company.4
