[[Listed Option Definition]]
## What is a [[Listed]] Option?

A [[Listed|listed]] option, or exchange-traded option, is a type of [[derivative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) [[Security|security]] traded on a registered exchange. Listed options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific amount of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset at a fixed price by a particular date. Unlike [over-the-counter options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcoptions.asp) (OTC), they have standardized strike prices, expiration dates, settlements, and clearing.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Listed|listed]] option is a [[Derivative|derivative]] [[Security|security]] traded on a registered exchange with standardized strike prices, expiration dates, settlements, and clearing.
-   There are two types of [[Listed|listed]] options, namely American style and European style.
-   [[Listed]] options, both puts and calls, provide traders the opportunity to speculate on the direction of movement in the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] with a much more significant level of safety.

## Understanding [[Listed]] Options

A [[Listed|listed]] option, also known as an exchange-traded option, is one that is offered on a national exchange such as [[New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE) or [[Chicago Board of Trade]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cbot.asp) (CBOT). They cover securities such as common [[Stocks|stocks]], [[exchange-traded funds (ETFs)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp), market indexes, [[currencies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/i/international-currency-markets.asp), [[fixed income securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp), and [[commodities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp). Unlike warrants, traders may write, or create, options on the [[Underlying|underlying]] securities. The secondary market is active, unlike the exchange for warrants.

Many [[options contracts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) are sold [[over-the-counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC), with the main advantage of complete customization to the terms. However, this market is [[illiquid]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp) in most situations and has a higher [[Risk|risk]] that one party, either the buyer or seller, may not honor the obligations of the deal.

However, for most investors and traders, [[Listed|listed]] options provide a sufficient vehicle with a much more significant level of safety. The [[exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp) acts as a middleman, taking the other side of the trade and providing [[clearing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearing.asp) and settlement services, either directly or through a [[Third Party|third party]].

There are two types of [[Listed|listed]] options. These styles are the [American style](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/americanoption.asp) and the [European style](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanoption.asp). The primary difference between the two is the date of execution. With American style options, they may be exercised at any time up to the [[expiration date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expiration-date.asp). Conversely, with European style options, they may only be exercised at the expiration date. However, traders and investors may sell their long positions or buy back their short standing at any time to exit the trade before expiration. Most options found on the national exchanges are in the American style.

[[Listed]] options, both [[puts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) and [[calls]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), provide traders the opportunity to speculate on the direction of movement in the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]], but with a lower initial cost. Options strategies are possibly able to limit [[Risk|risk]] and profit no matter which way the underlying security moves, if at all. For investors, writing or selling options can create an income stream from underlying [[Stocks|stocks]] they already own at the expense of limiting potential profits from the underlying itself.

For both traders and investors, options also provide a vehicle for [[hedging]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp). For example, a holder of a position of [[Stock|stock]] might also buy put options to protect against a significant downside move. The small amount of cost for the [[option contract]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) is, in essence, an insurance policy.

## Caveats for [[Listed]] Options

While the [[Risk|risk]] for options holders is limited to the amount they paid to purchase them, called the [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-[[Premium|premium]].asp), the risk for options sellers, or writers, can be infinite. This higher risk is because options sellers have the obligation, not the right, to sell or to buy, depending on the case, the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset at the [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp).

For example, the holder of a $50 call option on [[Stock|stock]] ABC [[Will|will]] [[exercise]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp) that option if the stock's price rises to $70. The writer of the option sells the stock at $50, and if they do not already own it, they must go into the [[open market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp) to buy the [[Shares|shares]] at $70. The net result will be a $20 loss, less the amount of [[Premium|premium]] collected initially for selling the option.

Sellers of puts take on a similar [[Risk|risk]], with the only small comfort being that the [[Stocks|stocks]] cannot fall below zero. Options buyers take the risk of time. Should the [[underlying]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]].asp) [[Stock|stock]]'s price not move, then the option's price [[Will|will]] naturally decay as the [[expiration date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp) nears. Fortunately, there are options strategies for both buyers and sellers using multiple options with similar or different strike prices and expirations to mitigate these risks.
