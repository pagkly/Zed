[[Underlying Security Definition]]
## What Is an [[Underlying]] [[Security]]?

An [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] is a [[Stock|stock]] or bond on which [[Derivative|derivative]] instruments, such as [[futures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Futures|futures]].asp), [[ETF]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)s, and [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), are based. It is the primary component of how the derivative gets its value.

For example, a [[call option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on Alphabet, Inc. (GOOG/GOOGL) [[Stock|stock]] gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase Alphabet stock at a price specified in the [[option contract]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp). In this case, Alphabet stock is the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]].

## How an [[Underlying]] [[Security]] Works

There are many widely used and exotic [[derivatives]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp), but they all have one item in common which is their basis on an [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] or [[underlying asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp). Price movements in the underlying security [[Will|will]] necessarily affect the pricing of the derivative based upon it.

In [[Derivative|derivative]] terminology, the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] is often referred to simply as "the underlying." An underlying security can be any asset, index, financial instrument, or even another derivative. The infamous [[collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) and [[credit default swaps (CDS)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), which were front and center in the [[Financial crisis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp) of 2008, are also derivatives that depend on the movement of an underlying.

Traders use derivatives to either [[speculate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Speculation|speculation]].asp) on or [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) against, the future price movements of the [[Underlying|underlying]]. The more complex a [[Derivative|derivative]] becomes, the more significant the degree of speculation and hedging become. For example, [[options on futures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/options-on-[[Futures|futures]].asp) are bets on the future price of the futures contract, which in itself is a bet on the future price of the underlying.

## The Role of the [[Underlying]]

The apparent role of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] is merely to be itself. If there were no derivatives, traders would simply buy and sell the underlying. However, when it comes to derivatives, the underlying is the item which must be delivered by one party in the [[Derivative|derivative]] contract and accepted by the other party. The exception is when the underlying is an index, or the derivative is a [[swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Swap|swap]].asp) where only cash is exchanged at the end of the derivative contract.

## Example of an [[Underlying]] [[Security]]

Let's say we are interested in buying a call option on MSFT. Buying a call gives us the right to buy [[Shares|shares]] of MSFT at a determined price and time. Generally speaking, the value of the call option [[Will|will]] increase alongside an increase in the share price of MSFT. Because the call option is a [[Derivative|derivative]], its price is tied to the price of MSFT. MSFT in this case is the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]].

The [[Underlying|underlying]] is also crucial to the pricing of derivatives. The relationship between the underlying and its derivatives is not linear, although it can be. Generally speaking for example, the more distant the [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) for an [[out-of-the-money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp) option is from the current price of the underlying, the less the option price changes per unit of movement in the underlying.

Also, the [[Derivative|derivative]] contract may be written so that its price may be directly correlated, or [[inversely correlated]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverse-[[Correlation|correlation]].asp), to the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]]. A call option is directly correlated. A [[put option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) is inversely correlated.
