[[Realization Multiple]]
## What Is the [[Realization Multiple]]?

The [[Realization Multiple|realization multiple]] is a [[private equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp) measurement that shows how much has been paid out to investors. The realization multiple measures the [[Return|return]] that is realized from the investment. Private [[Equity|equity]] funds are unique in that they [[Hold|hold]] assets that are pulled together from all sorts of illiquid sources, including [[leveraged buyouts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp) (LBO), start-ups and so on. The realization multiple is found by dividing the cumulative distributions from a fund, company or project by the paid-in capital.

The [[Realization Multiple|realization multiple]] is also referred to as distributed to paid-in capital (DPI).

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Realization Multiple|realization multiple]] is used in private [[Equity|equity]] to measure the actual money paid back to investors.
-   The [[Realization Multiple|realization multiple]] is effectively the realized [[Return|return]] to a private [[Equity Fund|equity fund]] and may also be known as distributed paid-in capital.
-   This multiple is a nominal rate of [[Return|return]], meaning that it does not account for inflation or the time value of money.

## How [[Realization Multiple]] Works

The [[Realization Multiple|realization multiple]] is popular among venture capitalists and private [[Equity Fund|equity fund]] investors. This is because it focuses on what has actually been paid out to investors. If a private [[Equity|equity]] fund is paying out money to investors year after year, its realization multiple [[Will|will]] climb as there are more distributions in the books. This allows a private equity investor to easily spot a fund that is successful at returning money back to its investors.

## [[Realization Multiple]] as Part of the Whole

The [[Realization Multiple|realization multiple]] does not tell the whole story of a private [[Equity Fund|equity fund]]’s performance. It is combined with other measures like the investment multiple, the [[paid-in capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paidincapital.asp) (PIC), the total value to paid in multiple (TVPI), and the [[Residual Value|residual value]] to paid in multiple (RVPI). Of course, the fund’s [[internal rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp) since inception is also used as a key measure. Investors are essentially searching for the funds that generate a large amount of [[Return|return]] (investment multiple) and aren’t shy about returning some of it to investors on a regular basis.

As with most private [[Equity|equity]] measures, the [[Realization Multiple|realization multiple]] ignores the [[time value of money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp). This differentiates the realization multiple from other valuation methods, such as internal rate of [[Return|return]] or net present value. Private equity funds are difficult to evaluate due to the types of investments they [[Hold|hold]]. There isn’t a deep market that can establish valuation on a daily basis, so investors have to make guesses and leaps of faith when it comes to putting a number on the [[Residual Value|residual value]]. The realization multiple strips some of the uncertainty away and zeros in on what investors have seen from this fund in actual returned funds and, by extension, what is reasonable to expect in the future. The caveat is that in the world of private equity investing, past events only influence future events to a limited extent. All it takes is for a financing shift, and LBOs or heavily leveraged startups have a steeper hill to climb before a future exit strategy through an [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO).
