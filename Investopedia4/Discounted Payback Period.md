[[Discounted Payback Period]]
## What Is the [[Discounted Payback Period]]?

The [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] is a [[capital budgeting]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/corporate-project-valuation-methods.asp) procedure used to determine the profitability of a project. A discounted payback period gives the number of years it takes to break even from undertaking the initial expenditure, by discounting future cash flows and recognizing the [[time value of money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp). The metric is used to evaluate the feasibility and profitability of a given project.

The more simplified [[payback period]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paybackperiod.asp) formula, which simply divides the total cash outlay for the project by the average annual [[cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp), doesn't provide as accurate of an answer to the question of whether or not to take on a project because it assumes only one, upfront investment, and does not factor in the time value of money.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] is used as part of capital budgeting to determine which projects to take on.
-   More accurate than the standard payback period calculation, the [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] factors in the time value of money.
-   The [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] formula shows how long it [[Will|will]] take to recoup an investment based on observing the present value of the project's projected cash flows.
-   The shorter a [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] is, means the sooner a project or investment [[Will|will]] generate cash flows to cover the initial cost.

#### [[Discounted Payback Period]]

## Understanding theÂ [[Discounted Payback Period]]

When deciding on any project to embark on, a company or investor wants to know when their investment [[Will|will]] pay off, meaning when the cash flows generated from the project will cover the cost of the project.

This is particularly useful because companies and investors usually have to choose between more than one project or investment, so being able to determine when certain projects [[Will|will]] pay back compared to others makes the decision easier.

The basic method of the [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] is taking the future estimated cash flows of a project and discounting them to the [[present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp). This is compared to the initial [[outlay]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outlaycost.asp) of capital for the investment.

The period of time that a project or investment takes for the present value of future cash flows to equal the initial cost provides an indication of when the project or investment [[Will|will]] break even. The point after that is when cash flows will be above the initial cost.

The shorter a [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] is means the sooner a project or investment [[Will|will]] generate cash flows to cover the initial cost. A general rule to consider when using the discounted payback period is to accept projects that have a [[payback period]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paybackperiod.asp) that is shorter than the target timeframe.

A company can compare its required break-even date for a project to the point at which the project [[Will|will]] break even according to the [[discounted cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) used in the [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] analysis, to approve or reject the project.

## Calculating the [[Discounted Payback Period]]

To begin, the periodic cash flows of a project must be estimated and shown by each period in a table or [[spreadsheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051315/how-do-you-calculate-payback-period-using-excel.asp). These cash flows are then reduced by their [[present value factor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pvif.asp) to reflect the discounting process. This can be done using the present value function and a table in a spreadsheet program.

Next, assuming the project starts with a large cash outflow, or investment to begin the project, the future discounted cash inflows are netted against the initial investment outflow. The [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] process is applied to each additional period's cash inflow to find the point at which the inflows equal the outflows. At this point, the project's initial cost has been paid off, with the payback period being reduced to zero.

## Payback Period vs. [[Discounted Payback Period]]

The payback period is the amount of time for a project to break even in cash collections using nominal dollars. Alternatively, the [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] reflects the amount of time necessary to break even in a project, based not only on what cash flows occur but when they occur and the prevailing [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) in the market.

These two calculations, although similar, may not [[Return|return]] the same result due to the discounting of cash flows. For example, projects with higher cash flows toward the end of a project's life [[Will|will]] experience greater discounting due to [[compound interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp). For this reason, the payback period may return a positive figure, while the [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] returns a negative figure.

## Example of the [[Discounted Payback Period]]

Assume that Company A has a project requiring an initial cash outlay of $3,000. The project is expected to [[Return|return]] $1,000 each period for the next five periods, and the appropriate [[discount rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp) is 4%. The [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] calculation begins with the -$3,000 cash outlay in the starting period. The first period [[Will|will]] experience a +$1,000 cash inflow.

Using the present value discount calculation, this figure is $1,000/1.04 = $961.54. Thus, after the first period, the project still requires $3,000 - $961.54 = $2,038.46 to break even. After the discounted cash flows of $1,000 / (1.04)2 = $924.56 in period two, and $1,000/(1.04)3 = $889.00 in period three, the net project balance is $3,000 - ($961.54 +$924.56 + $889.00) = $224.90.

Therefore, after receipt of the fourth payment, which is discounted to $854.80, the project [[Will|will]] have a positive balance of $629.90. Therefore, the [[Discounted Payback Period|discounted payback period]] is sometime during the fourth period.
