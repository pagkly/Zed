[[Long-Term Debt to Capitalization Ratio]]
## What Is the [[Long-Term Debt to Capitalization Ratio]]?

The [[Long-Term Debt to Capitalization Ratio|long-term debt to capitalization ratio]], a variation of the traditional [[debt-to-equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp) (D/E) ratio, shows the financial [[Leverage|leverage]] of a firm. It is calculated by dividing long-term [[Debt|debt]] by total available capital (long-term debt, [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], and [[Common Stock|common stock]]). Investors compare the financial leverage of firms to analyze the associated investment [[Risk|risk]]. High ratios indicate riskier investments, as debt is the primary source of financing and introduces a greater risk of insolvency.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Long-Term Debt to Capitalization Ratio|Long-term debt to capitalization ratio]] is a solvency measure that shows the degree of financial [[Leverage|leverage]] a firm takes on.
-   It calculates the proportion of long-erm [[Debt|debt]] a company uses to [[Finance|finance]] its assets, relative to the amount of [[Equity|equity]] used for the same purpose.
-   A higher ratio result means that a company is more highly leveraged, which carries a higher [[Risk|risk]] of insolvency.

## Understanding [[Long-Term Debt to Capitalization Ratio]]

To achieve a balanced capital structure, firms must analyze whether using [[Debt|debt]], [[Equity|equity]] ([[Stock|stock]]), or both is feasible and suitable for their business. Financial [[Leverage|leverage]] is a metric that shows how much a company uses debt to [[Finance|finance]] its operations. A company with a high level of leverage needs profits and revenue that are high enough to compensate for the additional debt they show on their balance sheet.

Long-term [[Debt|debt]] can be beneficial if a company anticipates strong growth and ample profits permitting on-time debt repayments. Lenders collect only their due interest and do not participate in profit sharing among [[Equity|equity]] holders, making [[Debt Financing|debt financing]] sometimes a preferred funding source. On the other hand, long-term debt can impose great financial strain on struggling companies and possibly lead to insolvency.

## Long-Term [[Debt]] and [[Cost of Capital]]

Contrary to intuitive understanding, using long-term [[Debt|debt]] can help lower a company's total [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp). Lenders establish terms that are not predicated on the borrower's financial performance; therefore, they are only entitled to what is due according to the agreement (e.g., [[Principal|principal]] and interest). When a company finances with [[Equity|equity]], it must share profits proportionately with equity holders, commonly referred to as shareholders. Financing with equity appears attractive and may be the best solution for many companies; however, it is quite an expensive endeavor.

## Financing [[Risk]]

When the amount of long-term [[Debt|debt]] relative to the sum of all capital has become a dominant funding source, it may increase financing [[Risk|risk]]. Long-term debt is often compared with [[Debt Service|debt service]] coverage to see how many times total debt payments have exceeded a company's operating income or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Uncertainty increases that future debts [[Will|will]] be covered when total debt payments frequently exceed operating income. A balanced capital structure takes advantage of low-cost [[Debt Financing|debt financing]].
