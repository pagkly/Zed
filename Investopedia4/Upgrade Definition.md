## What Is an Upgrade?

An upgrade refers to the positive change in an analyst's outlook of a particular [[Security|security]]'s valuation based primarily on that security's improving [[fundamentals]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Fundamentals|fundamentals]].asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   An upgrade refers to the positive change in an analyst's outlook of a particular [[Security|security]]'s valuation based primarily on that security's improving [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]].
-   An upgrade to a specific [[Security|security]] is usually triggered by qualitative and quantitative information that contributes to an increase in the financial valuation of that security.
-   The biggest benefit of an upgrade is that it lowers a company's [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]], for both [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]].

## Understanding an Upgrade

An upgrade to a specific [[Security|security]] assigns it a higher ranking and is usually triggered by [[qualitative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualitativeanalysis.asp) and quantitative information that contributes to an increase in the financial valuation of that security. In the context of [[Portfolio|portfolio]] management, the term "upgrade" also refers to a strategy whereby the [[Risk|risk]] profile and quality of the portfolio are improved by including blue chips in it while eliminating speculative [[Stocks|stocks]].

Upgrades to investment ratings for [[Stocks|stocks]] and [[fixed-income securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp) are issued by [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) and [[bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) analysts at their respective brokerage houses. Upgrades to the credit [[Rating|rating]] of corporate issuers of [[Debt|debt]] securities are issued by rating agencies, such as [[Standard & Poor's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp).

For example, a [[Rating|rating]] agency may upgrade the credit rating of an issuer from AA+ to AAA. Such a move would have a positive effect on all outstanding bonds and other fixed-income instruments of the issuer.

## Example of an [[Equity]] Upgrade

An example of an [[Equity|equity]] upgrade would be an analyst raising the investment [[Rating|rating]] for a particular [[Stock|stock]] (or sector) to "buy" from "[[Hold|hold]]." An upgrade of this nature would sometimes be accompanied by an upward revision in the analyst's target price for the stock.

For [[Equity|equity]] and [[Debt|debt]] securities, an upgrade generally leads to positive press. Behind the scenes, the biggest benefit to an upgrade is a lower [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]], for both debt and equity. A lower cost of capital translates into a lower [[Discount Rate|discount rate]], which leads to a higher valuation and firm valuation.

Similar to how an individual might be able to borrow at a cheaper interest rate after a [[Credit Score|credit score]] "upgrade," businesses can access the capital markets more often and at cheaper rates after a positive upgrade event.

Beyond an outright upgrade event, credit [[Rating|rating]] agencies and [[Equity|equity]] valuation shops both publish watchlist or similar lists indicating securities or companies prime for an upgrade (or downgrade). Investors and creditors alike keep a close eye on potential directional changes to a [[Security|security]] or businessÂ prospect.
