[[Reading Into Total Enterprise Value]]
## What Is Total Enterprise Value (TEV)?

Total [[enterprise value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp) (TEV) is a valuation measurement used to compare companies with varying levels of [[Debt|debt]]. Total enterprise value includes not only a company's [[Equity|equity]] value but also the market value of its debt while subtracting out cash and [[Cash Equivalents|cash equivalents]].

Some financial analysts use [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) analysis to derive the value of a company. [[Market Capitalization|Market capitalization]] is the value of a company by multiplying the current [[Stock|stock]] price by the total number of outstanding [[Shares|shares]]. However, companies often have different financial and [[capital structures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp), making TEV a better value measure when comparing companies.

### Key Takeaways

-   Total enterprise value (TEV) is a valuation measurement used to compare companies with varying levels of [[Debt|debt]].
-   TEV is calculated as follows: TEV = [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] + interest-bearing [[Debt|debt]] + [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] - cash
-   TEV helps with valuations of potential takeover targets and the amount that should be paid for the acquisition.
-   TEV is used to derive the overall [[Economic Value|economic value]] of a company.

#### Introduction To Enterprise Value

## Understanding Total Enterprise Value (TEV)

TEV is used to derive the overall [[Economic Value|economic value]] of a company and is often seen as a more comprehensive metric since it factors in a company's [[Debt|debt]] and cash, which can have a significant impact on a company's financial health and value.

TEV is calculated as follows:

-   **TEV** = [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] + market value of [[Debt|debt]] + [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] - cash and [[Cash Equivalents|cash equivalents]]

[[Market Capitalization|Market capitalization]] is added to the company's total amount of [[Debt|debt]]. [[Preferred Stock|Preferred stock]] is also added because it is a hybrid [[Security|security]], which has features of [[Equity|equity]] and debt. Preferred [[Shares|shares]] are treated as debt since the shares pay dividends and have a higher priority when it comes to claiming earnings versus [[Common Stock|common stock]]. Also, preferred shares are repaid similar to debt in the event of an acquisition.

[Cash and cash equivalents](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashandcashequivalents.asp) are subtracted from the formula because it reduces the cost of acquiring the company. [[Cash Equivalents|Cash equivalents]] may consist of [[Short-Term Investments|short-term investments]], [[commercial paper]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp), [[Money Market|money market]] funds, and [[marketable securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketablesecurities.asp) with a maturity date of 90 days or less.

Total enterprise value is helpful when companies engage in mergers and acquisitions. If an acquiring firm is interested in a company, it would need to know how much [[Debt|debt]] the target company has on its [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp). The acquiring firm might need to pay off the debt as part of the takeover. Also, if the acquiring firm also had debt on its balance sheet, it would be critical to know the amount of outstanding debt for the target company since it could impact whether or not the deal gets done. 

## Total Enterprise Value vs. [[Market Capitalization]]

Often, two companies that seem to have similar market capitalizations have very different total enterprise values.

For example, if a company was trying to compare its value to the value of a competitor, it would have to look beyond market capitalizations. Let's say that the competitor has a [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] of $100 million but has $50 million in [[Debt|debt]]. The company conducting the comparison might also have a market cap of $100 million but might instead have no debt and $10 million cash on hand. Based on TEV, the competitor's value would be $150 million while the company conducting the comparison would have a value of $90 million.

Let's say that instead of a comparison to a competitor, the company was looking to acquire the competitor. Using the [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] value, we would say that the takeover price for acquiring the company is worth $100 million. However, TEV shows that the cost of acquisition is really $150 million, due to the [[Debt|debt]] of $50 million in addition to the $100 million market cap.

It's important to remember that the acquiring company would be buying the target company's [[Debt|debt]] as well as its assets. As a result, TEV is a more accurate measure for valuing the price of a company during a merger or acquisition.

Total enterprise value can be used to compare two companies with different levels of [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] or to analyze a potential takeover target.

## Using the TEV to Normalize Values

The TEV, in addition to being a metric for comparing potential takeover candidates, also allows a company or financial analyst to normalize the valuation of a company. Many financial analysts use the [[price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) to derive a company's value, above and beyond its [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]]. The P/E ratio is a ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per share ([EPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp)). However, a company's P/E ratio does not always provide a complete picture since it only includes the market capitalization and profits (or earnings) of the company. P/E ratios can make a company appear expensive compared to another company when, in reality, it's not since one company might not have any [[Debt|debt]] while the other company has debt on its balance sheet.

Instead, financial analysts can normalize a company's valuation by taking the [[EBITDA]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp) (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization)-to-enterprise value. The EBITDA-to-enterprise value metric allows the [[Stock|stock]] price of [[public companies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp) to be better evaluated for investment purposes. The reason for this is that the calculation includes the components of the P/E ratio, such as profits and [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]], as well as all of the components in the TEV calculation such as total [[Debt|debt]].
