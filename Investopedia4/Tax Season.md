## Understanding [[Tax Season]]

[[Tax Season|Tax season]] is the period within which all income taxes must be filed up until the deadline. The deadline each year is typically April 15. However, if this date falls on a weekend or holiday, it is moved to the next business day. For instance, April 15, 2018 fell on a Sunday, and Monday, April 16 was a holiday—Emancipation Day. Therefore, taxpayers had until Tuesday, April 17, 2018, to file their 2017 tax returns and to pay any taxes due. Tax returns submitted after this date are subject to late penalty fees.

During [[Tax Season|tax season]], businesses must furnish employees, contract laborers, and others, such as [[royalty]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/royalty.asp) earners, with tax documents specifying data required to complete an individual's tax returns. People who are required to file a [[Tax Return|tax return]] must do so by April 15 or request an extension.

[[Tax Season|Tax season]] is a busy period for many tax preparers and accounting professionals. The three-and-a-half-month period at the beginning of the year is the time when the necessary paperwork, including wage and earnings statements (such as [1099s](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-1099-b.asp) or [[W-2s]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w2form.asp)), is collected to assemble [[tax returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxreturn.asp).
