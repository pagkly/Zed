[[What Is Participating Preferred Stock]]?
## [[What Is Participating Preferred Stock]]?

Participating [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] is a type of [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) that gives the holder the right to receive dividends equal to the customarily specified rate that [[preferred dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferreddividend.asp) are paid to preferred shareholders, as well as an additional [[dividend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) based on some predetermined condition. Participating preferred [[Stock|stock]] can also have liquidation preferences upon a liquidation event.

### Key Takeaways

-   Participating [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] is akin to preferred [[Shares|shares]] that pay both preferred dividends plus an additional dividend to their shareholders.
-   The additional dividend ensures that these shareholders receive an equivalent dividend as common shareholders.
-   Participating [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] is not common but can be issued in response to a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]] bid as part of a poison pill strategy.

## Participating [[Preferred Stock]]

Participating [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]]—like other forms of preferred [[Stock|stock]]—takes precedence in a firm's capital structure over [[Common Stock|common stock]] but ranks below [[Debt|debt]] in liquidation events. The additional dividend paid to [[preferred shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/preference-[[Shares|shares]]/) is commonly structured to be paid only if the amount of dividends that [[common shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common_shareholder.asp) receive exceeds a specified per-share amount.

Furthermore, in the event of [[liquidation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp), participating preferred shareholders can also have the right to receive the [[Stock|stock]]'s purchasing price back as well [[as a pro-rata share]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/prorata/) of any remaining proceeds that the common shareholders receive.

When there is a liquidation event, whether an investor's [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] is participating or nonparticipating [[Will|will]] determine if that investor receives additional consideration over the liquidation value of the preferred [[Stock|stock]] and any dividends owed to the investor. If an investor's preferred stock is participating, that investor is entitled to any value leftover post-liquidation as if that stock had been [[Common Stock|common stock]]. Nonparticipating preferred shareholders, on the other hand, receive their liquidation value and any dividends in arrears if applicable, but they are not entitled to any other consideration.

Participating [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] is rarely issued, but one way in which it is used is as a [[poison pill]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poisonpill.asp). In this case, current shareholders are issued [[Stock|stock]] that gives them the right to new common [[Shares|shares]] at a bargain price in the event of an unwanted takeover bid.

## Example of Participating [[Preferred Stock]]

Suppose Company A issues participating preferred [[Shares|shares]] with a dividend rate of $1 per share. The preferred shares also carry a clause on extra dividends for participating [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], which is triggered whenever the dividend for common shares exceeds that of the preferred shares. If during its current quarter, Company A announces that it [[Will|will]] release a dividend of $1.05 per share for its common shares, the participating preferred shareholders will receive a total dividend of $1.05 per share ($1.00 + 0.05) as well.

Now consider a liquidation event. Company A has $10 million of preferred participating [[Stock|stock]] outstanding, representing 20% of the company's capital structure with the other 80%, or $40 million, made up of [[Common Stock|common stock]]. Company A liquidates, and the proceeds are $60 million. The participating preferred shareholders would receive $10 million but also would be entitled to 20% of the remaining proceeds, $10 million in this case (20% x $60 million - $10 million). Nonparticipating preferred shareholders would not receive additional consideration.
