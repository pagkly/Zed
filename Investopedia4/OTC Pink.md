[[OTC Pink]]
## What Is [[OTC Pink]]?

The [[OTC Pink]], now branded as the Pink Open Market, is the lowest and most speculative tier of the three marketplaces for the trading of [[over-the-counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) [[Stocks|stocks]]. All three tiers are provided and operated by the [[OTC Markets Group]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc-markets-group-inc.asp). This marketplace offers to trade in a wide range of equities through any broker and includes companies in [[Default|default]] or financial distress.

Since it has no disclosure requirements, the categorization of [[OTC Pink]] companies is from information provided by the company. OTC Markets Group now markets OTC Pink as Pink Open Markets, but the historical name still persists.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[OTC Pink]], also known as the "pink sheets," is the most speculative of OTC Markets Group's platforms.
-   Companies on [[OTC Pink]] are not held to particular disclosure requirements or high financial standards seen with the [[Stocks|stocks]] [[Listed|listed]] on major exchanges.
-   Due to the wide variety of companies [[Listed|listed]] on [[OTC Pink]], including dark companies, delinquent companies, and worse, only sophisticated investors with a high [[Risk|risk]] tolerance should consider it.

## Understanding [[OTC Pink]]

The over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized market where securities, not [[Listed|listed]] on major exchanges, are traded directly by a network of [dealers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dealer.asp). Instead of providing an order matchmaking service like the [[NYSE]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp), these dealers carry inventories of securities to facilitate any buy or sell orders. Because information was initially printed on pink paper, the [[OTC Pink]] is also referred to as the [[Pink Sheets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp).

The [[OTC Pink]], as well as its companion tiers, [OTCQX](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcqx.asp) and [[OTCQB]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/[[OTCQB|otcqb]].asp), is run by OTC Link. The link is an electronic inter-dealer quotation and trading system developed by OTC Markets Group. Registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer, OTC Link is also an [[alternative trading system]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative-trading-system.asp) (ATS).

OTC Link allows broker-dealers not only to post and disseminate their quotes but also to negotiate trades through the system’s electronic messaging capability. This feature enabled it to replace the [[Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcbb.asp) (OTCBB), which was a quotation-only system.

## Regulation of the [[OTC Pink]] Marketplace

Because of the variable, self-reporting nature by [[OTC Pink]] companies, they are classified based on the quality and quantity of information they provide to investors. Classification is as follows.

-   **Current Information** companies are those that follow the [[International Reporting Standard]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ifrs.asp) or Alternative Reporting Standard. These companies make filings publicly available through the OTC Disclosure & News Service.
-   **Limited Information** companies include troubled firms in [[financial distress]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial_distress.asp), [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp), or those with accounting issues. This category also includes companies that are unwilling to meet the [[OTC Pink]] Basic Disclosure Guidelines.
-   **No Information** companies are those businesses that do not provide any disclosure at all.

All broker-dealers that trade on the OTCQX, [[OTCQB]], and [[OTC Pink]] securities have to be [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp) (FINRA) members. Further, they must register with the [[SEC]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) and are subject to state securities regulations. In this way, as with exchange-traded securities, investors trading OTC securities are protected from an unethical broker-dealer’s illegal practices by the same SEC and FINRA rules such as [[Best Execution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bestexecution.asp), Limit Order Protection, Firm Quotes, and Short Position Disclosure.

## Who Should Invest Through [[OTC Pink]]?

[[OTC Pink]] provides for transparent trading and best execution, although there are no financial standards or disclosure requirements. The marketplace trades a wide range of domestic and foreign companies including [[penny stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp), shell companies, distressed companies, and dark companies that cannot or [[Will|will]] not provide company information to investors.

Because of the lack of reporting requirements, only professional and sophisticated investors with a high [[Risk|risk]]-tolerance should trade here. Investors should perform all the proper [[due diligence]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) by researching the companies they are considering and reviewing all business activities.
