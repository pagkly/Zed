[[What Is Regulation DD]]?
## [[What Is Regulation DD]]?

Regulation DD is a directive set forth by the Federal Reserve. Regulation [[DD]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) was enacted to implement the [[Truth in Savings Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/truth-in-savings-act.asp) (TISA) that was passed in 1991. This act requires lenders to provide certain uniform information about fees and interest when opening an account for a customer.

It was enacted in order to help consumers make more meaningful comparisons and more informed decisions about the accounts they open at depository institutions, which provide the information noted above through [[disclosures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disclosure.asp). These disclosures are given to consumers are various times, including when an account is first opened.

## Understanding Regulation DD

Regulation DD applies only to accounts opened by individuals—not to corporate or other organizational accounts. It is designed to protect and empower non-sophisticated customers. Regulation DD helps individuals make intelligent decisions about where to open [[financial accounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-account.asp). The regulation applies to depository institutions with the exception of credit unions.

Regulation DD applies only to accounts opened by individuals, but not to corporate or other organizational accounts.

The types of accounts the regulation is intended to assist consumers with include savings accounts, checking accounts, [[Money Market|money market]] accounts, [[certificates of deposit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) (CDs), [[variable-rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variableinterestrate.asp) accounts, and accounts denominated in a foreign currency.

Financial institutions are required under Regulation DD to [[disclose information]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disclosurestatement.asp) to consumers regarding annual percentage [[Yield|yield]], interest rates, minimum balance requirements, account opening disclosures, and fee schedules. Disclosures are provided to consumers:

-   When the account is open.
-   When the consumer requests a disclosure.
-   When there are changes to the terms and conditions of the account.
-   When and if the account matures.

## Truth in Savings Act

Regulation DD implements the TISA, which was part of the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp) (FDIC) Improvement Act that passed the same year—in 1991. The act was meant to promote healthy competition between institutions and to create economic stability. It also directs banks to be more [[transparent]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transparency.asp) about some of their policies, giving consumers more power to decide where they want to do their banking business.

## Regulation DD Rules

Advertising rules set forth apply to individuals—including deposit [[brokers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp)—who advertise the types of accounts offered by the institutions subject to the regulation. The marketing rules restrict institutions from advertising in any way that may mislead consumers, present inaccurate information, or otherwise misrepresent the contract for the deposit account. The ads cannot use the term profit when referencing the interest paid on an account.

For example, if a deposit broker places an ad to [[Offer|offer]] consumers interest in an account, the advertising rules apply to the advertisement regardless of whether the account is held by the consumer or the broker.

## Regulation DD Amendments

Regulation DD was amended in 2006 to address issues like the concerns about uniformity of information provided to consumers when deposit accounts are overdrawn. In 2010, other amendments were added directing depository institutions comply with rule changes governing disclosures on periodic statements for aggregate [[overdraft]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overdraft.asp) and returned item fees. The amendments also featured a rule on providing balance disclosures to consumers made through automated systems.

Regulation DD stipulates that disclosures provided to consumers are clear and conspicuous, and are made available in writing or another form the consumer can keep. The disclosures must also make it clear and identifiable when these disclosures for different accounts have been combined. 

Disclosures must reflect the terms of the legal obligation established for the accounts in question and the agreement between the consumer and the institution. These disclosures can be rendered in electronic form at the approval of the consumer.
