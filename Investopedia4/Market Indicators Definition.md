[[Market Indicators Definition]]
## What are Market Indicators?

Market indicators are quantitative in nature and seek to interpret [[Stock|stock]] or financial index data in an attempt to forecast market moves. Market indicators are a subset of technical indicators and are typically comprised of formulas and ratios. They aid investors' investment/trading decisions.

### Key Takeaways

-   Market indicators are quantitative in nature and seek to interpret [[Stock|stock]] or financial index data in an attempt to forecast market moves.
-   Market indicators are a subset of technical indicators and are typically comprised of formulas and ratios.
-   Popular market indicators include [[Market Breadth]], [[Market Sentiment]], Advance-Decline, and Moving Averages.

## Understanding Market Indicators

Market indicators are similar to [[technical indicators]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp) in that both apply a statistical formula to a series of data points to draw a conclusion. The difference is that [[market indicators]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/10/indicators-that-move-the-market.asp) use data points from multiple [[securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) rather than just a single security. Often times, market indicators are plotted on a separate chart rather than appearing above or below an index price chart.

Most [[Stock|stock]] market indicators are created by analyzing the number of companies that have reached new highs relative to the number that created new lows, known as [[market breadth]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market_breadth.asp), since it shows where the overall [[trend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp) is headed.

The two most common types of market indicators are:

-   **[[Market Breadth]]** indicators compare the number of [[Stocks|stocks]] moving in the same direction as a larger trend. For example, the [[Advance-Decline Line]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advancedeclineline.asp) looks at the number of advancing stocks versus the number of declining stocks.
-   **[[Market Sentiment]]** indicators compare price and [[volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) to determine whether investors are bullish or bearish on the overall market. For example, the [[Put Call Ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putcallratio.asp) looks at the number of put options versus call options during a given period.

Here's an example of the [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] Advance-Decline Issues index:

## Popular Market Indicators

There are hundreds of different market indicators covering various indexes in the United States and around the world, including the [[NYSE]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp), [[NASDAQ]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/[[Nasdaq|nasdaq]].asp), [[AMEX]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amex.asp), [[TSX]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/toronto-[[Stock|stock]]-exchange-tsx.asp), TSX-V, and various options exchanges.

Some of the most popular market indicators include:

-   **Advance-Decline Issues** - The ratio of advancing to declining securities at any given point in time. Since the indexes are [[Weighted|weighted]] by [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp), this is helpful in determining true sentiment rather than just looking at the performance of the largest companies in a given index. Examples: $NYAD and $NAAD.
-   **New Highs-New Lows** - The ratio of new highs to new lows at any given point in time. When there are many new highs, it's a sign that the market may be getting [[frothy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/froth.asp), while many new lows suggest that a market may be [[bottoming]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottom.asp) out.
-   [**McClellan Oscillator**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mcclellanoscillator.asp) - This [[oscillator]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oscillator.asp) uses a moving average of highs and lows to help smooth out [[Market Breadth|market breadth]] and make it easier to interpret rather than looking at choppy charts showing the raw numbers. It ranges from +150 to -150.
-   [**Moving Averages**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) - Many market indicators look at the percentage of [[Stocks|stocks]] above or below key moving averages, such as the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Examples: $NYA50, $NYA200, $NAA50, and $NAA200.
