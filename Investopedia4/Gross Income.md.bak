[[Gross Income]]
## What Is [[Gross Income]]?

[[Gross Income|Gross income]] for an individual—also known as gross pay when it's on a paycheck—is the individual’s total pay from his or her employer before taxes or other deductions. This includes income from all sources and is not limited to income received in cash; it also includes property or services received. Gross annual income is the amount of money a person earns in one year before taxes and includes income from all sources.1 

For companies, [[Gross Income|gross income]] is interchangeable with gross margin or [[gross profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp). A company’s gross income, found on the income statement, is the revenue from all sources minus the firm’s [[cost of goods sold (COGS)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp). 

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Gross Income|Gross income]] for an individual consists of income from wages and salary plus other forms of income, including pensions, interest, dividends and rental income.2
-   [[Gross Income|Gross income]] for a business, also known as [[Gross Profit|gross profit]] or gross margin, includes the gross revenue of the firm less cost of goods sold, but it does not include all of the other costs involved in running the business.
-   Individual [[Gross Income|gross income]] is part of an income [[Tax Return|tax return]] and—after certain deductions and exemptions—becomes adjusted gross income and then [[Taxable Income|taxable income]].

## Understanding [[Gross Income]]

### Individual [[Gross Income]]

An individual’s [[Gross Income|gross income]] is used by lenders or landlords to determine whether said individual is a worthy borrower or renter. When filing federal and state income taxes, gross income is the starting point before subtracting deductions to determine the amount of tax owed.

For individuals, the [[Gross Income|gross income]] metric used on the income [[Tax Return|tax return]] includes not just wages or salary but also other forms of income, such as tips, capital gains, rental payments, dividends, alimony, pension, and interest. After subtracting above-the-line tax deductions, the result is [[adjusted gross income (AGI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp).3

Continuing down the tax form, below-the-line deductions are taken from AGI and result in a [[Taxable Income|taxable income]] figure. After applying any allowed deductions or exemptions, [[the resulting taxable income can be significantly less than an individual’s gross income]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070915/what-difference-between-taxable-income-and-gross-income.asp).4

There are income sources that are not included in [[Gross Income|gross income]] for tax purposes but may still be included when calculating gross income for a [[Lender|lender]] or [[Creditor|creditor]]. Common nontaxable income sources are certain [[Social Security]] benefits,5 life insurance payouts,6 some inheritances or gifts,7 and state or municipal bond interest.8 

### Business [[Gross Income]]

A company’s [[Gross Income|gross income]], or gross [[Profit Margin|profit margin]], is the most simple measure of the firm’s profitability. While the gross income metric includes the [[Direct Cost|direct cost]] of producing or providing goods and services, it does not include other costs related to selling activities, administration, taxes, and other costs related to running the overall business.

## Example of Individual [[Gross Income]]

Assume that an individual has a $75,000 annual salary, generates $1,000 a year in interest from a savings account, collects $500 per year in [[Stock|stock]] dividends, and receives $10,000 a year from rental property income. Their gross annual income is $86,500.

## Example of Business [[Gross Income]]

[[Gross Income|Gross income]] is a line item that is sometimes included in a company’s [[income statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp) but is not required. If not displayed, it’s calculated as gross revenue minus COGS.

Gross Income\=Gross Revenue−COGSwhere:COGS\=Cost of Goods Sold\\begin{aligned} &\\text{[[Gross Income]]} = \\text{Gross Revenue} - \\text{COGS} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{COGS} = \\text{Cost of Goods Sold} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

[[Gross Income|Gross income]] is sometimes referred to as [[gross margin]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossmargin.asp). Then there's [[gross profit margin, which is more correctly defined as a percentage]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-are-differences-between-gross-profit-and-gross-margin.asp), and is used as a profitability metric. The gross income for a company reveals how much money it has made on its products or services after subtracting the direct costs to make the product or provide the service.
