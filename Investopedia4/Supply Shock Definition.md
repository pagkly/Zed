[[Supply Shock Definition]]
## What Is a [[Supply]] Shock?

A [[Supply|supply]] shock is an unexpected event that suddenly changes the supply of a product or [[commodity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), resulting in an unforeseen change in price. Supply shocks can be negative, resulting in a decreased supply, or positive, yielding an increased supply; however, they're often negative. Assuming [[aggregate demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp) is [[Unchanged|unchanged]], a negative (or adverse) supply shock causes a product's price to spike upward, while a positive supply shock decreases the price.

## Understanding [[Supply]] Shock

A positive [[Supply|supply]] shock increases output causing prices to decrease due to a shift in the [[supply curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply-curve.asp) to the right, while a negative supply shock decreases production causing prices to rise. Supply shocks can be created by any unexpected event that constrains output or disrupts the [[supply chain]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp), including natural disasters and geopolitical developments such as acts of war or terrorism. A commodity that is widely perceived as the most vulnerable to negative supply shocks is [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] because most of the world's supply comes from the volatile Middle East region.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Supply|supply]] shock is an unexpected event that changes the supply of a product or commodity, resulting in a sudden change in price.
-   A positive [[Supply|supply]] shock increases output causing prices to decrease, while a negative supply shock decreases output causing prices to increase.
-   [[Supply]] shocks can be created by any unexpected event that constrains output or disrupts the supply chain, such as natural disasters or geopolitical events.
-   [[Crude Oil|Crude oil]] is a commodity that is considered vulnerable to negative [[Supply|supply]] shocks due to its volatile Middle East location.

## Example of [[Supply]] Shock

The struggles of a single firm can cause a [[Supply|supply]] shock if the company is a large producer of high demand products such as copper. According to _CNBC_, this was the case when Glencore announced in September 2015 its plans to [[close two major copper mines]](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/08/glencore-cuts-zinc-ouput-by-500000-tonnes-shutters-aussie-mines.html) in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, removing 400,000 tonnes of copper from the global output. The decision came in response to a prolonged slump in copper prices. Therefore, this particular supply shock was positive for competing firms.

According to _The Economist_, a slowdown in [[Chinese demand for copper]](https://www.economist.com/[[Finance|finance]]-and-[[Economics|economics]]/2015/10/01/red-scare) caused copper prices to drop. For the previous decade, demand had grown at an annual rate of more than 10% until it fell to 3% to 4% in 2015. This drop in price highlights how a concentrated change in demand can influence prices. A change in demand must be abrupt and perceived as temporary to qualify as a shock, as is the case on the [[Supply|supply]] side.
