[[What Is Credit Risk]]?
## [[What Is Credit Risk]]?

Credit [[Risk|risk]] is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a [[Loan|loan]] or meet contractual obligations. Traditionally, it refers to the risk that a [[Lender|lender]] may not receive the owed [[Principal|principal]] and interest, which results in an interruption of [[cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-is-cash-flow/) and increased costs for collection. [[Excess cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/excess-cash-flow.asp) may be written to provide additional cover for credit risk. When a lender faces heightened credit risk, it can be mitigated via a higher [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]], which provides for greater cash flows.

Although it's impossible to know exactly who [[Will|will]] [[Default|default]] on obligations, properly assessing and managing credit [[Risk|risk]] can lessen the severity of a loss. Interest payments from the borrower or issuer of a [[Debt|debt]] obligation are a [[Lender|lender]]'s or investor's reward for assuming credit risk.

### Key Takeaways

-   Credit [[Risk|risk]] is the possibility of losing a [[Lender|lender]] takes on due to the possibility of a borrower not paying back a [[Loan|loan]]. 
-   Consumer credit [[Risk|risk]] can be measured by the five Cs: credit history, capacity to repay, capital, the [[Loan|loan]]'s conditions, and associated [[Collateral|collateral]].
-   Consumers posing higher credit risks usually end up paying higher interest rates on loans.

## Understanding Credit [[Risk]]

When lenders [[Offer|offer]] mortgages, credit cards, or other types of loans, there is a [[Risk|risk]] that the borrower may not repay the [[Loan|loan]]. Similarly, if a company offers credit to a customer, there is a risk that the customer may not pay their invoices. Credit risk also describes the risk that a bond issuer may fail to make payment when requested or that an insurance company [[Will|will]] be unable to pay a claim.

Credit risks are calculated based on the borrower's overall ability to repay a [[Loan|loan]] according to its original terms. To assess credit [[Risk|risk]] on a consumer loan, lenders look at the [[five Cs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/five-c-credit.asp): credit history, capacity to repay, capital, the loan's conditions, and associated [[Collateral|collateral]].1

Some companies have established departments solely responsible for assessing the credit risks of their current and potential customers. Technology has afforded businesses the ability to quickly analyze data used to assess a customer's [[Risk|risk]] profile.

If an investor considers buying a bond, they [[Will|will]] often review the credit [[Rating|rating]] of the bond. If it has a low rating (< BBB), the issuer has a relatively high [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]]. Conversely, if it has a stronger rating (BBB, A, AA, or AAA), the risk of default is progressively diminished.

Bond credit-[[Rating|rating]] agencies, such as Moody's Investors Services and [[Fitch Ratings]], evaluate the credit risks of thousands of corporate bond issuers and municipalities on an ongoing basis.2 3 For example, a [[Risk|risk]]-averse investor may opt to buy an AAA-rated [[municipal bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp). In contrast, a risk-seeking investor may buy a bond with a lower rating in exchange for potentially higher returns.

## Credit [[Risk]] vs. Interest Rates

If there is a higher level of perceived credit [[Risk|risk]], investors and lenders usually demand a higher rate of interest for their capital.

Creditors may also choose to forgo the investment or [[Loan|loan]].

For example, because a mortgage applicant with a superior credit [[Rating|rating]] and steady income is likely to be perceived as a low credit [[Risk|risk]], they [[Will|will]] receive a low-interest rate on their mortgage. In contrast, if an applicant has a poor credit history, they may have to work with a subprime [[Lender|lender]]—a mortgage lender that offers loans with relatively high-interest rates to high-risk borrowers—to obtain financing. The best way for a high-risk borrower to acquire lower interest rates is to improve their [[Credit Score|credit score]]; those struggling to do so might want to consider working with one of the [[best credit repair companies]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-credit-repair-companies-4843898).

Similarly, bond issuers with less-than-perfect ratings [[Offer|offer]] higher interest rates than bond issuers with perfect credit ratings. The issuers with lower credit ratings use high returns to entice investors to assume the [[Risk|risk]] associated with their offerings.
