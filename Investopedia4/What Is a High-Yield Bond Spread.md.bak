[[What Is a High-Yield Bond Spread]]?
## [[What Is a High-Yield Bond Spread]]?

A high-[[Yield|yield]] bond spread is the percentage difference in current yields of various classes of high-yield bonds compared against investment-grade corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, or another benchmark bond measure. Spreads are often expressed as a difference in percentage points or [[basis points]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp). The high-yield bond spread is also referred to as credit spread.

### Key Takeaways

-   A high-[[Yield|yield]] bond spread, also known as a credit spread, is the difference in the yield on high-yield bonds and a benchmark bond measure, such as investment-grade or Treasury bonds. 
-   High-[[Yield|yield]] bonds [[Offer|offer]] higher yields due to [[Default Risk|default risk]]. The higher the [[Default|default]] [[Risk|risk]] the higher the interest paid on these bonds.
-   High-[[Yield|yield]] bond spreads are used to evaluate credit markets, where rising spreads can signal weakening macroeconomic conditions.

## How a High-[[Yield]] Bond Spread Works

A high-[[Yield|yield]] bond, also known as a junk bond, is a type of bond that offers a high rate of interest because of its high [[risk of default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp). A high-yield bond has a lower credit [[Rating|rating]] than government bonds or investment-grade corporate bonds, but the higher interest income or yield draws investors to it. The high-yield sector has a low [[Correlation|correlation]] to other fixed income sectors and has less [[sensitivity to interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest-rate-sensitivity.asp), making it a good investment asset for [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Diversification|diversification]].

The greater the [[Default Risk|default risk]] of a junk bond, the higher the interest rate [[Will|will]] be. One measure that investors use to assess the level of [[Risk|risk]] inherent in a high-[[Yield|yield]] bond is the high-yield bond spread. The high-yield bond spread is the difference between the yield for low-grade bonds and the yield for stable high-grade bonds or government bonds of similar maturity.

As the spread increases, the perceived [[Risk|risk]] of investing in a junk bond also increases, and hence, the potential for earning a higher [[Return|return]] on these bonds increases. The higher [[Yield|yield]] bond spread is, therefore, a [[risk premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp). Investors [[Will|will]] take on the higher risk prevalent in these bonds in return for a [[Premium|premium]] or higher earnings.

High-[[Yield|yield]] bonds are typically evaluated on the difference between their yield and the yield on the U.S. [[Treasury bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp). A company with weak financial health [[Will|will]] have a relatively high spread relative to the Treasury bond. This is in contrast to a financially sound company, which will have a low spread relative to the US Treasury bond. If Treasuries are yielding 2.5% and low-grade bonds are yielding 6.5%, the credit spread is 4%. Since spreads are expressed as basis points, the spread, in this case, is 400 basis points.

High-[[Yield|yield]] bond spreads that are wider than the historical average suggests greater credit and [[Default Risk|default risk]] for junk bonds.

## Benefits of High-[[Yield]] Bond Spreads 

High-[[Yield|yield]] spreads are used by investors and market analysts to evaluate the overall credit markets. The change in the perceived [[credit risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) of a company results in credit spread [[Risk|risk]]. For example, if lower oil prices in the economy negatively affect a wide range of companies, the high-yield spread or credit spread [[Will|will]] be expected to widen, with yields rising and prices falling.

If the general market’s [[risk tolerance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp) is low and investors navigate towards stable investments, the spread [[Will|will]] increase. Higher spreads indicate a higher [[Default Risk|default risk]] in junk bonds and can be a reflection of the overall corporate economy (and therefore credit quality) and/or a broader weakening of macroeconomic conditions.

The high-[[Yield|yield]] bond spread is most useful in a historical context, as investors want to know how wide the spread is today compared to the average spreads in the past. If the spread is too narrow today, many savvy investors [[Will|will]] avoid buying into junk bonds. High-yield investments are attractive vehicles for investors if the spread is wider than the historical average.
