[[Jensen's Measure]]
## What Is the [[Jensen's Measure]]?

The [[Jensen's Measure|Jensen's measure]], or Jensen's alpha, is a [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted performance measure that represents the average [[Return|return]] on a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] or investment, above or below that predicted by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), given the portfolio's or investment's beta and the average market return. This metric is also commonly referred to as simply alpha.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Jensen's Measure|Jensen's measure]] is the difference in how much a person returns vs. the overall market.
-   [[Jensen's Measure|Jensen's measure]] is commonly referred to as alpha. When a manager outperforms the market concurrent to [[Risk|risk]], they have "delivered alpha" to their clients.
-   The measure accounts for the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]] for the time period.

## Understanding [[Jensen's Measure]]

To accurately analyze the performance of an [[investment manager]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp), an investor must look not only at the overall [[Return|return]] of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] but also at the [[Risk|risk]] of that portfolio to see if the investment's return compensates for the risk it takes. For example, if two mutual funds both have a 12% return, a rational investor should prefer the less risky fund. [[Jensen's Measure|Jensen's measure]] is one of the ways to determine if a portfolio is earning the proper return for its level of risk.

If the value is positive, then the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is earning [[Excess Returns|excess returns]]. In other words, a positive value for Jensen's alpha means a [[fund manager]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundmanager.asp) has "beat the market" with their [[Stock|stock]]-picking skills.

## Real World Example of [[Jensen's Measure]]

Assuming the CAPM is correct, Jensen's alpha is calculated using the following four variables:

Using these variables, the formula for Jensen's alpha is:

Alpha = R(i) - (R(f) + B x (R(m) - R(f)))

**where:**

R(i) = the realized [[Return|return]] of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] or investment

R(m) = the realized [[Return|return]] of the appropriate [[Market Index|market index]]

R(f) = the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]] for the time period

B = the beta of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of investment with respect to the chosen [[Market Index|market index]]

For example, assume a mutual fund realized a [[Return|return]] of 15% last year. The appropriate [[Market Index|market index]] for this fund returned 12%. The beta of the fund versus that same index is 1.2, and the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate is 3%. The fund's alpha is calculated as:

Alpha = 15% - (3% + 1.2 x (12% - 3%)) = 15% - 13.8% = 1.2%.

Given a beta of 1.2, the mutual fund is expected to be riskier than the index, and thus earn more. A positive alpha in this example shows that the mutual fund manager earned more than enough [[Return|return]] to be compensated for the [[Risk|risk]] they took over the course of the year. If the mutual fund only returned 13%, the calculated alpha would be -0.8%. With a negative alpha, the mutual fund manager would not have earned enough return given the amount of risk they were taking.

## Special Consideration: EMH

Critics of [[Jensen's Measure|Jensen's measure]] generally believe in the [[Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)|efficient market hypothesis (EMH)]], invented by Eugene Fama, and argue that any [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]]'s [[Excess Returns|excess returns]] derive from luck or random chance rather than skill. Because the market has already priced in all available information, it is said to be "efficient" and accurately priced, the theory says, precluding any active manager from bringing anything new to the table. Further supporting the theory is the fact that many active managers fail to beat the market any more than those that invest their clients' money in passive [[index funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index-etf.asp).
