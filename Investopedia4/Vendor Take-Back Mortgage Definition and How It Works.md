Vendor Take-Back Mortgage: Definition and How It Works
## What Is a Vendor Take-Back Mortgage?

A vendor take-back mortgage is a unique kind of mortgage where the seller of the home extends a [[Loan|loan]] to the buyer to secure the sale of the property. Sometimes referred to as a seller take-back mortgage, this type of loan can benefit both the buyer and the seller. The buyer might be able to purchase property above his bank-determined financing limit, and the seller can get his property sold.

### Key Takeaways

-   A vendor take-back mortgage happens when the seller of the home extends a [[Loan|loan]] to the buyer for some portion of the sales price.
-   The seller retains [[Equity|equity]] in the home and continues to own a percentage equal to the amount of [[Loan|loan]] until the vendor take-back mortgage is paid in full.
-   Both types of mortgages can be subject to foreclosure in the event of the borrower's [[Default|default]] on the [[Loan|loan]] terms.

## Understanding Vendor Take-Back Mortgages

Most buyers already have a primary source of funding through a financial institution when they enter into this type of arrangement, so a vendor take-back mortgage is often a second [[lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp) on the property.

The seller retains [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) in the home and continues to own a percentage of its value equal to the amount of [[Loan|loan]]. This dual possession continues until the buyer pays off the original amount plus interest. The second [[Lien|lien]] serves to guarantee the repayment of the loan. The seller can seize the property that's the subject of the lien if the obligation isn't satisfied.

Sellers benefit from vendor take-back mortgages because they can generate extra income from the interest on the [[Loan|loan]].

## Vendor Take-Back Mortgage vs. Traditional Mortgage

A vendor take-back mortgage most often occurs in conjunction with a traditional mortgage, in which a homebuyer pledges her house to the bank as [[Collateral|collateral]] for the [[Loan|loan]]. The bank then has a claim on the house should the home buyer [[Default|default]] on the mortgage. In the case of a [[foreclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp), the bank can evict the home's occupants and sell the house, using the income from the sale to clear the mortgage [[Debt|debt]], as can the seller or second lienholder in the case of a vendor take-back mortgage.

The most common form of traditional mortgage is the [[fixed-rate mortgage]](https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/assistance/protection/mortgages.html), in which the borrower pays the same [[interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) for the life of the [[Loan|loan]]. Most fixed-rate mortgages have between a 10-year and 30-year term, during which the borrower's payment, including interest, won't change if market interest rates rise. The borrower might be able to secure a lower rate by refinancing the mortgage if market interest rates drop significantly after the time of purchase.

Several factors can [[affect your interest rate on a traditional mortgage]](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/7-factors-determine-your-mortgage-interest-rate/), from your credit history to how much of a down payment you put down to where your property is located. Likewise, several factors [[Will|will]] affect the interest rate you'll pay on a vendor take-back mortgage, including how much of a [[Loan|loan]] you're asking the seller to carry. The rate will often be higher when the seller's mortgage is the second [[Lien|lien]] on the property, compensating him for the [[Risk|risk]] he's taking.

## Example of a Vendor Take-Back Mortgage

Jane Doe is purchasing her first home for $400,000. She's required to make a [[down payment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down_payment.asp) to a [[Fixed-Rate Mortgage|fixed-rate mortgage]] [[Lender|lender]] of 20%, or $80,000, but she accepts a vendor take-back mortgage instead of paying this amount herself.

The seller lends Jane $40,000 toward the mortgage down payment and agrees to pay $40,000 himself. This single property now has two separate loans. One is the [[Fixed-Rate Mortgage|fixed-rate mortgage]] with the financial institution for $320,000. The second is the vendor take-back mortgage for $80,000.
