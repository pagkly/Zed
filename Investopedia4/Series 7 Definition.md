[[Series 7 Definition]]
The Series 7 exam licenses the holder to sell all types of securities products except commodities and [[Futures|futures]]. Known formally as the General Securities Representative Qualification Examination, the Series 7 exam and its licensing is administered by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp).1

Stockbrokers in the United States need to pass the Series 7 exam to obtain a license to trade. The [[Series 7 exam]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/022216/cfa-vs-series-7-which-easier.asp) focuses on investment [[Risk|risk]], [[Taxation|taxation]], [[Equity|equity]], and [[Debt|debt]] instruments; packaged securities, options, retirement plans, and interactions with clients for prospective securities industry professionals.2 This introductory-level exam assesses a candidate’s knowledge of basic securities industry information including concepts fundamental to working in the industry.1

The purpose of the Series 7 license is to set a level of competency for a registered representative or stockbroker to work in the securities industry. The Series 7 license is an essential requirement for an entry-level [[broker]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp).
