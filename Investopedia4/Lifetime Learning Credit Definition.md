[[Lifetime Learning Credit Definition]]
## What Is the Lifetime Learning Credit?

The lifetime learning credit (LLC) is a provision of the U.S. federal income tax code that lets parents and students lower their [[Tax Liability|tax liability]] by up to $2,000 to help offset higher education expenses.1

The amount of the credit is 20% of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses, or a maximum of $2,000 per [[Tax Return|tax return]]. The LLC is not refundable. So, you can use the credit to pay any taxes you owe, but you won’t receive any of the credit back as a refund.1

This credit may be claimed year after year, without a limit. However, it cannot be combined with the [[American Opportunity Tax Credit]](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/aotc) in the same tax year.2

### Key Takeaways

-   The Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) is for qualified tuition and education-related expenses paid for by eligible students enrolled in an eligible educational institution.
-   This credit can help pay for undergraduate, graduate and professional degree courses, including courses to acquire or improve job skills.
-   There is no limit on the number of years you can claim the credit. It is worth up to $2,000 per [[Tax Return|tax return]].

## How the Lifetime Learning Credit Works

The Lifetime Learning Credit may be claimed when a student is enrolled in undergraduate, graduate, or professional degree courses. The credit may also be used for courses in specific career-related skills.1

In order to be eligible for the LLC, a student must be enrolled at an institution that is considered eligible by the IRS. They must be taking higher education courses towards a degree or a recognized educational credential that provides or improves job skills.1

### What Makes an Eligible Educational Institution

An eligible educational institution is a school [[Offering|offering]] education beyond high school. It is any college, university, trade school, or other post-secondary educational institution eligible to participate in a student aid program run by the U.S. Department of Education.

Finally, they must be enrolled at a qualifying institution for at least one academic period that began within the tax year for which they’re claiming the credit. The IRS defines “academic period” as a semester, trimester, quarter, summer session, or other period determined by the school.3

The IRS also publishes an interactive mobile application–[Am I Eligible to Claim an Education Credit?](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/am-i-eligible-to-claim-an-education-credit)– that students can use to find out if they are eligible to claim an education credit.4

## Income Limitations for the LLC

In order to claim the full credit, a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]’s [[modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp) for the tax year 2019 must be between $58,000 and $68,000 if they file as an individual. For taxpayers filing jointly, income must be between $116,000 and $136,000.1

Taxpayers filing individually whose MAGI is below $66,000, but above $56,000, can receive a reduced amount of the credit. If filing jointly, taxpayers with MAGI of between $112,000 and $136,000 receive the reduced credit. Taxpayers with MAGI of over $68,000, or $136,000 for [[Joint|joint]] filers, cannot claim the credit at all.

## How to Claim the LLC

To be eligible to claim the AOTC or LLC, the law requires a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] or their dependent to get [Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1098t.pdf), from an eligible educational institution.2

This statement helps you determine what your credit [[Will|will]] be. The form will have an amount in Box 1 to show the amounts received during the year. But this amount may not be the amount you can claim. To research qualified education expenses, see the IRS factsheet [[Qualified Education Expenses]](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/qualified-ed-expenses) for more information on what amount to claim.5

Check the Form 1098-T to make sure it is correct. If it isn't correct or you do not receive the form, contact your school.

To claim the LLC, you must complete the [Form 8863](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8863.pdf). Attach the completed form to your Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR.3

## Other Tax Credits Related to Education Expenses

The U.S. government subsidizes individuals' higher education expenses through a number of tax credits, tax deductions, and tax-advantaged savings plans. Each of these programs lowers income [[Tax Liability|tax liability]] for students or their parents. The subsidies include the Lifetime Learning Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit, the tuition and fees deduction, and [529 savings plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529-savings-plan.asp).6

The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is a credit that is specifically for education expenses during the first four years of a student’s higher education. The AOTC offers a maximum annual credit of $2,500 per eligible student. If the credit brings the amount of tax you owe to zero, you can have 40 percent of any remaining amount of the credit (up to $1,000) refunded to you.2

The tuition and fees deduction simply allows taxpayers to deduct up to $4,000 from their [[Taxable Income|taxable income]] in eligible higher education expenses when filing their taxes. 529 savings plans help people to save money for future tuition through a tax-advantaged savings plan.6 3
