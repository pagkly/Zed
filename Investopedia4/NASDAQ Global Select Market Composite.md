[[NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite]]
## What Is the [[NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite]]?

The [[NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite]] is a [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] [[index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp) made up of U.S.-based and international [[Stocks|stocks]] that represent the [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] Global Select Market. As of August 2020, the NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite consisted of more than 1,400 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and [[Liquidity|liquidity]] requirements and corporate governance standards.1

The Global Market Select Composite is more exclusive than the [[Global Market Composite]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nqgm.asp). Every October, the [[Nasdaq]] Listing Qualifications Department reviews the Global Market Composite to determine if any of its [[Stocks|stocks]] have become eligible for listing on the Global Select Market.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite]] is a [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] index consisting of about 1,400 [[Stocks|stocks]] that represent the [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] Global Select Market.1
-   The [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] is composed of three distinct tiers: The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the NASDAQ Global Market, and the NASDAQ Capital Market.
-   The Global Select Market differs from the Global Market in that it is more exclusive and must meet more stringent financial and [[Liquidity|liquidity]] requirements.
-   Companies in the Capital Market tier meet less stringent requirements and have lower levels of [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] compared to the other two tiers.2

## Understanding the [[NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite]]

This [[Stock|stock]] index was created in July 2006 when the [[Nasdaq]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/[[Nasdaq|nasdaq]].asp) National Market split into two tiers, the NASDAQ Global Market and the NASDAQ Global Select Market.3 The change was nominal, as it did not affect listing standards, but rather was meant to reflect the global [[Scope|scope]] of the index and the companies [[Listed|listed]] on it. The select index encompasses about a third of the largest companies listed on the NASDAQ.

### [[Market Capitalization]]

The companies that comprise each tier of the [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] are placed according to their [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp). The NASDAQ Global Select Market tier is the most selective tier. To qualify for this "[large-cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp)" category, a company must meet the strictest financial requirements. A company's [[Stock|stock]] is reviewed annually to ensure it continues to be [[Listed|listed]] under the proper tier.2

If a [[Stock|stock]] meets or exceeds its current market cap requirements, under its current tier, it could be promoted to the larger [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] tier. If, however, a company's stock does not measure up to the market cap requirements of its current tier, it can be demoted to a smaller market capitalization tier.

## [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] Global Select Market vs. Other NASDAQ Tiers

The [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] had three distinct tiers: The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the NASDAQ Global Market, and the [[NASDAQ Capital Market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq-smallcap-market.asp). Potential NASDAQ companies must satisfy a variety of financial, [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp), and corporate governance requirements to be approved for listing on any market tier.2

Requirements for inclusion in the [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] Global Select Market are the most stringent of the three. Requirements for the NASDAQ Global Market are more stringent than those for the NASDAQ Capital Market. It's important to note that [[corporate governance requirements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporategovernance.asp) are the same across all NASDAQ market tiers.2

Even though a company’s securities qualify for initial inclusion, [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] may deny initial listing, or apply additional conditions, if necessary to protect investors and the public interest.2

## Requirements for [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] Global Select Market

A company interested in pursuing a [[stock market listing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp) on the [[Nasdaq]] must complete and submit an application. In general, it [[Will|will]] take Nasdaq four to six weeks to process a new listing application. The Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff is responsible for conducting a preliminary review of the application and issuing the company a comment letter. The company will have a specified time period to resolve or address any issues raised in the comment letter. If all issues are resolved satisfactorily, Nasdaq will complete their review and the company will be approved for listing.2

As mentioned, the listing requirements for [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] Global Select are more stringent than the other tiers. To meet the financial requirements, a company [[Will|will]] need to meet all the criteria of at least one of these four standards established by Nasdaq:

-   Standard 1: Earnings
-   Standard 2: [[Capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization.asp) with [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]
-   Standard 3: Capitalization with revenue
-   Standard 4: Assets with equity2

Additionally, the company must meet [[Liquidity|liquidity]] requirements that vary depending on whether the company is an [[initial public offering (IPO)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp), a [[spinoff]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spinoff.asp), or already currently trading [[Common Stock|common stock]].2
