[[Perpetual Bond]]
## What Is a [[Perpetual Bond]]?

A [[Perpetual Bond|perpetual bond]], also known as a "consol bond" or "prep," is a fixed income [[Security|security]] with no [[maturity date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp). This type of bond is often considered a type of [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp), rather than [[Debt|debt]]. One major drawback to these types of bonds is that they are not redeemable. However, the major benefit of them is that they pay a steady stream of interest payments forever.

### Key Takeaways

-   Perpetual bonds, also known as perps or consol bonds, are bonds with no maturity date.
-   Although perpetual bonds are not redeemable, they pay a steady stream of interest in forever.
-   Because of the nature of these bonds, they are often viewed as a type of [[Equity|equity]] and not a [[Debt|debt]].

## Understanding Perpetual Bonds

Perpetual bonds exist within a small niche of the [[bond market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp). This is mainly due to the fact that there are very few entities that are safe enough for investors to invest in a bond where the [[Principal|principal]] [[Will|will]] never be repaid.

Some of the notable perpetual bonds in existence are those that were issued by the British Treasury for World War I and the South Sea Bubble of 1720. Some in the U.S. believe the federal government should issue perpetual bonds, which may help it avoid the refinancing costs associated with bond issues that have maturity dates.

## Example of a [[Perpetual Bond]]

Since [[Perpetual Bond|perpetual bond]] payments are similar to [[Stock|stock]] dividend payments, as they both [[Offer|offer]] some sort of [[Return|return]] for an indefinite period of time, it is logical that they would be priced the same way.

The [[price of a perpetual bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082313/perpetual-bonds-overview.asp) is, therefore, the fixed interest payment, or coupon amount, divided by some constant [[Discount Rate|discount rate]], which represents the speed at which money loses value over time (partly due to inflation). The [[discount rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp) denominator reduces the real value of the nominally fixed [[coupon amounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/coupon/) over time, eventually making this value equal zero. As such, perpetual bonds, even though they pay interest forever, can be assigned a finite value, which in turn represents their price.

## Formula for the Present Value of a [[Perpetual Bond]]

Present value = D / r

Where:

D = periodic coupon payment of the bond

r = [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] applied to the bond

For example, if a [[Perpetual Bond|perpetual bond]] pays $10,000 per year in [[Perpetuity|perpetuity]] and the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] is assumed to be 4%, the present value would be:

Present value = $10,000 / 0.04 = $250,000

Note that the present value of a [[Perpetual Bond|perpetual bond]] is highly sensitive to the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] assumed since the payment is known as fact. For example, using the above example with 3%, 4%, 5% and 6% discount rates, the present values are:

Present value (3%) = $10,000 / 0.03 = $333,333

Present value (4%) = $10,000 / 0.04 = $250,000

Present value (5%) = $10,000 / 0.05 = $200,000

Present value (6%) = $10,000 / 0.06 = $166,667
