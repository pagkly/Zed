[[Market Neutral]]
## What Does [[Market Neutral]] Mean?

A market-[[Neutral|neutral]] strategy is a type of investment strategy undertaken by an investor or an [[investment manager]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp) that seeks to profit from both increasing and decreasing prices in one or more markets, while attempting to completely avoid some specific form of market [[Risk|risk]]. Market-neutral strategies are often attained by taking matching long and short positions in different [[stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp) to increase the [[Return|return]] from making good stock selections and decreasing the return from broad market movements.

## [[Market Neutral]] Explained

There is no single accepted method of employing a market-[[Neutral|neutral]] strategy. Beyond the method mentioned above, market-neutral strategists may also use other tools such as [[merger arbitrage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergerarbitrage.asp), shorting sectors, and so on. Managers who [[Hold|hold]] a market-neutral position are able to exploit any [[Momentum|momentum]] in the market. [[Hedge funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) commonly take a market-neutral position because they are focused on absolute as opposed to [[relative returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relativereturn.asp). A market-neutral position may involve taking a 50% long, 50% [[short position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) in a particular industry, such as oil and gas, or taking the same position in the broader market.

Often, market-[[Neutral|neutral]] strategies are likened to long/short [[Equity|equity]] funds, though they are distinctly different. Long/short funds simply aim to vary their long and short [[Stock|stock]] exposures across industries, taking advantage of undervalued and overvalued opportunities. Market-neutral strategies, on the other hand, focus on making concentrated bets based on pricing discrepancies with the main goal of achieving a zero beta versus its appropriate [[Market Index|market index]] to [[Hedge|hedge]] out systematic [[Risk|risk]]. While market-neutral funds use long and short positions, this fund category's goal is distinctly different than plain long/short funds.

## The Two Main Market-[[Neutral]] Strategies

There are two main market-[[Neutral|neutral]] strategies that fund managers employ: fundamental arbitrage and statistical arbitrage. Fundamental market-neutral investors use [[fundamental analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp), rather than quantitative algorithms, to project a company's path forward and make trades based on predicted [[Stock|stock]] price convergences. Statistical arbitrage market-neutral funds use [[algorithms]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithm.asp) and quantitative methods to uncover price discrepancies in [[Stocks|stocks]] based on historical data. Then, based on these quantitative results, the managers [[Will|will]] place trades on stocks that are likely to revert to their price means.

A great benefit and advantage of market-[[Neutral|neutral]] funds is their big emphasis on constructing portfolios to mitigate market [[Risk|risk]]. In times of high market [[Volatility|volatility]], historical results have shown that [[Market Neutral|market neutral]] funds are likely to [[Outperform|outperform]] funds using other certain strategies. Except for pure short-selling strategies, market-neutral strategies historically have the lowest positive correlations to the market specifically because the place specific bets on [[Stock|stock]] price convergences while hedging away general market risk.

## Example of a [[Market Neutral]] Fund

Because it is a market-[[Neutral|neutral]] strategy, the Vanguard [[Market Neutral]] Investor [[Shares]] fund uses long and short-selling strategies, unlike the firm'sÂ other mutual funds, which only buy and sell long positions. The fund's strategy aims to minimize the impact of the [[Stock|stock]] market on its returns, meaning the fund's returns may vary widely from those of the market.

Although most funds that short [[Stocks|stocks]], such as [[Hedge|hedge]] funds, do not disclose their short [[Holdings|holdings]] because SEC rules do not require them to, the Vanguard [[Market Neutral]] Investor [[Shares]] does publish its shorts. It chooses short positions by evaluating companies by five categories: growth, quality, management decisions, sentiment, and valuation. Then, it creates a composite expected [[Return|return]] for all of the stocks in its universe and shorts those with the lowest scores.
