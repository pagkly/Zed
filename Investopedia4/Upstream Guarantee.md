[[Upstream Guarantee]]
## What Is an [[Upstream Guarantee]]?

An [[Upstream Guarantee|upstream guarantee]], also known as a subsidiary guarantee, is a [[financial guarantee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-guarantee.asp) in which the subsidiary guarantees its parent company's [[Debt|debt]].

An [[Upstream Guarantee|upstream guarantee]] can be contrasted with a [[downstream guarantee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downstream_guarantee.asp), which is a pledge placed on a [[Loan|loan]] on behalf of the borrowing party by the borrowing party's parent company or stockholder.

### Key Takeaways

-   An [[Upstream Guarantee|upstream guarantee]] is when a parent company's [[Debt|debt]] or obligation is backed by one or more of its subsidiaries.
-   Such a guarantee may be required by a [[Lender|lender]] when the parent company's primary asset base is its ownership in the subsidiary itself.
-   [[Upstream]] guarantees are also utilized in leveraged buyouts when the parent company owns insufficient assets to back the buyout syndicate's [[Debt|debt]]-financed purchase.

## How [[Upstream]] Guarantees Work

[[Upstream]] guarantees enable a parent company to obtain [[Debt Financing|debt financing]] on better financing terms, by expanding the available [[Collateral|collateral]]. They often occur in [[leveraged buy-outs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp), when the parent company does not have enough assets to pledge as collateral.

A payment guaranty obligates the [[guarantor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guarantor.asp) to pay the [[Debt|debt]] should the borrower [[Default|default]], regardless of whether the [[Lender|lender]] makes a demand on the borrower. Alternatively, a collection guaranty only obligates the guarantor if the lender cannot collect the amount owed after bringing a lawsuit and exhausting its remedies against the borrower. Guaranties can be absolute, limited or conditional.

Typically, a [[Lender|lender]] [[Will|will]] insist on an [[Upstream|upstream]] guaranty when it lends to a parent whose only asset is [[Stock|stock]] ownership of a subsidiary. In this case, the subsidiary owns substantially all the assets upon which the lender bases its credit decision.

The problem with [[Upstream|upstream]] guarantees is that lenders are exposed to the [[Risk|risk]] of being sued for [fraudulent conveyance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fraudulentconveyance.asp) when the guarantor is insolvent or without adequate capital at the time it executed the guarantee. If the issue of fraudulent conveyance is successfully proved in a bankruptcy court, the [[Lender|lender]] would become an [unsecured creditor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredcreditor.asp), clearly a bad outcome for the lender.

Since the subsidiary guaranteeing the [[Debt|debt]] payments owns no [[Stock|stock]] in the parent company borrowing the funds, the former does not directly receive any benefits from the [[Loan|loan]] proceeds and, hence, does not receive a reasonably equivalent value for the guarantee provided.

## [[Upstream]] vs. Downstream Guarantees

An [[Upstream Guarantee|upstream guarantee]], like a downstream guarantee in which the parent company guarantees the subsidiary company’s [[Debt|debt]], does not have to be recorded as a [[Liability|liability]] on the balance sheet. However, it is disclosed as a [[contingent liability]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contingentliability.asp), including any provisions that might enable the guarantor to recover funds paid out in a guarantee.

A downstream guarantee can be undertaken in order to help a subsidiary company obtain [[Debt Financing|debt financing]] that it otherwise would be unable to obtain, or to obtain funds at [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) that would be lower than it could obtain without the guarantee from its parent company.

In many instances, a [[Lender|lender]] may be willing to provide ﬁnancing to a corporate borrower only if an afﬁliate agrees to guarantee the [[Loan|loan]]. This is because, once backed by the financial strength of the holding company, the subsidiary company's [risk of defaulting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp) on its [[Debt|debt]] is considerably less. The guarantee is similar to one individual cosigning for another on a loan.
