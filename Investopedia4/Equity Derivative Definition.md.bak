[[Equity Derivative Definition]]
## What is an [[Equity]] [[Derivative]]

An [[Equity|equity]] [[Derivative|derivative]] is a financial instrument whose value is based on equity movements of the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-asset.asp). For example, a [[stock option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp) is an equity derivative, because its value is based on the price movements of the underlying [[Stock|stock]]. Investors can use equity derivatives to [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) the [[Risk|risk]] associated with taking long or short positions in [[Stocks|stocks]], or they can use them to speculate on the price movements of the underlying asset. 

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Equity]] derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from price movements of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset.
-   Traders use [[Equity|equity]] derivatives to speculate and manage [[Risk|risk]].
-   [[Equity]] derivatives can take on two forms: equity options and equity index [[Futures|futures]].

## Basics of [[Equity]] [[Derivative]]

[[Equity]] derivatives can act like an insurance policy. The investor receives a potential [[Payout|payout]] by paying the cost of the [[Derivative|derivative]] contract, which is referred to as a [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp) in the options market. An investor that purchases a [[Stock|stock]], can protect against a loss in share value by purchasing a [[put option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp). On the other hand, an investor that has [[shorted]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) [[Shares|shares]] can [[Hedge|hedge]] against an upward move in the share price by purchasing a [[call option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp).

[[Equity]] derivatives can also be used for [[Speculation|speculation]] purposes. For example, a trader can buy equity options, instead of actual [[Stock|stock]], to generate profits from the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset's price movements. There are two benefits to such a strategy. First, traders can cut down on costs by purchasing options (which are cheaper) rather than the actual stock. Second, traders can also [[Hedge|hedge]] risks by placing [[put]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) and [[call]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) options on the stock's price.

Other [[Equity|equity]] derivatives include [[Stock|stock]] index [[Futures|futures]], equity index swaps, and convertible bonds.

## Using [[Equity]] Options

[[Equity]] options are derived from a single equity [[Security|security]]. Investors and traders can use equity options to take a long or short position in a [[Stock|stock]] without actually buying or shorting the stock. This is advantageous because taking a position with options allows the investor/trader more [[Leverage|leverage]] in that the amount of capital needed is much less than a similar outright long or short position on margin. Investors/traders can, therefore, profit more from a price movement in the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock. 

For example, buying 100 [[Shares|shares]] of a $10 [[Stock|stock]] costs $1,000. Buying a call option with a $10 [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) may only cost $0.50, or $50 since one option controls 100 shares ($0.50 x 100 shares). If the shares move up to $11 the option is worth at least $1, and the options trader doubles their money. The stock trader makes $100 (position is now worth $1,100), which is a 10% [[Gain|gain]] on the $1,000 they paid. Comparatively, the options trader makes a better percentage [[Return|return]].

If the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] moves in the wrong direction and the options are [[out of the money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp) at the time of their expiration, they become worthless and the trader loses the [[Premium|premium]] they paid for the option.

Another popular [[Equity|equity]] options technique is trading [[option spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spreadoption.asp). Traders take combinations of long and short option positions, with different strike prices and expiration dates, for the purpose of extracting profit from the option premiums with minimal [[Risk|risk]].

## [[Equity]] Index [[Futures]]

A [[Futures|futures]] contract is similar to an option in that its value is derived from an [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]], or in the case of an index futures contract, a group of securities that make up an [[index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp). For example, the S&P 500, the Dow index, and the [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] index all have futures contracts available that are priced based on the value of the indexes. However, the values of the indexes are derived from the aggregate values all the underlying [[Stocks|stocks]] in the index. Therefore, index futures ultimately derive their value from equities, hence their name "[[Equity|equity]] index futures". These futures contracts are liquid and versatile financial tools. They can be used for everything from intraday trading to hedging [[Risk|risk]] for large diversified portfolios.

While [[Futures|futures]] and options are both derivatives, they function in different ways. Options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the [[Underlying|underlying]] at the strike price. Futures are an obligation for both the buyer and seller. Therefore, the [[Risk|risk]] is not capped in futures like it is when buying an option.
