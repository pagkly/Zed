[[Equity-Linked Security (ELKS)]]
## What Is [[Equity-Linked Security (ELKS)]]?

The term [[Equity|equity]]-linked [[Security|security]] refers to a [[debt instrument]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtinstrument.asp) with variable payments linked to an [[Equity Market|equity market]] benchmark. These securities are an alternative type of fixed-income investment—structured products most often created as [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). Equity-linked securities are usually used in private market corporate capital financings, and are offered to investors to raise corporate capital. As such, they are not traded on financial market exchanges.

-   They are offered to investors so the issuer can raise capital.
-   These securities are an alternative type of fixed-income investment—structured products most often created as bonds.
-   ELKS normally mature within a one-year period and normally pay higher yields than that of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]].
-   Some kinds of ELKS include corporate, bank-offered, and market-linked.

## Understanding [[Equity-Linked Security (ELKS)]]

[[Equity]]-linked securities resemble both [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds. So although they may be [[Debt|debt]] securities, equity-linked securities provide returns that are tied to some form of [[underlying]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]].asp) equity—hence the name. This equity is normally a [[common stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp). This means the returns are linked to the upward and downward movements of the underlying [[Stock|stock]].

ELKS normally mature within a one-year period. The [[Yield|yield]] they pay is normally higher than that of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]]. They also make two payouts or distributions to investors before they mature, which is why investors prefer these kinds of investments.

[[Equity]]-linked securities normally mature within one year.

An [[Equity|equity]]-linked [[Security|security]] [[Offering|offering]] provides corporations with an alternative way to structure [[interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp) payments to investors. An issuer can base security interest payments on a range of [[Equity Market|equity market]] products including a [[Stock|stock]], a group of [[Stocks|stocks]], or an equity index. They may also cap or pay a specified portion of the benchmark’s [[Return|return]]. A standard equity-linked security structured as a bond would [[Offer|offer]] variable interest payments tied to an equity [[benchmark]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) and the return of [[Principal|principal]] at maturity. ELKS offer a controlled [[interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) product for the issuer.

## [[Equity]]-Linked [[Security]] Investments and Solutions

Investors may be offered the opportunity to invest in ELKS from a few different issuers. They may also find ELKS advertised as market-linked. The following are a few kinds of ELKS that are available on the [[market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp).

### Corporate ELKS

Corporations typically work with investment banks for support to structure [[Equity|equity]]-linked [[Security|security]] offerings for capital financing. The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) is a leading source of [[structured finance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/structuredfinance.asp) equity-linked securities. RBC works with companies to structure equity-linked security offerings with various types of provisions.

### Bank-Offered ELKS

Retail investors may see [[Equity|equity]]-linked [[Security|security]] offerings from a bank alongside certificates of deposit. An equity-linked security can be any type of investment with interest payments tied to an equity benchmark. Union Bank advertises [[equity-linked CDs]](https://www.unionbank.com/private-bank/[[Risk|risk]]-management/market-linked-cds/index.jsp) as one component of their [[market-linked CD]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexedcd.asp) [[Offering|offering]]. The interest on the CDs is linked to an equity index. The minimum investment is $4,000.

### Market-Linked Securities

Securities with payments linked to a market benchmark are offered across the investment industry. A market-linked [[Security|security]] can have payments linked to any type of market benchmark. An issuer could structure a market-linked security to make payments based on an [[Equity|equity]] benchmark. They can also use any other market benchmark such as gold or [[currency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp).

For the [[Security|security]] issuer, market-linked products [[Offer|offer]] the opportunity to control the payment to the investor by choosing a specified benchmark. For investors, they can offer an easy alternative to investing in the benchmark itself. An investor in a gold-linked CD would generally seek to earn the same rate of [[Return|return]] as gold. Issuers can structure market-linked products in numerous ways. [[Market-linked products]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092316/6-reasons-beware-marketlinked-cds.asp) are also known to be [[illiquid]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp) and not tradable or redeemable without penalty during the duration of the investment.
