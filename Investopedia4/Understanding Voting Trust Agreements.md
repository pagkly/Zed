[[Understanding Voting Trust Agreements]]
## What Is a Voting Trust Agreement?

A voting trust agreement is a contractual agreement in which shareholders with [[voting rights]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp) transfer their [[Shares|shares]] to a [[Trustee|trustee]], in [[Return|return]] for a [[Voting Trust Certificate|voting trust certificate]]. This gives the voting [[trustees]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustee.asp) temporary control of the corporation.

Details of a voting trust agreement, including the timeframe that it lasts and the specific rights, are laid out in a filing with the SEC.

## How a Voting Trust Agreement Works

Voting trust agreements are usually operated by the current directors of a company, as a countermeasure to [[hostile takeovers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hostiletakeover.asp). But they may also be used to represent a person or group trying to [[Gain|gain]] control of a company—such as the company's creditors, who may want to reorganize a failing business. Voting trusts are more common in smaller companies, as it is easier to administer them.

[Voting trusts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingtrust.asp) are similar to [[proxy voting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxy-vote.asp), in the sense that shareholders designate someone else to vote for them. But voting trusts operate differently from a proxy. While the proxy may be a temporary or one-time arrangement, often created for a specific vote, the voting trust is usually more permanent, intended to give a bloc of voters increased power as a group—or indeed, control of the company, which is not necessarily the case with proxy voting.

## Requirements for a Voting Trust Agreement

Voting trust agreements, which have to be filed with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC), specify how long the agreement lasts for—which is usually for a number of years, or until a certain event happens.

They also outline the rights of the shareholders, such as the ongoing receipt of dividends; procedures in the event of a merger, such as consolidation or dissolution of the company; and the duties and rights of trustees, such as what the votes [[Will|will]] be used for. In some voting trusts, the [[Trustee|trustee]] may also be granted additional powers, like the freedom to sell or redeem the [[Shares|shares]].

At the end of the trust period, the [[Shares|shares]] are usually returned to the shareholders, although in practice many voting trusts contain provisions for them to be revested on the voting trusts with identical terms.

### Key Takeaways

-   Voting trust agreements allow shareholders to transfer their voting rights to a [[Trustee|trustee]], effectively giving temporary control of the corporation to the trustee.
-   Usually found in smaller companies, these agreements are often used to prevent or facilitate takeovers.
-   Unlike proxy voting agreements, voting trust agreements tend to last for a longer duration of time—such as a number of years.
