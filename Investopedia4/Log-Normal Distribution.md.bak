[[Log-Normal Distribution]]
## DEFINITION of [[Log-Normal Distribution]]

A [[Log-Normal Distribution|log-normal distribution]] is a statistical distribution of logarithmic values from a related [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]. A log-normal distribution can be translated to a [[normal distribution]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102014/lognormal-and-normal-distribution.asp) and vice versa using associated logarithmic calculations.

## Understanding Normal and Lognormal

A normal distributions is a probability distribution of outcomes that is symmetrical or forms a bell curve. In a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] 68% of the results fall within one [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] and 95% fall within two standard deviations.

While most people are familiar with a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]], they may not be as familiar with [[Log-Normal Distribution|log-normal distribution]]. A normal distribution can be converted to a log-normal distribution using logarithmic mathematics. That is primarily the basis as log-normal distributions can only come from a normally distributed set of random variables.

There can be a few reasons for using log-normal distributions in conjunction with normal distributions. In general most log-normal distributions are the result of taking the natural log where the base is equal to e=2.718. However, the [[Log-Normal Distribution|log-normal distribution]] can be scaled using a different base which affects the shape of the lognormal distribution.

Overall the [[Log-Normal Distribution|log-normal distribution]] plots the log of random variables from a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] curve. In general, the log is known as the exponent to which a base number must be raised in order to produce the [[Random Variable|random variable]] (x) that is found along a normally distributed curve.

## Applications and Uses of [[Log-Normal Distribution]] in [[Finance]]

Normal distributions may present a few problems that log-normal distributions can solve. Mainly, normal distributions can allow for negative random variables while log-normal distributions include all positive variables.

One of the most common applications where log-normal distributions are used in [[Finance|finance]] is in the [[analysis of stock prices]](https://finance.zacks.com/[[Stock|stock]]-prices-considered-lognormal-10606.html). The potential returns of a stock can be graphed in a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]. The prices of the stock however can be graphed in a [[Log-Normal Distribution|log-normal distribution]]. The log-normal distribution curve can therefore be used to help better identify the compound [[Return|return]] that the stock can expect to achieve over a period of time.

Note that log-normal distributions are positively [skewed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/skewness.asp) with long right tails due to low mean values and high variances in the random variables.

**Lognormal Distribution in Excel**

Lognormal distribution can be done [[in Excel]](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/lognorm-dist-function-eb60d00b-48a9-4217-be2b-6074aee6b070). It is found in the statistical functions as LOGNORM.DIST.

Excel defines it as the following:

_LOGNORM.DIST (x,mean,standard\_dev,cumulative)_

_Returns the lognormal distribution of x, where ln(x) is normally distributed with parameters mean and standard\_dev._

To calculate LOGNORM.DIST in Excel you [[Will|will]] need the following:

x = value at which to evaluate the function

Mean = the mean of ln(x)

[[Standard Deviation]] = the standard deviation of ln(x) which must be positive
