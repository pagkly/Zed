[[Ultra-Short Bond Fund Creates Profit From Short-Term Investments]]
## What Is an Ultra-Short Bond Fund?

An ultra-short bond fund is a bond fund that invests only in fixed-income instruments with very short-term maturities. An ultra-short bond fund [[Will|will]] ideally invest in instruments with maturities around one year. This investing strategy tends to [[Offer|offer]] higher yields than [[Money Market|money market]] instruments, with fewer price fluctuations than a typical short-term fund.

## Advantages of Ultra-Short Bond Funds

Ultra-short bond funds give investors more significant protection against [[interest rate risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) than longer-term bond investments. Since these funds have very low durations, increases in the rate of interest [[Will|will]] affect their value less than a medium- or long-term bond fund.

While this strategy offers more protection against rising interest rates, they usually carry more [[Risk|risk]] than most [[Money Market|money market]] instruments. Further, certificates of deposits (CDs) follow regulated investment guidelines, but an ultra-short bond fund has no more regulation than a standard fixed-income fund.

### Key Takeaways

-   _Ultra-short funds have more freedom and typically pursue higher yields by investing in riskier securities._
-   _The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]] does not cover or guarantee ultra-short bond funds._
-   _In high-interest rate environments, ultra-short bond funds of certain types may be extra susceptible to losses._

## Ultra-Short Bond Funds vs. Other Low-[[Risk]] Investments

The main differences between ultra-short bond funds and other investments with relatively low risks–such as [[Money Market|money market]] funds and certificates of deposit–are not widely understood.

For example, [[Money Market|money market]] funds may only invest in high-quality, [[Short-Term Investments|short-term investments]] issued by the U.S. government, U.S. corporations, and state and local governments. Conversely, ultra-short funds have more freedom and typically pursue higher yields by investing in riskier securities. Also, the [[net asset values]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp) (NAV) of ultra-short bond funds fluctuate. By contrast, money market funds try to keep NAV stable at $1.00 per share. Money market funds are also subject to strict [[Diversification|diversification]] and maturity standards. However, these regulations do not apply to ultra-short bond funds.

Furthermore, the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp) (FDIC) does not cover or guarantee ultra-short bond funds. A certificate deposit, on the other hand, is insured up to $250,000. The FDIC covers CDs, which promises a [[Return|return]] of [[Principal|principal]] and a specified rate of interest because a bank or thrift institution holds the deposit. Also, CDs typically [[Offer|offer]] a better interest rate on deposited funds than a regular savings account.

Ultra-short bond funds that [[Hold|hold]] securities with more extended average maturity dates are also riskier than a fund with shorter average maturity dates, all other factors being equal.

## Credit Quality of Ultra-Short Bond Funds

It’s important for investors to research the types of securities an ultra-short fund invests into, because a credit downgrade or [[Default|default]] of [[Portfolio|portfolio]] securities may happen. [[Credit risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) is less of a factor for the ultra-short bond funds. The reduced [[Risk|risk]] is because they principally invest in government securities. However, investors should be aware of ultra-short bond funds that invest in bonds of companies with lower credit ratings, [[Derivative|derivative]] securities or private-label mortgage-backed securities. Those types of funds tend to be subject to higher levels of investment risk.

## Ultra-Short Bond Funds and High-Interest Rates

In high-interest rate environments, ultra-short bond funds of certain types may be extra susceptible to losses. It is important for prospective investors to research a fund’s “duration,” which gauges how sensitive the fund’s [[Portfolio|portfolio]] may be to fluctuations in interest rates.

Any investment which promises a more significant potential for [[Return|return]] at no additional [[Risk|risk]] should raise skepticism. Investors can learn more about an ultra-short bond fund by reading all of the fund’s available information, including its full prospectus.
