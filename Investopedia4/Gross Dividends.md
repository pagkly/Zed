[[Gross Dividends]]
## What Are [[Gross Dividends]]?

Similar in concept to [[Gross Income|gross income]], [[Gross Dividends|gross dividends]] are the sum total of all dividends received by an investor for tax purposes. Gross dividends include all [[ordinary dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinary-dividends.asp) that are paid, plus capital-gains distributions and [[nontaxable distributions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nontaxable-distribution.asp) received by the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] during the year before taxes, fees, and expenses are deducted.

[[Gross Dividends|Gross dividends]] can be contrasted with net dividends.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Gross Dividends|Gross dividends]] [[Will|will]] be adjusted for the presence of qualified dividends as well as any associated fees and expenses of receiving dividends.
-   Taxpayers use IRS form 1099-DIV to calculate their taxable exposure to dividend and related investment income.

## Understanding [[Gross Dividends]]

Most of the time, [[Gross Dividends|gross dividends]] paid to American investors are reported on IRS [[Form 1099-DIV]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form1099div.asp). [[Ordinary Dividends|Ordinary dividends]] are reported in Box 1a, while the other types of dividend income are [[Listed|listed]] elsewhere. All dividends are considered ordinary unless they are specifically classified as [qualified dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp). Box 1b is designated for reporting qualified dividends, which shows the portion of the amount in Box 1a that may be eligible for reduced capital gains rates. Box 3 shows non-dividend distributions.

A 1099-DIV is required to be sent to anyone who has received dividends (including capital [[Gain|gain]] dividends and exempt-interest dividends) and other distributions on [[Stock|stock]] of ten dollars or more, or if funds were withheld to pay foreign tax on dividends and other distributions on stock over a given year. Not all dividend income reported on the 1099-DIV is reported on Schedule B.

In many countries, income from dividends is treated at a more favorable tax rate than [[Ordinary Income|ordinary income]]. Investors may look to dividend-paying [[Stocks|stocks]] in order to take advantage of potentially more favorable tax conditions. The amount of tax owed on dividends depends on overall income and whether the dividends are qualified or nonqualified.

## Example of a Gross Dividend Versus a Net Dividend

As an example, let's say that company ABCXYZ decides to issue a dividend of $1.20 to its shareholders. This means for each share owned, the company pays $1.20 in dividends. If a shareholder-owned 1,000 [[Shares|shares]], they would receive an annual [[Payout|payout]] of $1,200 in [[Gross Dividends|gross dividends]]. Companies in the U.S. typically pay quarterly dividends, while non-U.S. companies generally pay annual or semi-annual dividends.

If the dividend was considered an ordinary one and taxed at a rate of 35%, with another 2% going toward fees and expenses, the net dividend would actually be $756. If the dividend was a qualified one instead, with a reduced tax rate of 15%, the net dividend would actually be $996.
