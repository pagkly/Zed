[[London Stock Exchange (LSE)]]
## What Is the [[London Stock Exchange (LSE)]]?

The [[London Stock Exchange (LSE)]] is the primary [[Stock|stock]] exchange in the United Kingdom and the largest in Europe. Originated more than 300 years ago, the regional exchanges were merged in 1973 to form the Stock Exchange of Great Britain and Ireland, later renamed the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The [[Financial Times Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ftse.asp) (FTSE) 100 Share Index, or "Footsie", is the dominant index, containing 100 of the top blue-chip [[Stocks|stocks]] on the LSE.

The [[Stock|stock]] exchange is physically located in the city of London. In 2007, the London Stock Exchange merged with the [[Milan Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/milanstockexchange.asp), the Borsa Italiana, to form the London Stock Exchange Group.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[London Stock Exchange (LSE)]] is one of the oldest [[Stock|stock]] exchanges in the world, the largest in Europe, and the primary stock exchange of the United Kingdom.
-   The [[London Stock Exchange (LSE)]] rivals the [[New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)]] in terms of [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]], trade volume, access to capital, and trade [[Liquidity|liquidity]].
-   The "Big Bang" refers to the government's [[Deregulation|deregulation]] of the London [[Stock|stock]] market on Oct. 27, 1986, an event that led to a modernized electronic trading system and opened up the LSE to capital markets worldwide.

## Understanding the [[London Stock Exchange (LSE)]]

London has long been one of [[the world's leading financial cities]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091114/worlds-top-financial-cities.asp), well-known as a hub for international trade, banking, and insurance. The history of the [[London Stock Exchange (LSE)]] goes back to 1698 when broker John Castaing began posting the prices of [[Stocks|stocks]] and commodities at Jonathan's Coffee House, which was a popular meeting place for businessmen to conduct trades. Castaing called his price list "The Course of the Exchange and Other Things."

By 1801 it became clear that a formal system was needed to deter fraud and unscrupulous traders. Brokers agreed to a set of rules and paid a membership fee to belong to the exchange, thus paving the way for the first regulated [[stock exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp) in London.

Through its primary markets, the [[London Stock Exchange (LSE)]] provides cost-efficient access to some of the world’s deepest and most liquid pools of capital. It is home to a wide range of companies and provides [electronic equities trading](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110713/basics-mechanics-behind-electronic-trading.asp) for [[Listed|listed]] companies.

The LSE is the most international of all [[Stock|stock]] exchanges with thousands of companies from more than 60 countries, and it is the premier source of [[Equity|equity]]-market [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp), benchmark prices, and market data in Europe. Linked by partnerships to international exchanges in Asia and Africa, the LSE intends to remove cost and regulatory barriers from [capital markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp) worldwide.

## The LSE and the Big Bang

On Oct. 27, 1986, the U.K. government deregulated the London [[Stock|stock]] market. Known as the "[Big Bang](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bigbang.asp)" because of the massive changes that immediately ensued, [[Deregulation|deregulation]] introduced electronic trading to the London Stock Exchange, which replaced traditional [[open outcry]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openoutcry.asp) trading. The new system was efficient and faster, allowing trading volumes to increase and enabling the LSE to successfully rival other global exchanges, such as the [[New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)]].

The Big Bang was part of the government's reform program to eliminate overregulation and encourage [[free-market competition]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp). It introduced other significant changes to the structure of the financial markets. These include the elimination of minimum fixed commissions on trades and the removal of the separation between companies that traded [[Stocks|stocks]] and those that advised investors.

These changes increased competition among brokerage companies and led to a series of [[mergers and acquisitions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp). Another Big Bang change allowed foreign ownership of U.K. brokers, which opened London's market to international banks.

## The Main Market

The Main Market of the London [[Stock]] Exchange is one of the world's most diverse stock markets with companies making up 40 different sectors. A listing on the LSE's Main Market gives companies access to real-time pricing; deep pools of capital; [benchmarking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) through the FTSE UK Index Series; and significant levels of media coverage, research, and announcements.

There are a number of different ways for companies to join the Main Market, including the following:

### [[Premium]]

The [[Premium]] segment applies only to [[Equity|equity]] [[Shares|shares]] issued by commercial trading companies. Premium listing issuers are required to meet the UK’s super-equivalent rules, which are higher than the minimum requirements of the [[European Union]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanunion.asp) (EU). Because of these higher standards, Premium-[[Listed|listed]] companies may have access to a lower [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] and to investors who seek out companies that adhere to the highest standards. A company with a Premium listing also has the possibility of being included in one of the [[FTSE indices]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/footsie.asp).

### Standard

The Standard segment is open to the issuing of [[Equity|equity]] [[Shares|shares]], [[Global Depositary Receipts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdr.asp) (GDRs), [[Debt|debt]] securities, and [derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) that must comply with EU minimum requirements. The overall compliance burden is lighter for companies with a Standard listing. A Standard listing helps companies from emerging markets attract investments from London's large pool of available capital.

### Other Segments

The High Growth Segment and the Specialist Fund Segment are designed specifically for high growth, revenue-generating businesses, and highly specialized investment entities that target [[institutional investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) or professionally advised investors, respectively. The High Growth Segment is for companies that are not eligible for a [[Premium]] or Standard listing but are seeking funding to grow their companies.
