#### Cash-Value Life Insurance

## How [[Cash Value Life Insurance]] Works

Cash value insurance is [[Permanent Life Insurance|permanent life insurance]] because it provides coverage for the policyholder’s life. Traditionally, [[Cash Value Life Insurance|cash value life insurance]] has higher premiums than [[term life insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) because of the cash value element. Most cash value life insurance policies require a fixed-level [[Premium|premium]] payment, of which a portion is allocated to the cost of insurance and the remaining deposited into a cash value account.2

The cash value of life insurance earns a modest rate of interest, with taxes deferred on the accumulated earnings. Thus, [[the cash value of life insurance will increase over time]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/082114/how-cash-value-builds-life-insurance-policy.asp). As the life insurance cash value increases, the insurance company’s [[Risk|risk]] decreases, because the accumulated cash value offsets part of the insurer’s [[Liability|liability]].

## Example of [[Cash Value Life Insurance]]

Consider a policy with a $25,000 death benefit. The policy has no outstanding loans or prior cash withdrawals and an accumulated cash value of $5,000. Upon the death of the policyholder, the insurance company pays the full death benefit of $25,000. Money collected into the cash value is now the property of the insurer. Because the cash value is $5,000, the real [[Liability|liability]] cost to the insurance company is $20,000 ($25,000 – $5,000).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of [[Cash Value Life Insurance]]

The cash value component [[serves as a living benefit for policyholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/082114/6-ways-capture-cash-value-life-insurance.asp) from which they may draw funds. The life insurance [[Net Cash|net cash]] value is what the policyholder or their beneficiary has left over once the insurance company deducts its fees or any expenses incurred during the ownership of the policy. There are several options for accessing funds. For most policies, partial [[surrenders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashsurrendervalue.asp) or withdrawals are permissible but these can reduce the death benefit.

Taxes are deferred on earnings until withdrawn from the policy and distributed. Once distributed, earnings are taxable at the policyholder’s standard tax rate. Some policies allow for unlimited withdrawals, while others restrict how many draws can be taken during a term or calendar year. Some policies limit the amounts available for removal (e.g., minimum $500).

Most [[Cash Value Life Insurance|cash value life insurance]] arrangements allow for loans from the cash value. Much as with any other [[Loan|loan]], the issuer [[Will|will]] charge interest on the outstanding [[Principal|principal]]. The outstanding loan amount will reduce the death benefit dollar for dollar in the event of the death of the policyholder before the full repayment of the loan. Some insurers require the repayment of loan interest, and, if unpaid, they may deduct the interest from the remaining cash value.4

Cash value may also be used to pay policy premiums. If there is a sufficient amount, a policyholder can stop paying premiums out of pocket and have the cash value account cover the payment.
