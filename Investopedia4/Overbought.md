[[Overbought]]
## What is [[Overbought]]?

[[Overbought]] is a term used when a [[Security|security]] is believed to be trading at a level above its intrinsic or [[Fair Value|fair value]]. Overbought generally describes recent or short-term movement in the price of the security, and reflects an expectation that the market [[Will|will]] correct the price in the near future. This belief is often the result of [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] of the security’s price history, but [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] may also be employed. A [[Stock|stock]] that is overbought may be a good candidate for sale.

The opposite of [[Overbought|overbought]] is [[oversold]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oversold.asp), where a [[Security|security]] is thought to be trading below its intrinsic value.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Overbought]] refers to a [[Security|security]] with a price that's higher than its intrinsic value.
-   Many investors use price-earnings (P/E) ratios to determine if a [[Stock|stock]] is [[Overbought|overbought]], while traders use technical indicators, like the [[Relative Strength Index (RSI)|relative strength index (RSI)]].
-   [[Fundamental Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] can also be used to compare an asset's market price to its predicted value based on financial statements or other [[Underlying|underlying]] factors.
-   Ultimately, [[Overbought|overbought]] is a subjective term. Since traders and analysts all use different tools, some may see an overbought asset while others see an asset that has further to rise.

## [[Overbought]] Explained

[[Overbought]] refers to a [[Security|security]] which has been subject to a persistent upward pressure and that [[technical analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) suggests is due for a [[Correction|correction]]. The bullish trend may be due to positive news regarding the [[Underlying|underlying]] company, industry or market in general. Buying pressure can feed on itself and lead to continued bullishness beyond what many traders consider reasonable. When this is the case, traders refer to the asset as overbought and many [[Will|will]] bet on a [[Reversal|reversal]] in price.

### Fundamentally [[Overbought]]

Traditionally, the standard indicator of a [[Stock|stock]]’s value has been the [[price-earnings ratio (P/E)]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/price-to-earnings-ratio/). Analysts and companies have used either publicly reported results or earnings estimates to identify the appropriate price for a particular stock. If a stock’s P/E rises above that of its sector or a relevant index, investors may see it as overvalued and pass on buying for the time being. This is a form of [[fundamental analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp), which uses macroeconomic and industry factors to determine a reasonable price for a stock.

### Technically [[Overbought]]

The rise of [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] has allowed traders to focus on [[indicators]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indicator.asp) of a [[Stock|stock]] to forecast price. These indicators measure the recent price, volume, and [[Momentum|momentum]]. Traders use technical tools to identify [[Stocks|stocks]] that have become overvalued in recent trading and refer to these equities as [[Overbought|overbought]].

Some traders use pricing channels like [Bollinger Bands](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp) to spot [[Overbought|overbought]] areas. On a chart, Bollinger Bands are positioned at a multiple of a [[Stock|stock]]'s [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) above and below an [exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp). When the price reaches the upper band, it may be overbought.

## How to Identify [[Overbought]] [[Stocks]] with RSI

[[Technical Analysis|Technical analysis]] has provided traders with increasingly sophisticated calculations to identify [[Overbought|overbought]] [[Stocks|stocks]]. George Lane’s [[stochastic]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp) oscillator, which he developed in the 1950s, examines recent price movements to identify imminent changes in a [[Stock|stock]]’s [[Momentum|momentum]] and pricing trend. This oscillator laid the foundation for the technical indicator which has become the primary indicator of an overbought stock, the [[relative strength index (RSI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp). The RSI measures the power behind price movements over a recent period, typically 14 days, using the following formula:

RSI\=100−100/(1+RS)\\text{RSI}=100-100/\\left(1+\\text{RS}\\right)

RS represents the ratio of average upward movement to downward movement over a specified period of time. A high RSI, generally above 70, signals traders that a [[Stock|stock]] may be [[Overbought|overbought]] and that the market should correct with downward pressure in the near term. Many traders use pricing channels like [[Bollinger Bands]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp) to confirm the signal that the RSI generates. On a chart, Bollinger Bands lie one [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] above and below the exponential moving average of a stock’s recent price. Analysts that identify a stock with a high RSI and a price that is edging toward the high end of its upper Bollinger Band [[Will|will]] likely consider it to be overbought.

## Example of [[Overbought]] Conditions Using RSI

Here's an example of a chart with a high RSI reading that suggests [[Overbought|overbought]] conditions:

In the above chart, the oversold RSI conditions (below 30) predicted a rebound in the [[Stock|stock]] price in October. The [[Overbought|overbought]] RSI conditions (above 70) in February could indicate that the stock [[Will|will]] consolidate or move lower in the near-term.
