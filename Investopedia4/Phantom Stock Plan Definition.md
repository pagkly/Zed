[[Phantom Stock Plan Definition]]
## What Is a Phantom [[Stock]] Plan?

A phantom [[Stock|stock]] plan is an employee benefit plan that gives selected employees (senior management) many of the benefits of [[stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) ownership without actually giving them any company stock. This type of plan is sometimes referred to as shadow stock.

Rather than getting physical [[Stock|stock]], the employee receives mock stock. Even though it's not real, the phantom stock follows the price movement of the company's actual stock, paying out any resulting profits.

### Key Takeaways

-   A phantom [[Stock|stock]] plan, or 'shadow stock' is a form of compensation offered to upper management that confers the benefits of owning company stock without the actual ownership or transfer of any [[Shares|shares]].
-   By simulating [[Stock|stock]] ownership, without actually providing it, management ensures that [[Equity|equity]] does not become diluted for other shareholders.
-   Large cash payments to employees, however, must be taxed as [[Ordinary Income|ordinary income]] rather than capital gains to the recipient and may disrupt the firm's [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] in some cases. 

## How Phantom [[Stock]] Plans Work

There are two main types of phantom [[Stock|stock]] plans. "Appreciation only" plans do not include the value of the actual [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Shares|shares]] themselves, and may only pay out the value of any increase in the company stock price over a certain period of time that begins on the date the plan is granted. "Full value" plans pay both the value of the underlying stock as well as any appreciation.

Both types of plans resemble traditional nonqualified plans in many respects, as they can be discriminatory in nature and are also typically subject to a substantial [[Risk|risk]] of [forfeiture](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forfeiture.asp) that ends when the benefit is actually paid to the employee, at which time the employee recognizes income for the amount paid and the employer can take a [deduction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deduction.asp).

Phantom [[Stock|stock]] may be hypothetical, however, it still can pay out [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) and it experiences price changes just like its real counterpart. After a period of time, the cash value of the phantom stock is distributed to the participating employees.

Phantom [[Stock|stock]], also known as [[Synthetic|synthetic]] [[Equity|equity]], has no inherent requirements or restrictions regarding its use, allowing the organization to use it however it chooses. Phantom stock can also be changed at the leadership's discretion.

Phantom [[Stock|stock]] qualifies as a [[Deferred Compensation|deferred compensation]] plan. A phantom stock program must meet the requirements set forth by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code 409(a).1 The plan must be properly vetted by an attorney, with all of the pertinent details specified in writing.

Phantom [[Stock|stock]] plans have a lot in common with traditional nonqualified stock plans.

## Using Phantom [[Stock]] as an Organizational Benefit

Some organizations may use phantom [[Stock|stock]] as an incentive to upper management. Phantom stock ties a financial [[Gain|gain]] directly to a company performance metric. It can also be used selectively as a reward or a bonus to employees who meet certain criteria. Phantom stock can be provided to every employee, either across the board or distributed variably depending on performance, seniority, or other factors.

Phantom [[Stock|stock]] also provides organizations with certain restrictions in place to provide incentives tied to stock value. This can apply to a [[limited liability corporation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp) (LLC), a sole proprietor or S-companies restricted by the 100-owner rule.

The two types of phantom [[Stock|stock]] plans are "appreciation only," which doesn't include the value of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Shares|shares]], just the increase in stock over the amount of time the shares are held; and "full value," which pays the underlying value and the amount the stock increased while it was held.

## [[Stock]] Appreciation Rights

[Stock appreciation rights](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sar.asp) (SARs) are similar to a phantom [[Stock|stock]]-based program. SARs are a form of bonus compensation given to employees that is equal to the appreciation of company stock over an established time period. Similar to [employee stock options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eso.asp) ([[Define Employee Stock Option (ESO)|ESO]]), SARs are beneficial to the employee when company stock prices rise; the difference with SARs is that employees do not have to pay the [exercise price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp), but receive the sum of the increase in stock or cash.

Most commonly made available to upper management, SARs can function as part of a retirement plan. It provides increased incentives as the value of the company increases. This can also help ensure employee retention, especially in times of internal [[Volatility|volatility]], such as an ownership change or a personal emergency.

It provides a level of reassurance to employees since phantom [[Stock|stock]] programs are generally backed in cash. This can, in turn, result in higher selling prices for a business if a prospective buyer perceives the upper management team as being stable.
