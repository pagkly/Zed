[[Convertible Preferred Stock Definition and Example]]
## What is a Convertible [[Preferred Stock]]?

Convertible preferred [[Stocks|stocks]] are [[preferred shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preference-[[Shares|shares]].asp) that include an option for the holder to convert the shares into a fixed number of [[common shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp) after a predetermined date. Most convertible [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] is exchanged at the request of the shareholder, but sometimes there is a provision that allows the company, or issuer, to force conversion. The value of a convertible preferred [[Stock|stock]] is ultimately based on the performance of the [[Common Stock|common stock]].

### Key Takeaways

-   Convertible preferred [[Shares|shares]] can be converted into [[Common Stock|common stock]] at a fixed conversion ratio.
-   Once the common share moves above the conversion price, it may be worthwhile for the preferred shareholders to covert and realize an immediate profit.
-   After a preferred shareholder converts their [[Shares|shares]], they give up their rights as a preferred shareholder (no fixed dividend or higher claim on assets) and become a common shareholder (ability to vote and participate in share price declines and rises).

## Understanding Convertible [[Preferred Stock]]

Convertible [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] is used by corporations for fundraising purposes. Companies can [[raise capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062915/what-are-some-limitations-and-drawbacks-using-payback-period-analysis.asp) in two ways: [[Debt|debt]] or [[Equity|equity]]. Debt must be paid back regardless of the firm's financial situation, but it generally costs less to obtain after [[tax incentives]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxcredit.asp).

[[Equity]] gives up ownership but does not need to be paid back. Both forms of capital fundraising have their advantages and disadvantages. Preferred [[Shares|shares]] are a type of hybrid [[Security|security]], falling somewhere between [[Debt|debt]] and equity.

[[Equity]] gives shareholders ownership, which gives them voting rights, but they have little claim on [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) if the company falters and liquidates. This is because [[Debt|debt]] holders and preferred stockholders are paid out prior to common shareholders from any assets remaining. [[Preferred Stock|Preferred stock]] is a hybrid [[Security|security]] that gives the shareholder a fixed dividend and a claim on assets if the company liquidates. In exchange, preferred shareholders don't have voting rights like common shareholder do.

Preferred and [[Common Stock|common stock]] [[Will|will]] trades at different prices due to their structural differences. Preferred [[Stocks|stocks]] aren't as volatile and resemble a [[fixed income security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp). There are many different types of preferred securities including cumulative preferred, [[callable preferred]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callablepreferredstock.asp), participating preferred, and convertibles. Convertible [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] provides investors with an option to participate in common [[Stock|stock]] price appreciation.

Preferred shareholders receive an almost guaranteed dividend. However, dividends for preferred shareholders do not grow at the same rate as they do for common shareholders. In bad times, preferred shareholders are covered, but in good times, they do not benefit from increased dividends or share price. This is the trade-off. Convertible [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] provides a solution to this problem. In exchange for a typically lower dividend (compared to non-convertible preferred [[Shares|shares]]), convertible preferred [[Stock|stock]] gives shareholders the ability to participate in share price appreciation.

Convertible [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] can be converted to common [[Shares|shares]] at the [[conversion ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conversionratio.asp). The conversion ratio is set by the company before the preferred [[Stock|stock]] is issued. For example, one preferred stock may be converted into two, three, four, and so on, common shares. If the common shares rise, the preferred shareholder may opt to convert their shares into [[Common Stock|common stock]], thus realizing an immediate profit. The price at which converting becomes profitable for the investor is called the [[conversion price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conversionprice.asp).

## Example of Convertible [[Preferred Stock]]

Convertible preferred [[Shares|shares]] priced at $100, with a conversion ratio of five, means that the [[Common Stock|common stock]] needs to trade above $20 in order for the conversion to be worthwhile for the investor. Even if the common [[Stock|stock]] is trading right near $20 it may not be worth it to convert since the preferred shareholder [[Will|will]] be giving up their fixed dividend and higher claim on company assets.

As the common [[Shares|shares]] rise, it becomes more enticing to convert. If the common shares move to $25, the preferred shareholder gets $125 ($25 x 5) for each $100 preferred share. That's a [[Gain|gain]] of 25% if the investor converts and sells the [[Common Stock|common stock]] at $25.

The danger in converting is that the investor becomes a common shareholder, at the mercy of the swings in the [[Stock|stock]] price. If the price collapses to $15 after conversion, and the investor didn't sell at $25, they are worse off than they were before. They own $75 ($15 x 5) in common [[Shares|shares]] for each [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] (worth $100) they owned, and they no longer receive their fixed dividend or claim on assets.
