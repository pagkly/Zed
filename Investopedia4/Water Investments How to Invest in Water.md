Water Investments: How to Invest in Water
We know water is the source of life. But it can also be a source for [[portfolio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) [[diversification]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp). Sounds strange, we know but remember: Like gold and oil, water is a [[commodity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp) – and it happens to be rather scarce nowadays. So, as with any other [[scarcity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scarcity.asp), the water shortage creates investment opportunities.

## Global Water Resources

About 70% of the earth's surface is covered in water, but 97% of it is saltwater, which is unfit for human use. Saltwater cannot be used for drinking, crop irrigation, or most industrial uses. Of the remaining 3% of the world's water resources, only about 1% is readily available for human consumption.1

## Global Shortage

Rapid industrialization and increasing agricultural use have contributed to worldwide water shortages. Areas that have experienced lack of H2O include China, Egypt, India, Israel, Pakistan, Mexico, parts of Africa and the United States (Colorado, California, Las Vegas and the East Coast), to name but a few.

Pollution also highlights the need for clean water. In the U.S., the dead zone off the Gulf Coast highlights the impact of fertilizer runoff,2 and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), an additive in unleaded gasoline, can be found in well water from California to Maryland.3 Overseas, highly publicized incidents in Russia, China, and elsewhere demonstrate that pollution isn't limited to the West. Of course, fouled water supplies further limit the amount of freshwater available for human use.

## Indexes

Here are some of the more popular [[indexes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) designed to track various water-related investment opportunities:

-   _The Dow Jones U.S. Water Index_ is composed of approximately 29 stocks; it is a [[barometer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barometer.asp) consisting of a large number of international and domestic companies that are affiliated with the water business and have a minimum [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $150 million.4
-   _The ISE-B&S Water Index_ was launched in January 2006, and this index represents water distribution, water filtration, flow technology, and other companies that specialize in water-related solutions. It contains over 35 stocks.4
-   _The S&P 1500 Water Utilities Index_ is a sub-sector of the [[Standard & Poor's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp) 1500 Utilities Index; this index is composed of just two companies, American States Water (NYSE:[AWR](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=awr)) and Aqua America (NYSE: [[WTR]](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=wtr)).4
-   _The S&P Global Water Index_ is an 11-year-old index that contains 50 companies around the world; their water-related businesses fall into two areas: [[utilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utilities_sector.asp) and [[infrastructure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp), and equipment and materials.5

The Bloomberg World Water Index and the MSCI World Water Index provide a look at the water industry from an international perspective, although it can be rather difficult to find current information about either index.6 There are also a variety of utility indexes that include some water stocks.

## How To Invest in Water Commodities

A look at the [[holdings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdings.asp) of any of the water indexes provides an easy way to begin your search for suitable investment opportunities. Companies from [[blue-chip]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechip.asp) [[stalwart]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalwart.asp) General Electric to [[small-cap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp) Layne Christensen are all seeking a piece of the water market. In addition to direct stock purchases, some of the larger firms offer [[dividend reinvestment plans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp). Firms seeking to profit from water-related businesses include beverage providers, utilities, water treatment/purification firms and equipment makers, such as those that provide pumps, valves, and desalination units.

When it comes to bottled water, the market is growing internationally. Demand is on the rise from China to Mexico, following in the footsteps of the spike in U.S. consumer demand. Estimates suggest that from 2007 to 2017 American [[per-capita]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percapita.asp) consumption of bottled water increased 45% – the average American drinks approximately 42 gallons of bottled water a year.7 On the desalination front, some 150 countries currently rely on desalination for at least part of their freshwater consumption needs.8

If [[stock picking]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp) doesn't interest you, [[ETFs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp), [[mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp), and [[unit investment trusts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp) (UITs) also provide plenty of opportunities to invest in water. The Invesco Water Resource Portfolio ETF ([PHO](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=pho)) is the largest, with a U.S.-centric basket of 34 holdings (as of March 2020) that tilts toward mid- and smaller-cap companies.9 The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Index ETF ([IDU](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=idu)) provides some exposure to water-related stocks.10 Other new alternatives include the Invesco Global Water Portfolio ETF ([PIO](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=pio)), which tracks the [[Nasdaq]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) OMX Global Water Index,11 and the First Trust ISE Water Index Fund ([FIW](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=fiw)).12 Based on popularity, new alternatives are slowly emerging.

Additionally, two-unit investment trusts that specialize in water-related investments are the Claymore-Boenning & Scattergood Global Water Equities UIT and the Claymore-Boenning & Scattergood U.S. Water Equities portfolio.13

## The Bottom Line

Recent years have seen an upswing in the demand for investments that seek to profit from the need for fresh, clean water. If the trend continues – and by all indications, it will – investors can expect to see a host of new investments that provide exposure to this precious commodity and to the firms that deliver it to the marketplace. There are currently numerous ways to add water exposure to your portfolio; most simply require a bit of research. Opportunities to invest in this scarce resource are flowing freely, so dive in!
