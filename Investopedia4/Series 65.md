[[Series 65]]
Designed by the [[North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasaa.asp) and administered by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp), the [[Series 65]] is an exam and securities license required for individuals to act as investment advisers in the US. The Series 65 exam, known formally as the Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination, covers laws, regulations, ethics, and various topics important to the role of a financial adviser.

## Understanding the [[Series 65]]

Successful completion of the [[Series 65]] exam qualifies an investment professional to function as an Investment Adviser Representative in certain states. Other FINRA-administered qualification examinations include the [[Series 3]] National Commodities [[Futures]] (NCFE), Series 7 General Securities Representative (GS), and [[Series 63]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series63.asp) Uniform Securities Agent State Law.

Financial professionals who have successfully passed the [[Series 65]] exam may not act as investment advisers until licensed and registered in their state.

NASAA has completed the update of questions on the [[Series 63]], 65, and 66 exams in light of the 2018 changes to the tax code. Tax-related questions appearing on the exams starting in Jan. 2019 reflect the tax code changes. To sit for the [[Series 65]] exam, a candidate does not require sponsorship by a member firm.

## [[Series 65]] Exam Structure

The [[Series 65]] examination contains 130 multiple-choice questions. Candidates have 180 minutes to complete the exam. Candidates must get 94 of the 130 questions correct to pass (a score of 72.3%).

Test takers are provided with a basic four-function electronic calculator. Only this calculator may be used during the exam. Dry-erase boards and markers are also provided for candidates. No reference materials of any kind are permitted in the exam room, and there are severe penalties for those who are caught cheating or attempting to cheat.
