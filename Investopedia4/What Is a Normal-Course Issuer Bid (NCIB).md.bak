## [[What Is a Normal-Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)]]?

A normal-course issuer bid is a Canadian term for a public company's repurchase of its own [[Stock|stock]] in order to cancel it. A company is allowed to repurchase between 5% and 10% of its [[Shares|shares]] depending on how the transaction is conducted.

### Key Takeaways

-   An NCIB is a [[Stock|stock]] buyback program used by companies [[Listed|listed]] in Canada.
-   The NCIB is used to raise cash, force the share price higher, ward off a takeover, or some combination of all of these.
-   The NCIB must be approved in advance by the exchanges.

The issuer repurchases the [[Shares|shares]] gradually over a period of time, such as one year. This repurchasing strategy allows the company to buy only when its [[Stock|stock]] is favorably priced.

## Understanding the NCIB

Public companies operating in Canada must file a Notice of Intention to Make an NCIB with the [[Stock|stock]] exchanges they are [[Listed|listed]] on and receive their approval before proceeding with a repurchase. There are limits on the number of [[Shares|shares]] the company can repurchase in a single day.

In another type of approved issuer bid, a company [[Will|will]] repurchase a set number of [[Shares|shares]] from its [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) at a predetermined date and price.

If a company repurchases all of its outstanding [[Shares|shares]] in this manner, it is called a [[going private]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/going-private.asp) transaction.

### Ways an NCIB Can Be Used

Once an NCIB is approved, the company can proceed with repurchases as it sees fit during the period that has been established. The company might or might not repurchase the full number of [[Shares|shares]] it is permitted to buy.

An NCIB is launched when a company's executives believe its [[Stock|stock]] is undervalued in the market.

As with any [[Stock|stock]] repurchase program, a company undertakes an NCIB because its executives believe that the company's publicly traded stock [[Shares|shares]] are undervalued. By taking back shares, they are reducing the numbers available on the market. Their own buying activity reduces [[Supply|supply]] and raises demand, leading the price higher.

Once the value of [[Shares|shares]] rises to the desired level, the company might sell off part of its stake in order to raise cash, increase [[Liquidity|liquidity]], and widen its base of investors.

Through a normal-course issuer bid, a company can take advantage of what it sees as a discount on the [[Stock|stock]]’s current price.

### Regaining Control

An NCIB can also be a tactic designed to ward off a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]] attempt. In such cases, the company is reducing the volume of its [[Shares|shares]] that are available on the market and regaining more control over its own [[Stock|stock]].

If the repurchase is big enough it can change the concentration and makeup of [[Stock|stock]] ownership. The company may end up with a controlling interest that cannot be challenged by a [[Third Party|third party]]. Once this happens, the company can maintain its control by simply releasing too few new [[Shares|shares]] to allow any single buyer to accumulate enough shares to affect shareholder votes or force its agenda on the company's board of directors.
