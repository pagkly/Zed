[[Underinvestment Problem]]
## What Is the [[Underinvestment Problem]]?

The [[Underinvestment Problem|underinvestment problem]] is an [[agency problem]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencyproblem.asp) proposed by financial economists that exists between shareholders and [[Debt|debt]] holders, in which a [[leveraged]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp) company foregoes valuable investment opportunities because debt holders would capture a portion of the benefits of the project, leaving insufficient returns to the [[Equity|equity]] shareholders.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Underinvestment Problem|underinvestment problem]] describes a conundrum whereby a company becomes so [[Overleveraged|overleveraged]] that it can no longer make investments in growth opportunities.
-   Economists recognize this situation as an agency problem that can arise between a firm's [[Debt|debt]] holders and [[Equity|equity]] shareholders.
-   [[Debt Overhang|Debt overhang]], both in terms of corporations and governments, is a form of the [[Underinvestment Problem|underinvestment problem]] that negatively impacts either shareholders or a nation's citizens.

## The [[Underinvestment Problem]] Explained

Potential conflicts of interest between managers, stockholders, and debtholders influence capital structure, corporate governance activities, and investment policies. These types of agency problems, in turn, can give rise to inefficient managerial decisions and “suboptimal” investments that generally fall under the categories of problems of underinvestment and overinvestment.

The [[Underinvestment Problem|underinvestment problem]] in corporate [[Finance|finance]] theory is credited to Stewart C. Myers of the Sloan School at MIT, who in his "Determinants of Corporate Borrowing" article (1977) in the _Journal of Financial Economics_ hypothesized that "a firm with risky [[Debt|debt]] outstanding, and which acts in its stockholders' interest, [[Will|will]] follow a different decision rule than one which can issue [[Risk|risk]]-free debt or which issues no debt at all."

Myers adds that "the firm financed with risky [[Debt|debt]] [[Will|will]], in some states of nature, pass up valuable investment opportunities—opportunities which could make a positive net contribution to the market value of the firm."

The [[Underinvestment Problem|underinvestment problem]] moves into focus when a firm frequently passes up [[net present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) (NPV) projects because the managers, acting on behalf of shareholders, believe that creditors would benefit more than owners. If cash flows from a prospective investment go to creditors, then there would be no incentive to [[Equity|equity]] holders to proceed with the investment. Such an investment would increase the overall value of the firm, but it does not happen—hence, there is a "problem."

## Contradicting the Modigliani-Miller Theorem

The [[Underinvestment Problem|underinvestment problem]] theory is at conflict with the theoretical assumption in the [[Modigliani-Miller theorem]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modigliani-millertheorem.asp) that investment decisions can be made independent of financing decisions. Managers of a leveraged company, Myers argues, do in fact take into consideration the amount of [[Debt|debt]] that needs to be serviced when evaluating a new investment project.

According to Myers, the value of the firm can be influenced by financing decisions, in contradiction to Modigliani-Miller's central tenet.

## The [[Underinvestment Problem]] and [[Debt Overhang]]

One instance of the [[Underinvestment Problem|underinvestment problem]] is known as a [[debt overhang]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtoverhang.asp). When a firm has a very large level of [[Debt|debt]], there comes a point when it can no longer borrow from creditors any longer. The debt burden is so large, in fact, that any and all earnings that come into the company immediately go directly to paying off existing debt instead of going into new investments or projects, limiting the growth of the company. It leads to underinvestment in the firm. As a result, shareholders lose out both to creditors in the present and to future lost growth potential as well.

[[Debt]] overhangs also apply to national governments, where the sovereign debt of a nation exceeds its future capacity to repay it. A [[Debt Overhang|debt overhang]] can lead to stagnant growth and the degradation of [living standards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp) from underinvestment in critical areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
