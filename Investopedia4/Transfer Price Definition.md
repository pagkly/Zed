[[Transfer Price Definition]]
## What Is a Transfer Price?

Transfer price is the price at which [[related parties]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/related-partytransaction.asp) transact with each other, such as during the trade of supplies or labor between departments. Transfer prices are used when individual entities of a larger multi-entity firm are treated and measured as separately run entities. It is common for multi-entity corporations to be consolidated on a financial reporting basis; however, they may report each entity separately for tax purposes.

A transfer price can also be known as a transfer cost.

### Key Takeaways

-   Transfer prices that differ from market value [[Will|will]] be advantageous for one entity, while lowering the profits of the other entity.
-   Multinational companies can manipulate transfer prices in order to shift profits to low tax regions.
-   To remedy this, regulations enforce an arm's length transaction rule that requires pricing to be based on similar transactions done between unrelated parties.

## How Transfer Prices Work

A transfer price arises for accounting purposes when related parties, such as divisions within a company or a company and its subsidiary, report their own [[profits]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp). When these related parties are required to transact with each other, a transfer price is used to determine costs. Transfer prices generally do not differ much from the [[market price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp). If the price does differ, then one of the entities is at a disadvantage and would ultimately start buying from the market to get a better price.

For example, assume entity A and entity B are two unique segments of Company ABC. Entity A builds and sells wheels, and entity B assembles and sells bicycles. Entity A may also sell wheels to entity B through an intracompany transaction. If entity A offers entity B a rate lower than market value, entity B [[Will|will]] have a lower [[cost of goods sold]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp) (COGS) and higher [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) than it otherwise would have. However, doing so would also hurt entity A's sales [[revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp).

If, on the other hand, entity A offers entity B a rate higher than market value, then entity A would have higher sales revenue than it would have if it sold to an external customer. Entity B would have higher COGS and lower profits. In either situation, one entity benefits while the other is hurt by a transfer price that varies from market value.

Regulations on [[Transfer Pricing|transfer pricing]] ensure the fairness and accuracy of transfer pricing among related entities. Regulations enforce an [[arm’s length transaction]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/armslength.asp) rule that states that companies must establish pricing based on similar transactions done between unrelated parties. It is closely monitored within a company’s financial reporting.

[[Transfer Pricing|Transfer pricing]] requires strict documentation that is included in the [[footnotes to the financial statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/footnote.asp) for review by auditors, regulators, and investors. This documentation is closely scrutinized. If inappropriately documented, it can burden the company with added [[Taxation|taxation]] or restatement fees. These prices are closely checked for accuracy to ensure that profits are booked appropriately within arm's length pricing methods and associated taxes are paid accordingly.

## Special Consideration

### International [[Taxation]] and Transfer Prices

Transfer prices are used when divisions sell goods in intracompany transactions to divisions in other international jurisdictions. A large part of international [[Commerce|commerce]] is actually done within companies as opposed to between unrelated companies. Intercompany transfers done internationally have tax advantages, which has led regulatory authorities to frown upon using [[Transfer Pricing|transfer pricing]] for tax avoidance.

When [[Transfer Pricing|transfer pricing]] occurs, companies can manipulate profits of goods and services, in order to book higher profits in another country that may have a lower tax rate. In some cases, the transfer of goods and services from one country to another within an intracompany transaction can also allow a company to avoid tariffs on goods and services exchanged internationally. The international tax laws are regulated by the [[Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oecd.asp) (OECD), and auditing firms within each international location audit the [[financial statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) accordingly.

## Example of [[Transfer Pricing]]

To better understand the effect of [[Transfer Pricing|transfer pricing]] on [[Taxation|taxation]], let's take the example above with entity A and entity B. Assume entity A is in a high tax country, while entity B is in a low tax country. It would benefit the organization as a whole for more of the Company ABC's profits to appear in entity B's division, where the company [[Will|will]] pay lower taxes.

In that case, the Company ABC may attempt to have entity A [[Offer|offer]] a transfer price lower than market value to entity B when selling them the wheels needed to build the bicycles. As explained above, entity B would then have a lower cost of goods sold (COGS) and higher earnings, and entity A would have reduced sales revenue and lower total earnings.

Companies [[Will|will]] attempt to shift a major part of such economic activity to low-cost destinations to save on taxes. This practice continues to be a major point of discord between the various multinational companies and tax authorities like the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp). The various tax authorities each have the goal to increase taxes paid in their region, while the company has the goal to reduce overall taxes.
