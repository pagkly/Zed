[[Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)]]
## What Is a [[Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)]]?

A [[Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)|collateralized loan obligation (CLO)]] is a single [[Security|security]] backed by a pool of [[Debt|debt]]. The process of pooling assets into a marketable security is called [[securitization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitization.asp). Collateralized [[Loan|loan]] obligations (CLO) are often backed by corporate loans with low credit ratings or loans taken out by private [[Equity|equity]] firms to conduct [[leveraged buyouts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp). A collateralized loan obligation is similar to a [[collateralized mortgage obligation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmo.asp) (CMO), except that the [[Underlying|underlying]] debt is of a different type and character—a company loan instead of a mortgage.

With a CLO, the investor receives scheduled [[Debt|debt]] payments from the [[Underlying|underlying]] loans, assuming most of the [[Risk|risk]] in the event that borrowers [[Default|default]]. In exchange for taking on the [[Default Risk|default risk]], the investor is offered greater diversity and the potential for higher-than-average returns. A [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) is when a borrower fails to make payments on a [[Loan|loan]] or mortgage for an extended period of time.

#### [[Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)]]

## How Collateralized [[Loan]] Obligations (CLO) Work

Loans—usually first-[[Lien|lien]] bank loans to businesses—that are ranked below investment grade are initially sold to a CLO manager who bundles multiple (generally 100 to 225) loans together and manages the consolidations, actively buying and selling loans. To fund the purchase of new [[Debt|debt]], the CLO manager sells stakes in the CLO to outside investors in a structure called [[tranches]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/[[Tranches|tranches]].asp). Each tranche is a piece of the CLO, and it dictates who [[Will|will]] be paid out first when the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Loan|loan]] payments are made. It also dictates the [[Risk|risk]] associated with the investment since investors who are paid last have a higher risk of [[Default|default]] from the underlying loans. Investors who are paid out first have lower overall risk, but they receive smaller interest payments, as a result. Investors who are in later tranches may be paid last, but the interest payments are higher to compensate for the risk.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)|collateralized loan obligation (CLO)]] is a single [[Security|security]] backed by a pool of [[Debt|debt]].
-   CLOs are often corporate loans with low credit ratings or loans taken out by private [[Equity|equity]] firms to conduct leveraged buyouts.
-   With a CLO, the investor receives scheduled [[Debt|debt]] payments from the [[Underlying|underlying]] loans, assuming most of the [[Risk|risk]] if borrowers [[Default|default]].

There are two types of [[Tranches|tranches]]: [[Debt|debt]] tranches and [[Equity|equity]] tranches. Debt tranches are treated just like bonds and have credit ratings and coupon payments. These debt tranches are always in the front of the line in terms of [[repayment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp), although within the debt tranches, there is also a pecking order. Equity tranches do not have credit ratings and are paid out after all debt tranches. Equity tranches are rarely paid a [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] but do [[Offer|offer]] ownership in the CLO itself in the event of a sale.

A CLO is an actively managed instrument: managers can—and do—buy and sell individual bank loans in the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Collateral|collateral]] pool in an effort to score gains and minimize losses. In addition, most of a CLO's [[Debt|debt]] is backed by high-quality collateral, making liquidation less likely, and making it better equipped to withstand market [[Volatility|volatility]].

CLOs [[Offer|offer]] higher-than-average returns because an investor is assuming more [[Risk|risk]] by buying low-rated [[Debt|debt]].

## Special Considerations for CLOs

Some argue that a CLO isn't that risky. A study by Guggenheim Investments, an asset management firm, found that from 1994 to 2013, CLOs experienced significantly lower [[Default|default]] rates than corporate bonds. Even so, they are sophisticated investments, and typically, only large institutional investors purchase [[Tranches|tranches]] in a CLO. In other words, companies of scale, such as insurance companies, quickly purchase senior level [[Debt|debt]] tranches to ensure low [[Risk|risk]] and steady [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]. Mutual funds and ETFs normally purchase [[junior-level debt tranches]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junior-debt.asp) with higher risk and higher interest payments. If an individual investor invests in a mutual fund with junior debt tranches, that investor takes on the proportional risk of default.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a [[Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)]]?

A [[Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)]] is a type of [[Security|security]] that allows investors to purchase an interest in a diversified [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of company loans. The company selling the CLO [[Will|will]] purchase a large number of corporate loans from borrowers such as private companies and [[private equity firms]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp), and will then package those loans into a single CLO security. The CLO is then sold off to investors in a variety of pieces, called “[[Tranches|tranches]]”, with each tranche [[Offering|offering]] its own [[Risk|risk]]-reward characteristics.

### What is the difference between a [[Debt|debt]] tranche and an [[Equity|equity]] tranche?

There are two main types of [[tranches]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/[[Tranches|tranches]].asp) used when selling a CLO: [[Debt|debt]] tranches and [[Equity|equity]] tranches. Debt tranches are those that [[Offer|offer]] the investor a specified stream of interest and [[Principal|principal]] payments, similar to those offered by other debt instruments such as debentures or corporate bonds. Equity tranches, on the other hand, do not pay scheduled cashflows to the investor, but instead offer a share of the value of the CLO if the CLO is re-sold in the future. Within each of these categories, many different tranches might be available, with the riskier tranches [[Offering|offering]] higher potential returns.

### What is the difference between a CLO and a [[Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO)]]?

CLOs are similar to [[Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmo.asp), in that both securities are based on a large [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Debt|debt]] instruments. The main difference between them, however, is that CLOs are based on debts owed by corporations, whereas CMOs are based on mortgage loans. Both CLOs and CMOs are examples of [[credit derivatives]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditderivative.asp).
