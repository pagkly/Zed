Value Proposition: Why Consumers Should Buy a Product or Use a Service
## What Is a Value Proposition?

A value proposition refers to the value a company promises to deliver to customers should they choose to buy their product. A value proposition is part of a company's overall [[marketing strategy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing-strategy.asp). The value proposition provides a declaration of intent or a statement that introduces a company's brand to consumers by telling them what the company stands for, how it operates, and why it deserves their business.

A value proposition can be presented as a business or marketing statement that a company uses to summarize why a consumer should buy a product or use a [[service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/service-sector.asp). This statement, if worded compellingly, convinces a potential consumer that one particular product or service the company offers [[Will|will]] [[add more value]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/what-are-elements-effective-value-proposition.asp) or better solve a problem for them than other similar offerings will.

### Key Takeaways

-   A company's value proposition tells a customer the number one reason why a product or service is best suited for that particular customer.
-   A value proposition should be communicated to customers directly, either via the company's website or other marketing or advertising materials.
-   Value propositions can follow different formats, as long as they are "on brand," unique, and specific to the company in question.
-   A successful value proposition should be persuasive and help turn a prospect into a paying customer.

## Understanding a Value Proposition

A value proposition stands as a promise by a company to a customer or [[market segment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-segment.asp). The proposition is an easy-to-understand reason why a customer should buy a product or service from that particular business. A value proposition should clearly explain how a product fills a need, communicate the specifics of its added benefit, and state the reason why it's better than similar products on the market. The ideal value proposition is to-the-point and appeals to a customer's strongest decision-making drivers.

Companies use this statement to target customers who [[Will|will]] benefit most from using the company's products, and this helps maintain a company's [[economic moat]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp). An economic moat is a competitive advantage. The term—coined by super-investor [Warren Buffett](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp) of Berkshire Hathaway—states that the wider the moat, the bigger and more resilient the firm is to competition.

A great value proposition demonstrates what a brand has to [[Offer|offer]] a customer that no other competitor has and how a service or product fulfills a need that no other company is able to fill.

## Requirements of a Value Proposition

A company's value proposition communicates the number one reason why a product or service is best suited for a customer segment. Therefore, it should always be displayed prominently on a company's website and in other consumer touch points. It also must be intuitive, so that a customer can read or hear the [[value proposition]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111014/basics-value-chain-analysis.asp) and understand the delivered value without needing further explanation.

Value propositions that stand out tend to make use of a particular structure. A successful value proposition typically has a strong, clear headline that communicates the delivered benefit to the consumer. The headline should be a single memorable sentence, phrase, or even a tagline. It frequently incorporates catchy slogans that become part of [[successful advertising campaigns]](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1111/8-of-the-most-successful-ad-campaigns-of-all-time.aspx).

Often a subheadline [[Will|will]] be provided underneath the main headline, expanding on the explanation of delivered value and giving a specific example of why the product or service is superior to others the consumer has in mind. The subheading can be a short paragraph and is typically between two and three sentences long. The subheading is a way to highlight the key features or benefits of the products and often benefits from the inclusion of bullet points or another means of highlighting standout details.

This kind of structure allows consumers to scan the value proposition quickly and pick up on product features. Added visuals increase the ease of communication between business and consumer. In order to craft a strong value proposition, companies [[Will|will]] often conduct [[market research]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-research.asp) to determine which messages resonate the best with their customers.

## Special Considerations

Value propositions can follow different formats as long as they are unique to the company and to the consumers the company services. All effective value propositions are easy to understand and demonstrate specific results for a customer using a product or service. They differentiate a product or service from any competition, avoid overused marketing [[buzzwords]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buzzword-bingo.asp), and communicate value within a short amount of time. For a value proposition to effectively turn a prospect into a paying customer, it should clearly identify who the customers are, what their main problems are, and how the company's product or service is the ideal solution to help them solve their problem.
