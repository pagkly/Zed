[[Restricted Stock]]
## What Is [[Restricted Stock]]?

[[Restricted Stock|Restricted stock]] refers to unregistered [[Shares|shares]] of ownership in a corporation that are issued to corporate affiliates, such as executives and directors. Restricted [[Stock|stock]] is non-transferable and must be traded in compliance with special Securities and Exchange [[Commission]] (SEC) regulations.

The restrictions are intended to deter premature selling that might adversely affect the company. It typically becomes available for sale under a [[graded vesting schedule]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graded-vesting.asp) that lasts several years. [[Restricted Stock|Restricted stock]] is also referred to as "letter [[Stock|stock]]" and "section 1244 stock."

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Restricted Stock|Restricted stock]] is a form of executive compensation where non-transferable [[Shares|shares]] are issued to employees that come with conditions on the timing of the sale.
-   The restrictions include a vesting period that may last several years, on the condition that the employee [[Will|will]] continue working at the company for a number of years or until a particular company milestone is met.
-   The use of [[Restricted Stock|restricted stock]] is most common in established companies that want to motivate employees by giving them a share of the [[Equity|equity]].

#### Types Of [[Shares]]: Authorized, Outstanding, Float And Restricted Shares

## How [[Restricted Stock]] Works

Restricted [[Shares|shares]] give an employee interest in their company [[Stock|stock]] but these have no tangible value until vesting is complete. The [[Restricted Stock|restricted stock]] units are assigned a fair market value when they vest. Vesting, or restricting the sale of the stock, is intended to align the interests of the recipient with that of the firm and its stakeholders, and to ensure that certain milestones are met.

[[Restricted Stock|Restricted stock]] became more popular in the mid-2000s as companies were required to expense [[Stock Option|stock option]] grants. It is often used as a form of employee compensation, in which case, it typically becomes transferrable, that is, vests, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as continued employment for a period of time or the achievement of particular product-development milestones, [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS) goals, or other financial targets.

Insiders are given [[Restricted Stock|restricted stock]] after merger and acquisition activity, underwriting activity, and [[affiliate ownership]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/subsidiaries.asp) in order to prevent premature selling that might adversely affect the company. An executive may have to [[forfeit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forfeited-share.asp) restricted [[Stock|stock]] if he leaves the company, fails to meet corporate or personal performance goals, or runs afoul of SEC trading restrictions. The SEC regulations that govern the trading of restricted stock are outlined under SEC [[Rule 144]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule144.asp), which describes the registration and public trading of restricted stock and the limits on holding periods and volume.1

An executive may have to give up [[Restricted Stock|restricted stock]] should they leave the company, miss certain pre-specified performance targets, or get in trouble with the Securities and Exchange [[Commission]].

These [[Shares|shares]] may also come with a double-trigger provision. That means that an employee's shares become unrestricted if the company is acquired by another and the employee is fired in the restructuring that follows.

## [[Restricted Stock]] Units (RSUs) vs. Restricted [[Stock]] Awards

Two variations on [[Restricted Stock|restricted stock]] are [[restricted stock units]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-[[Stock|stock]]-unit.asp) (RSUs) and restricted stock awards. A restricted stock unit is a promise made to an employee by an employer to [[Grant|grant]] a given number of [[Shares|shares]] of the company's stock to the employee at a predetermined time in the future. Since RSUs are not actually [[Stocks|stocks]], but only a right to the promised stock, they carry no [[voting rights]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp). An RSU must be exercised in order to receive the stock. An RSU that is converted to a stock carries the standard voting rights for the class of stock issued.

A [[Restricted Stock|restricted stock]] award is similar to an RSU in a number of ways, except for the fact that the award also comes with voting rights. This is because the employee owns the [[Stock|stock]] immediately once it is awarded. Generally, an RSU represents stock, but in some cases, an employee can elect to receive the cash value of the RSU in lieu of a stock award. This is not the case for restricted stock awards, which cannot be redeemed for cash.

## [[Taxation]] of [[Restricted Stock]]

The [[taxation of restricted stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/restricted-[[Stock|stock]]-tax.asp) is complex and is governed by [[Section 1244]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-1244-stock.asp) of the [[Internal Revenue Code]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internal-revenue-code.asp) (IRC). Restricted stockholders pay tax on the [[capital gain]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp) [[or loss]](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/capital-gains-tax-101/) represented by the difference between the stock’s price on the date it vests and the date it is sold. In addition, [[Restricted Stock|restricted stock]] is taxable as [[Ordinary Income|ordinary income]] in the year it vests. This is converse to stock options which are taxed when the employee exercises his or her option, not when they are vested.2

The amount on [[Restricted Stock|restricted stock]] that must be declared as income is the [[Stock|stock]]’s [[fair market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp) on the vesting date minus its original [[exercise price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp). However, the restricted stockholder may do a [[Section 83(b) election]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/83b-election.asp), which lets him or her use the price on the [[Grant|grant]] date, not the vesting date, for the purposes of calculating [[Ordinary Income|ordinary income]] tax. The tax bill must be paid sooner in this case, but it may be substantially lower if the stock appreciates between the grant date and the vesting date. The [[Risk|risk]] of taking this election is that if the restricted stockholder leaves the company before the [[Shares|shares]] vest, the shares are forfeited, and taxes already paid are non-refundable.
