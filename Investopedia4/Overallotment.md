[[Overallotment]]
## What Is an [[Overallotment]]?

An [[Overallotment|overallotment]] is an option commonly available to [[underwriters]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp) that allows the sale of additional [[Shares|shares]] that a company plans to issue in an [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) or secondary/follow-on [[Offering|offering]]. An overallotment option allows underwriters to issue as many as 15% more shares than originally planned. The option can be exercised within 30 days of the offering, and it does not have to be exercised on the same day.

It is also called a "[greenshoe option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenshoe.asp)."

## [[Overallotment]] Explained

The underwriters of such an [[Offering|offering]] may elect to exercise the [[Overallotment|overallotment]] option when demand for [[Shares|shares]] is high and shares are trading above the [[offering price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offeringprice.asp). This scenario allows the issuing company to raise additional capital.

Other times, the purpose of issuing extra [[Shares|shares]] is to stabilize the price of the [[Stock|stock]] and prevent it from going below the [[Offering Price|offering price]]. If the stock price drops below the [[Offering|offering]] price, the underwriters can buy back some of the shares for less than they were sold for, decreasing the [[Supply|supply]] and hopefully increasing the price. If the stock rises above the offering price, the [[Overallotment|overallotment]] agreement allows the underwriters to buy back the excess shares at the offering price, so that they don't lose money.

## Example of an [[Overallotment]]

In March 2017, Snap Inc. offered 200 million [[Shares|shares]] at $17.00 per share in a much-anticipated IPO. Shortly after placing the original 200 million shares, the underwriters exercised their [[Overallotment|overallotment]] option to push another 30 million shares in the market.1
