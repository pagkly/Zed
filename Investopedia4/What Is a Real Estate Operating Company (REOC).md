[[What Is a Real Estate Operating Company (REOC)]]?
## [[What Is a Real Estate Operating Company (REOC)]]?

The term real [[Estate|estate]] operating company (REOC) refers to a company that engages in [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/intro-to-investment-real-estate/) investments and whose [[Shares|shares]] are traded on a public exchange. These publicly-traded companies own and actively invest in properties—generally commercial real estate. Unlike [[real estate investment trusts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) (REITs), REOCs reinvest the money they earn back into their business and are subject to higher corporate taxes than REITs.

### Key Takeaways

-   A real [[Estate|estate]] operating company engages in real estate investments and trades on a public exchange.
-   REOCs can reinvest their earnings back into the business rather than distribute them to unitholders the same way REITs are compelled to do.
-   REOCs have the potential for greater growth prospects than REITs but they might not generate as much immediate income.

## How Real [[Estate]] Operating Companies (REOCs) Work

[Investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) have a number of options if they wish to diversify their [[Holdings|holdings]] and add real [[Estate|estate]] to their [[portfolios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp). Purchasing [[Real Property|real property]] is one option, but that can come at a big cost and immense [[risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]].asp). Investors who buy properties—residential and/or commercial real estate—must be able to bear the financial burden of purchasing and maintaining properties in addition to the risks and uncertainties that come with the [[housing market]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040215/how-does-law-[[Supply|supply]]-and-demand-affect-housing-market.asp).

Real [[Estate|estate]] operating companies are an alternative to owning [[real property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-property.asp). These companies can shield investors from some of the risks that come with holding physical real estate. REOCs are companies that purchase and actively invest in different types of real estate. The majority of their [[Holdings|holdings]] are [[commercial properties]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercial-property.asp) such as retail stores, hotels, office buildings, shopping malls, and multifamily homes. Many REOCs also invest in and manage properties. For instance, a company may sell or [[Lease|lease]] out units of a [[multifamily home]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/041216/3-reasons-invest-multifamily-real-estate.asp) or office building to different people but still maintain and earn money from common spaces such as parking lots and lobbies.

[Shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Shares|shares]].asp) in REOCs are traded on exchanges just like any other publicly-traded company. Investors can purchase shares through their [[broker-dealer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp) or another financial professional. Although they eliminate the [[Risk|risk]] of holding physical property, REOCs are subject to certain market risks including interest rate risk, housing market risks, [[liquidity risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityrisk.asp), and [[credit risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp).

REOCs are structured in a way that allows them to reinvest their [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) back into the company rather than distribute them to [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp). As such, they can expand their [[holdings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Holdings|holdings]].asp) by purchasing new properties or putting money back into existing holdings to improve them. They may also use earnings to buy new properties for the express purpose to sell them back at a later date. Being able to reinvest their earnings means REOCs get no favorable tax treatment, so they pay higher taxes than REITs.

Real [[Estate|estate]] operating companies pay federal taxes because they are not required to distribute their earnings to shareholders.

## Real [[Estate]] Operating Company (REOC) vs. REIT

Although they both invest in [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp) [[Holdings|holdings]], there are functional and strategic differences between REOCs and REITs. REITs own and operate properties that generate [[income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp) through rents or leases. These may be residential dwellings, hotels, and even [[infrastructure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp) properties such as pipelines and cell phone towers. Investors can choose to buy [[Shares|shares]] in three different types of REITs—[[Equity|equity]] REITs, mortgage REITs, and hybrid REITs.

In order to qualify as a REIT, companies must meet certain requirements. These include—among others—investing a minimum of 75% of their [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) in real [[Estate|estate]] and distributing at least 90% of their earnings as distributions to [[unitholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Unitholder|unitholder]].asp). In exchange, REITs get favorable tax treatment. Corporate taxes for REITs are far lower than those imposed on REOCs because they are exempt from federal [[taxation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/[[Taxation|taxation]].asp).1

REITs tend to invest and purchase properties that limit the amount of [[Risk|risk]] associated with certain commercial properties because of the special tax status they enjoy. Their investment strategies tend to be for the long-term. This means REITs don't purchase [[investment properties]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-property.asp) in order to sell them in the future the same way some REOCs do.
