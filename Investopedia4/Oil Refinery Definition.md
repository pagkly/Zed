[[Oil Refinery Definition]]
## What Is an Oil Refinery?

An oil refinery is an industrial plant that transforms, or refines [[crude oil]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crude-oil.asp) into various usable [[Petroleum|petroleum]] products such as diesel, gasoline and heating oils. Oil refineries essentially serve as the second stage in the [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] production process following the actual extraction of crude oil [[up-stream]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Upstream|upstream]].asp), and refinery services are considered to be a [[down-stream]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downstream.asp) segment of the oil and gas industry.

The first step in the refining process is distillation, where [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] is heated at extreme temperatures to separate the different [[hydrocarbons]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hydrocarbon.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   An oil refinery is a facility that takes [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] and distills it into various useful [[Petroleum|petroleum]] products such as gasoline, kerosene or jet fuel.
-   Refining is classified as a downstream operation of the oil and gas industry, although many integrated oil companies [[Will|will]] operate both extraction and refining services.
-   Refineries and oil traders look to the crack spread_—_the relative difference in production cost and market price_—_of various [[Petroleum|petroleum]] products in the derivatives market to [[Hedge|hedge]] their exposure to [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] prices.

## Understanding Oil Refineries

Oil refineries serve an important role in the production of transportation and other fuels. The [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] components, once separated, can be sold to different industries for a broad range of purposes. Lubricants can be sold to industrial plants immediately after distillation, but other products require more refining before reaching the final user. Major refineries have the capacity to process hundreds of thousand barrels of crude oil daily.

In the industry, the refining process is commonly called the "downstream" sector, while raw [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] production is known as the "[[Upstream|upstream]]" sector. The term downstream is associated with the concept that oil is sent down the product value chain to an oil refinery to be processed into fuel. The downstream stage also includes the actual sale of [[Petroleum|petroleum]] products to other businesses, governments or private individuals.

According to the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration (EIA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/energy-information-admin.asp), U.S. refineries produce_—_from a 42-gallon barrel of crude oil_—_19 to 20 gallons of motor gasoline, 11 to 12 gallons of distillate fuel (most of which is sold as diesel) and four gallons of jet fuel.1 More than a dozen other [[Petroleum|petroleum]] products are also produced in refineries. Petroleum refineries produce liquids the petrochemical industry uses to make a variety of chemicals and plastics.

## Cracking [[Crude Oil]]

An oil refinery runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and requires a large number of employees. Refineries come offline or stop working for a few weeks each year to undergo seasonal maintenance and other repair work. A refinery can occupy as much land as several hundred football fields. Famous oil refining companies include the [[Koch Pipeline Company]](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/companies-owned-koch-brothers/), and many others.

Crack or crack spread is a trading strategy used in [energy futures](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/energy_market.asp) to establish a refining [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp). Crack is one primary indicator of oil refining companies' earnings. Crack allows refining companies to [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) against the risks associated with [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] and those associated with [[Petroleum|petroleum]] products. By simultaneously purchasing crude oil [[Futures|futures]] and selling petroleum product futures, a trader is attempting to establish an artificial position in the refinement of oil created through a spread.

The [[Nelson Complexity Index (NCI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nelson-index.asp) is a measure of the sophistication of an oil refinery, where more complex refineries are able to produce lighter, more heavily refined and valuable products from a barrel of oil.

The proportions of [[Petroleum|petroleum]] products a refinery produces from [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] can also affect crack spreads. Some of these products include asphalt, aviation fuel, diesel, gasoline and kerosene. In some cases, the proportion produced varies based on [demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp) from the local market. 

The mix of products also depends on the kind of [[Crude Oil|crude oil]] processed. Heavier crude oils are more difficult to refine into lighter products like gasoline. Refineries that use simpler refining processes may be restricted in their ability to produce products from heavy crude oil.

## Refinery Services

Oil refining is a purely downstream function, although many of the companies doing it have midstream and even [[Upstream|upstream]] production. This integrated approach to oil production allows companies like Exxon ([XOM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=xom)), Shell ([RDS.A](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=rds-a)) and Chevron ([CVX](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=cvx)) to take oil from exploration all the way to sale. The refining side of the business is actually hurt by high prices, because demand for many [[Petroleum|petroleum]] products, including gas, is price sensitive. However, when oil prices drop, selling value-added products becomes more profitable. Refining pure plays include Marathon Petroleum Corporation ([MPC](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=mpc)), CVR Energy Inc. ([CVI](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=cvi)) and Valero Energy Corp ([VLO](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=vlo)).

One area service companies and refiners agree on is creating more pipeline capacity and transport. Refiners want more pipeline to keep down the cost of transporting oil by truck or rail. Service companies want more pipeline because they make money in the design and laying stages, and get a steady income from maintenance and testing.

## Oil Refinery Safety

Oil refineries can be dangerous places to work at times. For example, in 2005 there was an accident at BP's Texas City oil refinery. According to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, a series of explosions occurred during the restarting of a hydrocarbon isomerization unit. Fifteen workers were killed and 180 others were injured. The explosions occurred when a distillation tower flooded with hydrocarbons and was over-pressurized, causing a geyser-like release from the vent stack.2
