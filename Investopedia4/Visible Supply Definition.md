[[Visible Supply Definition]]
## What Is Visible [[Supply]]?

Visible [[Supply|supply]] is the amount of a good or [[commodity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp) that is currently being stored or transported that is available to be bought or sold. This supply is important as it identifies a definite quantity of goods available for purchase or delivery upon the assignment of [[futures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp) contracts. For instance, all of the wheat held in granaries or storage facilities, along with the wheat being transported from farms constitutes part of the visible supply.

In the [[municipal bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp) markets, the 30 day visible [[Supply|supply]] refers to the total [[par value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) (face value) of all [[new issue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/newissue.asp) municipal bonds that are expected to be coming to market in the next 30 days.1

### Key Takeaways

-   The visible [[Supply|supply]] refers to the quantity of some good or asset that is available for sale, or is en route to be available.
-   In securities markets, such as for muni bonds, the visible [[Supply|supply]] refers to the total volume in dollars of municipal bonds with maturities of 13 months or more that are expected to reach the market over the next 30 days.2
-   The visible [[Supply|supply]] gives an indication of the supply side of the market.

## Understanding Visible [[Supply]]

Prices in the market are said to be determined by the law of [[supply and demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-[[Supply|supply]]-demand.asp) - the more supply of some good available affects the demand (and vice versa). Therefore, being able to account for the supply of commodities is of crucial importance to these markets and their related [[Futures|futures]] markets. In general, an increase in visible supply is considered to be a bearish signal, while a decrease is considered a bullish one.

However, the price of a good is not completely influenced by the amount of visible [[Supply|supply]]. Because commodities, such as wheat or oil, are often purchased through [[Futures|futures]], [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp), or [[forward]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp) contracts long before the date of actual physical delivery, prices are more likely to be influenced by the future supply rather than what is available at that moment. Future supply, or supply which is currently in processing or preparation, is said to be part of the invisible supply, since it cannot (yet) be counted and accounted for.

## Visible vs. Invisible [[Supply]]

Visible [[Supply|supply]] stands in contrast to [[invisible supply]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblesupply.asp), which refers to an unknown or unquantifiable amount of physical [[Stock|stock]] of a commodity that [[Will|will]] eventually be available for delivery upon settlement of a [[Futures|futures]] contract.

Unlike the visible [[Supply|supply]], this amount of supply [[Underlying|underlying]] a [[Futures|futures]] contract exists, but it hasn't yet been accumulated, stored, or set aside for delivery; whereas any such [[Stock|stock]] of a commodity that has been accounted for is the "visible" supply.

## 30 Day Visible [[Supply]] in Municipal Bond Markets

In municipal bond markets, the 30 day visible [[Supply|supply]] is used to estimate the health of the market for new issues. It is an indication of how much new [[Debt|debt]] is expected to come to market. The 30 day visible supply is published in [[The Daily Bond Buyer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondbuyer.asp), a trade publication for members of the municipal bond industry that began as a daily newspaper over 100 years ago, and now provides sophisticated real-time market data via a subscription-based digital version.3

An increase in the visible [[Supply|supply]] of bonds is bearish for prices as more bonds [[Will|will]] increase the supply of new [[Debt|debt]]. Likewise, a fall in the 30 day visible supply is bullish for bond prices.
