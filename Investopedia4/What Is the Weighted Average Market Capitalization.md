[[What Is the Weighted Average Market Capitalization]]?
## [[What Is the Weighted Average Market Capitalization]]?

The [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] refers to a type of [[Stock|stock]] [[Market Index|market index]] construction that is based on the [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of the index's constituent [[Stocks|stocks]]. Large companies would, therefore, account for a greater portion of an index than smaller stocks. This means the movement of an index would depend on a small set of stocks.

The most well-known [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] weight index is the S&P 500, which tracks the 500 largest assets by market capitalization. The top four [[Holdings|holdings]] combine for over 10% of the entire index. These include Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=msft)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn)), and Facebook ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=fb)).1 The S&P 500 is widely considered a gauge of the health of the broader market and a benchmark for performance. 

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Weighted]] average [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] is a type of [[Market Index|market index]] in which each component is weighted according to the size of its total market capitalization.
-   [[Market Capitalization|Market capitalization]] is the sum of the total value of a company's outstanding [[Shares|shares]] multiplied by the price of one share.
-   With a [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]], components that have a higher market cap have more influence because they constitute a higher percentage in the index; those with smaller caps have less influence.
-   A [[Weighted|weighted]] market cap index is seen as being both stable, and reflective of the broader market, in which larger companies have a greater influence than smaller ones.
-   On the downside, a [[Weighted|weighted]] market cap index can hurt index investors if there is a [[Rally|rally]] in small-cap [[Stocks|stocks]], as those investors won't benefit as much as they would in an equal-weighted index.

## Understanding the [[Weighted]] Average [[Market Capitalization]]

The [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] is determined by multiplying the current market price by the number of outstanding [[Shares|shares]] and then taking an average to determine the weighting. For example, if a company's market capitalization is $1 million, and the market capitalization of all [[Stocks|stocks]] in the index is $100 million, the company would represent 1% of the index. Morningstar calculates the metric by taking a geometric mean of the market capitalization of the stocks in a fund, whereas other providers use an arithmetic mean.2 

Some investors believe a [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] is the optimal method of asset allocation as it reflects the actual behavior of markets. This way larger companies tend to have a greater influence over the index, just as is the case in the S&P 500. This leads to a natural [[Rebalancing|rebalancing]] mechanism where growing companies are admitted to the index, and shrinking ones become excluded. Investors also believe the methodology causes less [[Risk|risk]] because a larger proportion of the fund is allocated to stable companies.

But there are some limitations to the strategy. When small-cap [[Stocks|stocks]] [[Outperform|outperform]] larger ones, as they have for most of history, there are fewer opportunities for index investors to [[Gain|gain]] lofty returns. Meanwhile, market-cap-[[Weighted|weighted]] indexes like the S&P 500 give off the appearance of [[Diversification|diversification]], but a few stocks dictate a larger portion of the movement. This represents a big bet that the [efficient market hypothesis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp) holds through bull and bear markets. 

The efficient market hypothesis says that [[Stock|stock]] prices reflect all information available, and trade at fair market value on all exchanges.

## Alternatives to [[Weighted]] Average [[Market Capitalization]]

Alternative methods of asset allocation include price weighting and equal market cap weighting among many more. The [[Holdings|holdings]] of a price-[[Weighted|weighted]] index are determined by a simple mathematical average of several [[Stock|stock]] prices. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp) is perhaps the most well-known index that employs price weighting.3

In contrast, an equal-[[Weighted|weighted]] index gives the same weight to each [[Stock|stock]] in a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] or fund. For example, the [[S&P 500 Equal Weight Index]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/market-equal-weight.asp) is the equal-weighted version of the popular market-cap-weighted S&P 500.4
