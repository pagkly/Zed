[[Flat Yield Curve]]
## What Is the [[Flat Yield Curve]]?

The [[Flat Yield Curve|flat yield curve]] is a [[yield curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldcurve.asp) in which there is little difference between short-term and long-term rates for bonds of the same credit quality. This type of [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] flattening is often seen during transitions between normal and inverted curves. The difference between a flat [[Yield|yield]] curve and a [[Normal Yield Curve|normal yield curve]] is that a normal yield curve slopes upward.

## Understanding the [[Flat Yield Curve]]

When short and long-term bonds [[Offer|offer]] equivalent yields, there is usually little benefit in holding the longer-term instrument; the investor does not [[Gain|gain]] any excess compensation for the risks associated with holding longer-term securities. If the [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] is flattening, it indicates the [[Yield|yield]] spread between long-term and short-term bonds is decreasing. For example, a [[Flat Yield Curve|flat yield curve]] on [[U.S. Treasury]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp) bonds is one in which the yield on a two-year bond is 5% and the yield on a 30-year bond is 5.1%.

A flattening [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] may be a result of long-term interest rates falling more than short-term interest rates or short-term rates increasing more than long-term rates. A [[Flat Yield Curve|flat yield curve]] is typically an indication that investors and traders are worried about the macroeconomic outlook. One reason the [[Yield|yield]] curve may flatten is market participants may be expecting inflation to decrease or the Federal Reserve to raise the federal funds rate in the near term.

For example, if the Federal Reserve increases its short-term target over a specified period, long-term interest rates may remain stable or rise. However, short-term interest rates would rise. Consequently, the slope of the [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] would flatten as short-term rates increase more than long-term rates.

### Key Takeaways

-   A flattening [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] is when short-term and long-terms bonds see no discernible change in rates. This makes long-term bonds less attractive to investors.
-   Such a curve can be considered a psychological marker, one that could mean investors are losing faith in a long-term market's growth potential.
-   One way to combat a flattening [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] is to use what's called a Barbell strategy, balancing a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] between long-term and short-term bonds. This strategy works best when the bonds are "laddered," or staggered at certain intervals.

## Special Consideration: The Barbell Strategy

The [[barbell strategy]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/013114/barbell-investment-strategy.asp) may benefit investors in a flattening [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] environment or if the Federal Reserve is looking to raise the federal funds rate. However, the barbell strategy may [[Underperform|underperform]] when the [[Yield|yield]] curve steepens. The barbell strategy is an investment strategy that could be used in fixed-income investing and trading. In a barbell strategy, half of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is comprised of long-term bonds, while the rest is comprised of short-term bonds.

For example, assume the [[Yield|yield]] spread is 8%, and an investor believes the [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] [[Will|will]] flatten. The investor could allocate half of the fixed-income [[Portfolio|portfolio]] to U.S. Treasury 10-year notes and the other half to U.S. Treasury two-year notes. Therefore, the investor has some flexibility and could react to changes in the bond markets. However, the portfolio may experience a significant fall if there is a meteoric increase in long-term rates, which is due to the duration of long-term bonds.
