[[The Ins and Outs of Severance Pay]]
## What Is Severance Pay?

Severance pay is the compensation and/or benefits an employer provides to an employee after employment is over. [[Severance packages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/severence-package.asp) may include extended benefits, such as health insurance and [[outplacement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outplacement.asp) assistance to help an employee secure a new position.

Employers [[Offer|offer]] packages to employees who are laid off, whose jobs are eliminated because of downsizing, or who retire. Some employees who resign or are fired may also receive a severance package.

Severance pay can be a goodwill gesture on the part of the employer and can provide the employee with a buffer between working and [[Unemployment|unemployment]].

### Key Takeaways

-   Severance pay is any form of compensation paid by an employer to an employee after employment has ended.
-   Unless a contract or employee handbook requires it, employers are not legally required to pay severance.
-   Severance may include accrued vacation and extended benefits, such as health insurance and outplacement assistance to help an employee find another job.

## Understanding Severance Pay

[Severance pay](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/052214/seven-considerations-when-you-negotiate-severance.asp) is offered to employees in certain circumstances after their employment ends. The amount an employee receives often depends on how long they were with the employer. Most employers have policies in their employee handbook that outline how they handle severance pay.

Packages offered by employers usually come in a lump sum and are taxable. They generally include an employee's regular pay along with some or all of the following:

-   Extra pay based on months or years of employment
-   Compensation for unused, accrued vacation time, sick days, and/or holiday pay
-   Medical and dental benefits, and life insurance
-   Retirement accounts and [[Stock|stock]] options

## Do Businesses Have to [[Offer]] Severance Pay?

According to the [[U.S. Department of Labor]](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/severancepay), there is no law that requires employers to provide severance pay.1 However, if an employee's contract stipulates that they receives severance pay upon dismissal or if the employee handbook promises severance pay, the company is legally obligated to follow through with those pledges. Additionally, if the company makes a verbal promise to provide an employee with severance pay, it must uphold that agreement.

Regardless of whether a company offers severance pay, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fair-labor-standards-act-flsa.asp) mandates an employer must pay terminated employees through their last day of work, and the employer must also pay any accrued vacation time to employees.2

## Why [[Offer]] Severance Pay?

As noted, businesses are not required to pay severance, although most [[Offer|offer]] packages on a case-by-case basis and as dictated by employment contracts.

When businesses fail to [[Offer|offer]] severance packages, it can upset staff and create negative public relations. In 2018, Sears announced it planned to lay off hourly employees without giving them any severance pay. The company, which was restructuring in bankruptcy, also said it planned to pay its executives millions in annual bonuses, which drew significant criticism from employees and the general public.3

## Severance and [[Unemployment]] Benefits

Severance pay can affect [[unemployment compensation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Unemployment|unemployment]]-compensation.asp) in two ways. If the employer pays the employee severance fee in a lump sum, the employee can apply for [[unemployment insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-insurance.asp) right away as they are no longer on the company's [[Payroll|payroll]].4

However, in some cases, companies issue severance pay over a period of several months. Through that process, the employee is still technically on the [[Payroll|payroll]], even if they do not go to work. This means they cannot apply for [[Unemployment|unemployment]]. Similarly, if an employee has unused vacation time, they are on the payroll as they use it.4

The laws concerning [[Unemployment|unemployment]] and severance pay vary by state, so it's important to check with your local employment office about when to apply for unemployment benefits.

In other cases, severance pay affects [[Unemployment Compensation|unemployment compensation]] because of the contracts many people sign when they accept severance pay. In exchange for [[Offering|offering]] severance packages, some companies make their employees sign statements saying they voluntarily resigned from their posts. These agreements prohibit the employee from claiming [[Unemployment Insurance|unemployment insurance]], which is reserved for people who are dismissed from their jobs involuntarily. It is wise to read any documents carefully before signing them; legal advice may also be in order as it is [[sometimes possible to improve the initial severance package]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/052214/seven-considerations-when-you-negotiate-severance.asp) that was offered.
