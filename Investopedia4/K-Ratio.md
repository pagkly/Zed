[[K-Ratio]]
## What Is the [[K-Ratio]]?

The [[K-Ratio|K-ratio]] is a valuation metric that examines the consistency of an [[Equity|equity]]'s [[Return|return]] over time. The data for the ratio is derived from a [[value-added monthly index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vami.asp) (VAMI), which uses [[linear regression]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regression.asp) to track the progress of a $1,000 initial investment in the [[Security|security]] being analyzed.

### Key Takeaways

-   K-ratios measure an [[Equity|equity]]’s consistency of returns over time, calculated using the value-added monthly index (VAMI).
-   The calculation involves running a linear regression on the logarithmic cumulative [[Return|return]] of a Value-Added Monthly Index (VAMI) curve.
-   The [[K-Ratio|K-ratio]] takes into account the returns themselves, but also the order of those returns in measuring [[Risk|risk]].
-   The ratio measures the [[Return|return]] of the [[Security|security]] over time and is a good tool to measure the performance of equities because it takes the return trend into account.

## Formula and Calculation of the [[K-Ratio]]

The [[K-Ratio|K-ratio]] can be calculated as:

## What the [[K-Ratio]] Can Tell You

The [[K-Ratio|K-ratio]] was developed by derivatives trader and statistician Lars Kestner as a way to address a perceived gap in how returns had been analyzed. Because an investor’s key interests are returns and consistency, Kestner designed his K-ratio to measure [[Risk|risk]] versus [[Return|return]] by analyzing how steady a [[Security|security]], [[Portfolio|portfolio]], or manager’s returns are over time. 

The [[K-Ratio|K-ratio]] takes into account the returns, but also the order of those returns in measuring [[Risk|risk]]. The calculation involves running a linear regression on the logarithmic cumulative [[Return|return]] of a Value-Added Monthly Index (VAMI) curve. The results of the regression are then used in the K-ratio formula. The slope is the return, which should be positive, while the standard error of the slope represents the risk.

In 2003, Kestner introduced a modified version of his original [[K-Ratio|K-ratio]], which changed the formula of the calculation to include the number of [[Return|return]] data points in the denominator. He introduced a further modification, which added a square root calculation to the numerator, in 2013.1

## Example of How to Use the [[K-Ratio]]

The ratio measures the [[Return|return]] of the [[Security|security]] over time and it is considered to be a good tool to measure the performance of equities because it takes the return trend into account, versus point-in-time snapshots.

The [[K-Ratio|K-ratio]] allows for a comparison of cumulative returns for different equities (and [[Equity|equity]] managers) returns over time. It differs from the widely used [[Sharpe]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) measure by taking into account the order in which returns occur. In practice, the K-ratio is designed to be viewed in tandem with and in addition to other measures of performance.

In addition to their use in analyzing individual [[Stock|stock]] returns, style categories, and fund managers, K-ratios can also be calculated for bonds. K-ratios [[Will|will]] differ across asset classes (domestic [[Stocks|stocks]] versus bonds versus emerging market stocks), within asset classes (e.g., large-cap versus small-cap) and by time period.
