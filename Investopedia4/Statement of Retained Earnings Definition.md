## [[Retained Earnings]]

These funds may also be referred to as retained profit, accumulated earnings, or accumulated [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]]. Often, these retained funds are used to make a payment on any [[Debt|debt]] obligations or are reinvested into the company to promote growth and development.

Whenever a company generates [[Surplus|surplus]] income, a portion of the long-term shareholders may expect some regular income in the form of dividends as a reward for putting their money in the company. Traders who look for short-term gains may also prefer getting dividend payments that [[Offer|offer]] instant gains. Dividends are paid out from profits, and so reduce [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] for the company.

### Important

[[Retained Earnings|Retained earnings]] refer to any profits made by an organization that it keeps for internal use.

## Benefits of a Statement of [[Retained Earnings]]

The purpose of releasing a statement of [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] is to improve market and investor confidence in the organization. It is used as a marker to help analyze the health of a firm. Retained earnings do not represent [[Surplus|surplus]] funds. Instead, the retained earnings are redirected, often as a [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] within the organization.

The [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] for a [[capital-intensive]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalintensive.asp) industry or a company in a growth period [[Will|will]] generally be higher than some less-intensive or stable companies. This is due to the larger amount being redirected toward asset development. For example, a technology-based business may have higher asset development needs than a simple t-shirt manufacturer, as a result of the differences in the emphasis on new product development.

While a t-shirt can remain essentially [[Unchanged|unchanged]] for a long period of time, a computer or smartphone requires more regular advancement to stay competitive within the market. Hence, the technology company [[Will|will]] likely have higher [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] than the t-shirt manufacturer.

## The [[Retention Ratio]]

One piece of financial data that can be gleaned from the statement of [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] is the [[Retention Ratio|retention ratio]]. The retention ratio (or [[Plowback Ratio|plowback ratio]]) is the proportion of earnings kept back in the business as retained earnings. The retention ratio refers to the percentage of net income that is retained to grow the business, rather than being paid out as dividends. It is the opposite of the [payout ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payoutratio.asp), which measures the percentage of profit paid out to shareholders as dividends.

The [[Retention Ratio|retention ratio]] helps investors determine how much money a company is keeping to reinvest in the company's operation. If a company pays all of its [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] out as dividends or does not reinvest back into the business, earnings growth might suffer. Also, a company that is not using its retained earnings effectively have an increased likelihood of taking on additional [[Debt|debt]] or issuing new [[Equity|equity]] [[Shares|shares]] to [[Finance|finance]] growth.

As a result, the [[Retention Ratio|retention ratio]] helps investors determine a company's [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] rate. However, companies that hoard too much profit might not be using their cash effectively and might be better off had the money been invested in new equipment, technology, or expanding product lines. New companies typically don't pay dividends since they're still growing and need the capital to [[Finance|finance]] growth. However, established companies usually pay a portion of their [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] out as dividends while also reinvesting a portion back into the company.
