[[What Is Over-Collateralization (OC)]]?
## What Is Over-Collateralization?

Over-collateralization (OC) is the provision of [[Collateral|collateral]] that is worth more than enough to cover potential losses in cases of [[Default|default]].

For example, a business owner seeking a [[Loan|loan]] could [[Offer|offer]] property or equipment worth 10% or 20% more than the amount being borrowed. Over-collateralization may be used by companies issuing bonds for the same reason.

### Key Takeaways

-   A borrower may use over-collateralization in order to get better terms for a [[Loan|loan]],
-   An issuer of asset-backed securities may use over-collateralization to reduce the [[Risk|risk]] to potential investors.
-   In either case, over-collateralization may enhance the credit [[Rating|rating]] of the borrower or the issuer of [[Debt|debt]].

In the financial services industry, over-collateralization is used to offset the [[Risk|risk]] in products such as mortgage-backed securities. In this case, additional assets are added to the [[Security|security]] to cushion any capital losses due to defaults on the individual loans that are packaged in the security.

In any case, the purpose of over-collateralization is to increase the credit [[Rating|rating]] or the credit profile of the borrower or the issuer of securities by reducing the [[Risk|risk]] to the investor.

## Understanding Over-CollateralizationÂ (OC)

[Securitization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitization.asp) is the practice of transforming a collection of assets, such as loans, into an investment, or [[Security|security]]. Ordinary bank loans such as home mortgages are sold on by the banks that issue them to financial institutions that then package them for resale as securitized investments.

In any case, these are not liquid assets but interest-producing debts. In financial terminology, they are [[asset-backed securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-backedsecurity.asp) (ABS). Almost any kind of [[Debt|debt]] may be securitized include residential or commercial mortgages, student loans, car loans, and credit card debt.

### Credit Enhancement

A key step in the securitization of products is determining the appropriate level of [[credit enhancement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditenhancement.asp). This refers to [[Risk|risk]] reduction to improve the credit profile of the structured financial products. A higher credit profile leads to a higher credit [[Rating|rating]], which is key to finding buyers for securitized assets.

Investors in any securitized product face a [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]] on the [[Underlying|underlying]] assets. Credit enhancement can be thought of as a financial cushion that allows the securities to absorb losses from defaults on the underlying loans.

### 10% to 20%

The [[Rule Of Thumb|rule of thumb]] for the amount of over-collateralization needed in order to improve a credit profile.

Over-collateralization is one technique that may be used for credit enhancement. In this case, the issuer backs a [[Loan|loan]] with assets or [[Collateral|collateral]] which has a value that is in excess of the loan. That limits the [[credit risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) for the [[Creditor|creditor]] and enhances the credit [[Rating|rating]] assigned to the loan.

### The [[Rule Of Thumb|Rule of Thumb]]

Over-collateralization is achieved when the value of assets in the pool is greater than the amount of the [[asset-backed security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-backedsecurity.asp) (ABS). So, even if some of the payments from the [[Underlying|underlying]] loans are late or go into [[Default|default]], the [[Principal|principal]] and interest payments on the asset-backed [[Security|security]] can still be made from the excess [[Collateral|collateral]].

As a [[Rule Of Thumb|rule of thumb]], the value [[Underlying|underlying]] a pool of assets is often 10% to 20% greater than the price of the issued [[Security|security]]. For example, the [[Principal|principal]] amount of a mortgage-backed security issue might be $100 million, while the principal value of the mortgages underlying the issue might be $120 million.

### A Cautionary Note

It should be noted that many asset-backed securities were supposedly over-collateralized at the time of the 2008 [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]]. In fact, the value of the assets used as [[Collateral|collateral]] was much lower than presented, or the risks that the borrowers would [[Default|default]] was much higher than expected, or both. That led directly to the sub-prime crisis that ensued in 2008.
