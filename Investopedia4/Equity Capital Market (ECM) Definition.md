[[Equity Capital Market (ECM) Definition]]
## What is an [[Equity]] Capital Market (ECM)?

The [[Equity|equity]] capital market (ECM) is where financial institutions help companies raise equity capital and where [[Stocks|stocks]] are traded. It consists of the [[primary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarymarket.asp) for private placements, initial public offerings (IPOs) and warrants; and the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp), where existing [[Shares|shares]] are sold, and [[Futures|futures]], options and swaps are traded.

## Understanding [[Equity]] [[Capital Markets What You Should Know|Capital Markets]]

The [[Equity|equity]] capital market (ECM) is broader than the [[Stock|stock]] market because it covers a wider range of financial instruments and activities. These include the marketing and distribution and allocation of issues, [[IPOs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp), private placements, derivatives trading, and [[book building]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookbuilding.asp). The main participants in the ECM are investment banks, broker-dealers, retail investors, venture capitalists, private equity firms, angel investors and securities firms.

Together with the [[bond market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp), the ECM channels money provided by savers and depository institutions to investors. As part of the [[Capital Markets What You Should Know|capital markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp), the ECM, leads, in theory, to the efficient allocation of resources within a market economy.

## Primary [[Equity Market]]

The primary [[Equity Market|equity market]], where companies issue new securities, is divided into a private placement market, and a primary public market. In the private placement market, companies raise private [[Equity|equity]] through unquoted [[Shares|shares]] that are sold to investors directly. In the primary public market, private companies can [[go public]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goingpublic.asp) through IPOs, and [[Listed|listed]] companies can issue new equity through [[seasoned issues]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonedissue.asp).

## Secondary [[Equity Market]]

The secondary market, where no new capital is created, is what most people typically think of as the "[stock market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp)”. It is where existing [[Shares|shares]] are bought and sold, and consists of [[Stock|stock]] exchanges and [[over-the-counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) markets, where a network of dealers trade [[Stocks|stocks]] without an exchange acting as an intermediary.

## Advantages/Disadvantages of Raising Capital in [[Equity]] Markets

Raising capital through [[Equity|equity]] markets offers several advantages for companies.

The first one is a lower [[debt to equity ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp). Companies [[Will|will]] not need to access [[Debt|debt]] markets with expensive interest rates to [[Finance|finance]] future growth. [[Equity]] markets are also relatively more flexible and have a greater variety of financing options for growth as compared to debt markets. In some instances, especially in private placement, equity markets also help [[Entrepreneurs|entrepreneurs]] and company founders bring in experience and oversight from senior colleagues. This will help companies expand their business to new markets and products or provide needed counsel.

But there are also problems with raising capital in [[Equity|equity]] markets. For example, the route to a public [[Offering|offering]] can be an expensive and time-consuming one. Numerous actors are involved in the process, resulting in a multiplication of costs and time required to bring a company to market.

Added to this is the constant scrutiny. While [[Equity Market|equity market]] investors are more tolerant of [[Risk|risk]] as compared to their [[Debt|debt]] market counterparts, they are also focused on returns. As such, investors impatient with a company that has consistently produced negative returns may abandon it, leading to a sharp drop in its valuation.
