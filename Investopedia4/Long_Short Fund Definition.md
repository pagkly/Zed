Long/Short Fund Definition
## What Is a Long/Short Fund?

A long/short fund is a type of mutual fund or [[hedge fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) that takes both long and short positions in investments typically from a specific [[Market Segment|market segment]]. These funds often use several alternative investing techniques such as [[Leverage|leverage]], derivatives and short positions to purchases relatively undervalued securities and sell overvalued ones.

Long/short funds may also be referred to as enhanced funds or [130/30 funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/130-30_strategy.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   Long/short funds use an investment strategy that seeks to take a long position in underpriced [[Stocks|stocks]] while selling short overpriced [[Shares|shares]].
-   Long/short seeks to augment traditional long-only investing by taking advantage of profit opportunities from securities identified as both under-valued and over-valued.
-   Long/short [[Equity|equity]] is commonly used by [[Hedge|hedge]] funds, which often take a relative long bias—for instance, a 130/30 strategy where long exposure is 130% of AUM and 30% is short exposure.

## The Basics of a Long/Short Fund

Long/short funds typically seek to enhance the returns from investing in a specific [[Market Segment|market segment]] by actively taking both long and short positions in securities. Long/short funds use varying active management techniques to determine [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Holdings|holdings]]. They may also use [[Leverage|leverage]], derivatives and short positions which can increase the risks of the fund as well as the fund’s potential total [[Return|return]].

Long/short funds represent some similarities to [[Hedge|hedge]] funds. They seek to [[Offer|offer]] investment strategies with greater [[Risk|risk]] and greater [[Return|return]] potential over standard benchmarks. Most long/short funds feature higher [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) than hedge funds, no lock-in periods and lower fees. However, they still have higher fees and less liquidity than most mutual funds. Long/short funds also may require higher [[minimum investments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_investment.asp) than other mutual funds. Long/short funds are more closely regulated than hedge funds therefore they have limitations on the use of [[Leverage|leverage]] and derivatives where hedge funds do not.

Long/short funds can be a good investment for investors seeking targeted index exposure with some active management. Long/short funds also [[Offer|offer]] the advantage of hedging against changing market environments and other trends that active management can account for.

## Understanding the 130-30 Strategy

The most common long/short strategy is to be long 130% and short 30% (130 - 30 = 100%) of assets under management.To engage in a 130-30 strategy, an [investment manager](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp) might rank the [[Stocks|stocks]] used in the S&P 500 from best to worse on expected [[Return|return]], as signaled by past performance. A manager [[Will|will]] use a number of data sources and rules for ranking individual stocks. Typically stocks are ranked according to a selection criteria (for example, total returns, [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted performance or relative strength) over a designated look-back period of six months or one year. The stocks are then ranked best to worst.

From the best ranking [[Stocks|stocks]], the manager would invest 100% of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s value and short sell the bottom ranking stocks, up to 30% of the portfolio's value. The cash earned from the [short sales](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp) would be reinvested into top-ranking stocks, allowing for greater exposure to the higher ranking stocks.
