[[Collection Agency]]
## What Is a [[Collection Agency]]?

A [[Collection Agency|collection agency]] is a company used by [[lenders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) or [[creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) to recover funds that are [[Past Due|past due]], or from accounts that are in [[Default|default]]. Often, a creditor [[Will|will]] hire a collection agency after it has made multiple failed attempts to collect its receivables. A lender may outsource the [[Debt|debt]]-collection activity to a [[Third Party|third party]] (the collection agency), or it may have an internal department or a debt-collection subsidiary that would handle the job.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Collection Agency|collection agency]] is a company that lenders use to recover funds that are [[Past Due|past due]] or from accounts that are in [[Default|default]].
-   Collection agencies work closely with the credit bureaus and lenders to try to retrieve delinquent funds.
-   Collection agencies are regulated by the [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)]] and bound by rules about what they can and cannot do to collect funds.

## How a [[Collection Agency]] Works

When a [[borrower]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distressedborrower.asp) defaults on their debts or fails to make scheduled [[Loan|loan]] payments, the [[Creditor|creditor]] [[Will|will]] report this delinquency to a [[credit bureau]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditbureau.asp). Then, not only will the borrower's credit history be tarnished, but also their [[Debt|debt]] will be turned over to a [[Collection Agency|collection agency]] within three-to-six months of [[Default|default]].

### When a Borrower Pays

If the borrower pays their [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp) as a result of the [[Collection Agency|collection agency]]'s efforts, then the [[Creditor|creditor]] pays the collection agency a percentage of the funds, or assets, that it recovers. Depending on the original agreement entered into with the creditor, the [[Debtor|debtor]] may have to pay the full debt all at once or a portion of it at a time.

### When a Borrower Does Not Pay

If the borrower still [[Will|will]] not, or cannot cover their [[arrearage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arrearage.asp), the [[Collection Agency|collection agency]] can update the borrower’s credit report with a "collection" status, which leads to a drop in the individual’s [[credit score]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp). A low [[Credit Score|credit score]] can affect a person's chances of obtaining a [[Loan|loan]] in the [[Long Term|long term]], as an account under [[Debt|debt]] collection can remain on their credit report for seven years.

Collection agencies deploy multiple strategies to try to retrieve funds, such as the following:

-   Calling the [[Debtor|debtor]]’s personal and office telephones
-   Mailing numerous late-payment notices to the [[Debtor|debtor]]
-   Contacting a [[Debtor|debtor]]’s family, friends, and neighbors to confirm the debtor’s contact information
-   Appearing at the individual’s front door

## [[Debt]] [[Collection Agency]] Regulations

Third-party collection agencies—but not creditors' in-house collection departments—are bound by the [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fair-[[Debt|debt]]-collection-practices-act-fdcpa.asp) (FDCPA), of which some rules are cited below.

A [[Debt|debt]] collector may not do the following:

-   Proceed to collect an old [[Debt|debt]] that has been charged off as "uncollectible"—the [[Debtor|debtor]] has either filed for bankruptcy or cannot be located
-   Sue or threaten to sue a borrower because of their [[Debt|debt]]
-   Legally seize assets from a [[Debtor|debtor]]—unless the [[Collection Agency|collection agency]] has won a lawsuit against a debtor
-   Physically harm or threaten to harm a [[Debtor|debtor]] in an attempt to extract a payment
-   Contact an individual at work if they have explicitly stated that their employer does not approve of such calls

A [[Debt|debt]] collector may, however, do the following:

-   Attempt to collect a [[Debt|debt]] on which the [[Statute of Limitations|statute of limitations]]—usually between four and six years from the first day of [[Default|default]]—has run out
-   Call an individual between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. only
-   Contact the [[Debtor|debtor]]’s employer about overdue child support and alimony, federal [[student loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/student-[[Debt|debt]].asp), or taxes
