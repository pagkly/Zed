[[Lessor]]
## What is a [[Lessor]]?

A [[Lessor|lessor]] is essentially someone who grants a [[Lease|lease]] to someone else. As such, a lessor is the owner of an asset that is leased under an agreement to a [[Lessee|lessee]]. The [[lessee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lessee.asp) makes a one-time payment or a series of periodic payments to the lessor in [[Return|return]] for the use of the asset.

### key takeaways

-   A [[Lessor|lessor]] is the owner of an asset that is leased, or rented, to another party, known as the [[Lessee|lessee]].
-   Lessors and lessees enter into a binding contract, known as the [[Lease|lease]] agreement, that spells out the terms of their arrangement.
-   While any sort of property can be leased, the practice is most commonly associated with residential or commercial real [[Estate|estate]]—a home or office.

## Understanding Lessors

A [[Lessor|lessor]] can be either an individual or a legal entity. The [[lease]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lease|lease]].asp) agreement that they enter into with another party is binding on both the lessor and the [[Lessee|lessee]] and spells out the rights and obligations of both parties. In addition to the use of the property, the lessor may [[Grant|grant]] special privileges to the lessee, such as early termination of the lease or renewal on [[Unchanged|unchanged]] terms, solely at their discretion.

For a [[Lessor|lessor]], the main advantage of entering into a [[Lease|lease]] agreement is that they retain the ownership of the property while generating a [[Return|return]] on their invested capital. For the [[Lessee|lessee]], periodic payments may be easier to [[Finance|finance]] than the full [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of the property.

## Types of Leases and Lessors

In the public's mind, leases are usually associated with real [[Estate|estate]]—a rented residence or office. But actually, almost any sort of asset can be leased. It can either be tangible property such as a home, office, car or computer, or intangible property like a [[trademark]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trademark.asp) or brand name. The [[Lessor|lessor]] in each instance is the owner of the asset.

For example, in the case of real [[Estate|estate]] or a car, the [[Lessor|lessor]] is the property owner or automobile dealer respectively; in the case of a trademark or brand name, the lessor is the company that owns it and has conferred the right to use the trademark or brand name to a [[franchisee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/franchisee.asp). When used in connection with the motor carrier industry, lessor refers to the owner of a commercial motor vehicle who contracts with the entity that holds operating authority for the use of the vehicle.

Some lessors can also [[Grant|grant]] a "rent-to-own" [[Lease|lease]] whereby some or all of the payments made by the [[Lessee|lessee]] [[Will|will]] eventually be converted from lease payments to a down payment on the eventual purchase of the leased item. This type of arrangement usually occurs in a commercial context—when leasing large industrial equipment, for example. But it is also common in a consumer context with [[automobiles]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/082315/renttoown-car-how-it-works.asp), and even with [[residential real estate.]](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/rent-to-own-homes/)

The [[Lessor|lessor]] is also known as the landlord in [[Lease|lease]] agreements that deal with property or real [[Estate|estate]].

## Special Consideration for Lessors

The most common type of [[Lease|lease]] is for homes or apartments in which individuals and families live. Because housing is an important matter of public policy, many jurisdictions have created governing bodies that regulate and oversee the legal relationships and acceptable terms of leases between lessors and lessees in this field. For example, in the state of New York, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) is responsible for administering rent regulation in the state, including New York City.1 This responsibility includes both rent control and rent stabilization.
