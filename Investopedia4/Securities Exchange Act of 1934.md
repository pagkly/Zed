The SEA authorized the formation of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp), the regulatory arm of the SEA. The SEC has the power to oversee securities—[[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, and [[over-the-counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) securities—as well as markets and the conduct of financial professionals, including brokers, dealers, and investment advisors.

All companies [[Listed|listed]] on [[Stock|stock]] exchanges must follow the requirements outlined in the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]. Primary requirements include registration of any securities listed on stock exchanges, disclosure, [[proxy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxy.asp) solicitations, and [[margin]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) and audit requirements.

The SEC can choose to file a case in federal court or settle the matter outside of trial.

The SEA of 1934 granted the SEC broad authority to regulate all aspects of the securities industry. It is led by five commissioners, who are appointed by the president, and has five divisions: Division of Corporation [[Finance]], Division of Trading and Markets, Division of Investment Management, [[Division of Enforcement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/division-of-enforcement.asp) and Division of Economic and [[Risk]] Analysis.

The SEC has the power and responsibility to lead investigations into potential violations of the SEA, such as [[insider trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insidertrading.asp), selling unregistered [[Stocks|stocks]], stealing customers' funds, manipulating [[market prices]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp), disclosing false financial information, and breaching broker-customer integrity.

Also, the SEC enforces corporate reporting by all companies with more than $10 million in assets and whose [[Shares|shares]] are held by more than 500 owners.

## History of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]

The SEA of 1934 was enacted by Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration as a response to the widely held belief that irresponsible financial practices were one of the chief causes of the [1929 [[Stock|stock]] market crash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash-1929.asp). The SEA of 1934 followed the [[Securities Act of 1933]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitiesact1933.asp), which required corporations to make public certain financial information, including stock sales and distribution.

Other regulatory measures put forth by the Roosevelt administration include the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Trust Indenture Act of 1934, the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investadvact.asp), and the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentcompanyact.asp). They all came in the wake of a financial environment in which the [[Commerce|commerce]] of securities was subject to little regulation, and controlling interests of corporations were amassed by relatively few investors without public knowledge.
