[[How to Use the Sharpe Ratio to Analyze Portfolio Risk and Return]]
## What Is the Sharpe Ratio?

The Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate [[William F. Sharpe]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/william-f-sharpe.asp) and is used to help [[investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) understand the [[return of an investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) compared to its [[Risk|risk]].1 2 The ratio is the average [[Return|return]] earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) or total risk. Volatility is a measure of the price fluctuations of an asset or [[Portfolio|portfolio]].

Subtracting the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate from the mean [[Return|return]] allows an investor to better isolate the profits associated with risk-taking activities. [[The risk-free rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/risk-free-rate-return.asp) is the return on an investment with zero risk, meaning it's the return investors could expect for taking no risk. The [[Yield|yield]] for a U.S. Treasury bond, for example, could be used as the risk-free rate.

Generally, the greater the value of the Sharpe ratio, the more attractive the [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted [[Return|return]].

## Formula and Calculation of Sharpe Ratio

Sharpe Ratio\=Rp−Rfσpwhere:Rp\=[[Return|return]] of portfolioRf\=[[Risk|risk]]-free rateσp\=standard deviation of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s excess return\\begin{aligned} &\\textit{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{R\_p - R\_f}{\\sigma\_p}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &R\_{p}=\\text{return of portfolio}\\\\ &R\_{f} = \\text{risk-free rate}\\\\ &\\sigma\_p = \\text{[[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the portfolio's excess return}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

The Sharpe ratio is calculated as follows:

1.  Subtract the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate from the [[Return|return]] of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. The risk-free rate could be a U.S. Treasury rate or [[Yield|yield]], such as the one-year or two-year [[Treasury Yield|Treasury yield]].
2.  Divide the result by the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s excess [[Return|return]]. The [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) helps to show how much the portfolio's return deviates from the expected return. The standard deviation also sheds light on the portfolio's [[Volatility|volatility]].

### Key Takeaways

-   The Sharpe ratio adjusts a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s past performance—or expected future performance—for the excess [[Risk|risk]] that was taken by the investor.
-   A high Sharpe ratio is good when compared to similar portfolios or funds with lower returns.
-   The Sharpe ratio has several weaknesses, including an assumption that investment returns are normally distributed.

## What the Sharpe Ratio Can Tell You

The Sharpe ratio has become the most widely used method for calculating the [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted [[Return|return]]. [[Modern Portfolio Theory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) states that adding assets to a diversified [[Portfolio|portfolio]] that has low correlations can decrease portfolio risk without sacrificing return.

Adding [[Diversification|diversification]] should increase the Sharpe ratio compared to similar portfolios with a lower level of diversification. For this to be true, investors must also accept the assumption that [[Risk|risk]] is equal to [[Volatility|volatility]], which is not unreasonable but may be too narrow to be applied to all investments.

The Sharpe ratio can be used to evaluate a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s past performance ([[Ex-Post|ex-post]]) where actual returns are used in the formula. Alternatively, an investor could use expected portfolio performance and the expected [[Risk|risk]]-free rate to calculate an estimated Sharpe ratio ([ex-ante](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exante.asp)).

The Sharpe ratio can also help explain whether a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s [[Excess Returns|excess returns]] are due to smart investment decisions or a result of too much [[Risk|risk]]. Although one portfolio or fund can enjoy higher returns than its peers, it is only a good investment if those higher returns do not come with an excess of additional risk.

The greater a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s Sharpe ratio, the better its [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted-performance. If the analysis results in a negative Sharpe ratio, it either means the risk-free rate is greater than the portfolio’s [[Return|return]], or the portfolio's return is expected to be negative. In either case, a negative Sharpe ratio does not convey any useful meaning.

## Example of How to Use Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe ratio is often used to compare the change in overall [[Risk|risk]]-[[Return|return]] characteristics when a new asset or asset class is added to a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. For example, an investor is considering adding a [[hedge fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) allocation to their existing portfolio that is currently split between [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds and has returned 15% over the last year. The current risk-free rate is 3.5%, and the [[Volatility|volatility]] of the portfolio’s returns was 12%, which makes the Sharpe ratio of 95.8%, or (15% - 3.5%) divided by 12%.

The investor believes that adding the [[Hedge Fund|hedge fund]] to the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Will|will]] lower the expected [[Return|return]] to 11% for the coming year, but also expects the portfolio’s [[Volatility|volatility]] to drop to 7%. They assume that the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate will remain the same over the coming year. Using the same formula, with the estimated future numbers, the investor finds the portfolio has the expected Sharpe ratio of 107%, or (11% - 3.5%) divided by 7%.

Here, the investor has shown that although the [[Hedge Fund|hedge fund]] investment is lowering the absolute [[Return|return]] of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]], it has improved its performance on a [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted basis. If the addition of the new investment lowered the Sharpe ratio, it should not be added to the portfolio. This example assumes that the Sharpe ratio based on past performance can be fairly compared to expected future performance.

## The Difference Between Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio

A variation of the Sharpe ratio is the [[Sortino ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sortinoratio.asp), which removes the effects of upward price movements on [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] to focus on the distribution of returns that are below the target or required [[Return|return]]. The Sortino ratio also replaces the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate with the required return in the numerator of the formula, making the formula the return of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] less the required return, divided by the distribution of returns below the target or required return.

Another variation of the Sharpe ratio is the [[Treynor Ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treynorratio.asp) that uses a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s beta or [[Correlation|correlation]] the portfolio has with the rest of the market. [[Beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) is a measure of an investment's [[Volatility|volatility]] and [[Risk|risk]] as compared to the overall market. The goal of the Treynor ratio is to determine whether an investor is being compensated for taking additional risk above the inherent risk of the market. The Treynor ratio formula is the [[Return|return]] of the portfolio, minus the risk-free rate, divided by the portfolio’s beta.

## Limitations of Using Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe ratio uses the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of returns in the denominator as its proxy of total [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Risk|risk]], which assumes that returns are normally distributed. A [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] of data is like rolling a pair of dice. We know that over many rolls, the most common result from the dice [[Will|will]] be seven, and the least common results will be two and twelve.

However, returns in the [[financial markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060515/what-are-some-examples-financial-markets-and-their-roles.asp) are skewed away from the average because of a large number of surprising drops or spikes in prices. Additionally, the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] assumes that price movements in either direction are equally risky.

The Sharpe ratio can be manipulated by [[Portfolio|portfolio]] managers seeking to boost their apparent [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted returns history. This can be done by lengthening the measurement interval. This [[Will|will]] result in a lower estimate of [[Volatility|volatility]]. For example, the annualized [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of daily returns is generally higher than that of weekly returns which is, in turn, higher than that of monthly returns.

Choosing a period for the analysis with the best potential Sharpe ratio, rather than a [[Neutral|neutral]] look-back period, is another way to cherry-pick the data that [[Will|will]] distort the [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted returns.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Sharpe Ratio?

The Sharpe Ratio is a financial metric often used by investors when assessing the performance of investment management products and professionals. It consists of taking the excess [[Return|return]] of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]], relative to the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate, and dividing it by the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the portfolio’s [[Excess Returns|excess returns]]. Conceptually, what this provides is a measurement of the portfolio’s outperformance per unit of the portfolio’s [[Volatility|volatility]]. All else being equal, portfolios with higher excess returns or lower volatility [[Will|will]] show higher Sharpe Ratios, and vice-versa.

### What is a good Sharpe Ratio?

Sharpe Ratios above 1.00 are generally considered “good”, as this would suggest that the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is [[Offering|offering]] [[Excess Returns|excess returns]] relative to its [[Volatility|volatility]]. Having said that, investors [[Will|will]] often compare the Sharpe Ratio of a portfolio relative to its peers. Therefore, a portfolio with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.00 might be considered inadequate if the competitors in its peer group have an average Sharpe Ratio above 1.00.

### How is the Sharpe Ratio calculated?

To calculate the Sharpe Ratio, investors first subtract the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate from the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s rate of [[Return|return]], often using U.S. Treasury bond yields as a proxy for the risk-free rate of return. Then, they divide the result by the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the portfolio’s excess return. The exact formula for calculating the Sharpe Ratio is as follows:

Sharpe Ratio\=Rp−Rfσpwhere:Rp\=[[Return|return]] of portfolioRf\=[[Risk|risk]]-free rateσp\=standard deviation of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s excess return\\begin{aligned} &\\textit{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{R\_p - R\_f}{\\sigma\_p}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &R\_{p}=\\text{return of portfolio}\\\\ &R\_{f} = \\text{risk-free rate}\\\\ &\\sigma\_p = \\text{[[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the portfolio's excess return}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

Note that, in using the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]], this formula implicitly assumes that the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]’s returns are normally distributed, which may not in fact be the case.
