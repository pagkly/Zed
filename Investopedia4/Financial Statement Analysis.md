[[Financial Statement Analysis]]
## What Is [[Financial Statement Analysis]]?

[[Financial Statement Analysis|Financial statement analysis]] is the process of analyzing a company's [[financial statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) for decision-making purposes. External stakeholders use it to understand the overall health of an organization as well as to evaluate financial performance and business value. Internal constituents use it as a monitoring tool for managing the finances.

#### [[Financial Statement Analysis]]

## Analyzing Financial Statements

The financial statements of a company record important financial data on every aspect of a business’s activities. As such they can be evaluated on the basis of past, current, and projected performance.

In general, financial statements are centered around [[generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) in the U.S. These principles require a company to create and maintain three main financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the [[Cash Flow Statement|cash flow statement]]. Public companies have stricter standards for financial statement reporting. Public companies must follow GAAP standards which requires accrual accounting.1 Private companies have greater flexibility in their financial statement preparation and also have the option to use either accrual or [[Cash Accounting|cash accounting]].2

Several techniques are commonly used as part of [[Financial Statement Analysis|financial statement analysis]]. Three of the most important techniques include [[horizontal analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/horizontalanalysis.asp), [[vertical analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vertical_analysis.asp), and [[ratio analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratioanalysis.asp). Horizontal analysis compares data horizontally, by analyzing values of line items across two or more years. Vertical analysis looks at the vertical affects line items have on other parts of the business and also the business’s proportions. [[Ratio Analysis|Ratio analysis]] uses important ratio metrics to calculate statistical relationships.

## Financial Statements

As mentioned, there are three main financial statements that every company creates and monitors: the balance sheet, income statement, and [[Cash Flow Statement|cash flow statement]]. Companies use these financial statements to manage the operations of their business and also to provide reporting transparency to their stakeholders. All three statements are interconnected and create different views of a company’s activities and performance.

_Balance Sheet_

The balance sheet is a report of a company's financial worth in terms of book value. It is broken into three parts to include a company’s assets, [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liability|liability]].asp), and [shareholders' equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp). Short-term assets such as cash and accounts receivable can tell a lot about a company’s operational efficiency. Liabilities include its expense arrangements and the [[Debt|debt]] capital it is paying off. Shareholder’s [[Equity|equity]] includes details on equity capital investments and [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] from periodic net income. The balance sheet must balance with assets minus liabilities equaling shareholder’s equity. The resulting shareholder’s equity is considered a company’s book value. This value is an important performance metric that increases or decreases with the financial activities of a company.

_Income Statement_

The income statement breaks down the revenue a company earns against the expenses involved in its business to provide a bottom line, net income profit or loss. The income statement is broken into three parts which help to analyze business efficiency at three different points. It begins with revenue and the direct costs associated with revenue to identify [[Gross Profit|gross profit]]. It then moves to [[Operating Profit|operating profit]] which subtracts indirect expenses such as marketing costs, general costs, and depreciation. Finally it ends with net profit which deducts interest and taxes.

Basic analysis of the income statement usually involves the calculation of gross [[Profit Margin|profit margin]], [[Operating Profit|operating profit]] margin, and net profit margin which each divide profit by revenue. Profit margin helps to show where company costs are low or high at different points of the operations.

_Cash Flow Statement_

The [[Cash Flow Statement|cash flow statement]] provides an overview of the company's cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net income is carried over to the [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] statement where it is included as the [[Top Line|top line]] item for operating activities. Like its title, investing activities include cash flows involved with firmwide investments. The financing activities section includes cash flow from both [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] financing. The bottom line shows how much cash a company has available.

_Free [[Cash Flow]] and Other Valuation Statements_

Companies and analysts also use free [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] statements and other valuation statements to analyze the value of a company. Free cash flow statements arrive at a net present value by discounting the free cash flow a company is estimated to generate over time. Private companies may keep a valuation statement as they progress toward potentially [[Going Public|going public]].

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Financial Statement Analysis|Financial statement analysis]] is used by internal and external stakeholders to evaluate business performance and value.
-   [[Financial Accounting|Financial accounting]] calls for all companies to create a balance sheet, income statement, and [[Cash Flow Statement|cash flow statement]] which form the basis for [[Financial Statement Analysis|financial statement analysis]].
-   Horizontal, vertical, and [[Ratio Analysis|ratio analysis]] are three techniques analysts use when analyzing financial statements.

## Financial Performance

Financial statements are maintained by companies daily and used internally for business management. In general both internal and external stakeholders use the same corporate [[Finance|finance]] methodologies for maintaining business activities and evaluating overall [[financial performance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialperformance.asp).

When doing comprehensive [[Financial Statement Analysis|financial statement analysis]], analysts typically use multiple years of data to facilitate horizontal analysis. Each financial statement is also analyzed with vertical analysis to understand how different categories of the statement are influencing results. Finally [[Ratio Analysis|ratio analysis]] can be used to isolate some performance metrics in each statement and also bring together data points across statements collectively.

Below is a breakdown of some of the most common ratio metrics:

Balance sheet: asset turnover, [[Quick Ratio|quick ratio]], receivables turnover, days to sales, [[Debt|debt]] to assets, and debt to [[Equity|equity]]

Income statement: gross [[Profit Margin|profit margin]], [[Operating Profit|operating profit]] margin, net profit margin, tax ratio efficiency, and interest coverage

[[Cash Flow]]: Cash and [[earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp). These metrics may be shown on a per share basis.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is [[Financial Statement Analysis|financial statement analysis]]?

[[Financial Statement Analysis|Financial statement analysis]] is the process of evaluating a company’s performance or value through a company’s balance sheet, income statement, or statement of cash flows. By using a number of techniques such as horizontal, vertical, or [[Ratio Analysis|ratio analysis]], investors may develop a more nuanced picture of a company’s financial profile.

### What are the different types of [[Financial Statement Analysis|financial statement analysis]]?

Most often, analysts [[Will|will]] use three main techniques for analyzing a company's financial statements. First, horizontal analysis involves comparing historical data. Usually, the purpose of horizontal analysis is to detect growth trends across different time periods. Second, vertical analysis compares items on a financial statement in relation to each other. For instance, an expense item could be expressed as a percentage of company sales. Finally, [[Ratio Analysis|ratio analysis]], a central part of fundamental [[Equity|equity]] analysis, compares line-item data. P/E ratios, earnings per share, or dividend [[Yield|yield]] are examples of ratio analysis.

### What is an example of [[Financial Statement Analysis|financial statement analysis]]?

An analyst may first look at a number of ratios on a company’s income statement to determine how efficiently it generates profits and shareholder value. For instance, gross [[Profit Margin|profit margin]] [[Will|will]] show the difference between revenues and the cost of goods sold. If the company has a higher [[Gross Profit|gross profit]] margin than its competitors, this may indicate a positive sign for the company. At the same time, the analyst may observe that the gross profit margin has been increasing over nine fiscal periods, applying a horizontal analysis to the company operating trends.
