[[Learn About Liquidity Risk With Investments]]
## What Is [[Liquidity]] [[Risk]]?

[Liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) is the ability of a firm, company, or even an individual to pay its debts without suffering catastrophic losses. Conversely, liquidity [[Risk|risk]] stems from the lack of marketability of an investment that can't be bought or sold quickly enough to prevent or minimize a loss. It is typically reflected in unusually wide [[bid-ask spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) or large price movements.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Liquidity]] is the ability of a firm, company, or even an individual to pay its debts without suffering catastrophic losses.
-   Investors, managers, and creditors use [[Liquidity|liquidity]] measurement ratios when deciding the level of [[Risk|risk]] within an organization.
-   If an individual investor, business, or financial institution cannot meet its short-term [[Debt|debt]] obligations, it is experiencing [[Liquidity|liquidity]] [[Risk|risk]].

## Understanding [[Liquidity]] [[Risk]]

Common knowledge is that the smaller the size of the [[Security|security]] or its issuer, the larger the [[Liquidity|liquidity]] [[Risk|risk]]. Drops in the value of [[Stocks|stocks]] and other securities motivated many investors to sell their [[Holdings|holdings]] at any price in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, as well as during the 2007 to 2008 global [[credit crisis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-crisis.asp). This rush to the exits caused widening bid-ask spreads and large price declines, which further contributed to market illiquidity.

[[Liquidity]] [[Risk|risk]] occurs when an individual investor, business, or [[financial institution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp) cannot meet its short-term [[Debt|debt]] obligations. The investor or entity might be unable to convert an [[asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) into cash without giving up capital and income due to a lack of buyers or an [[inefficient market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inefficientmarket.asp).

## [[Liquidity]] [[Risk]] in Financial Institutions

Financial institutions depend upon borrowed money to a considerable extent, so they're commonly scrutinized to determine whether they can meet their [[Debt|debt]] obligations without realizing great losses, which could be catastrophic. Institutions, therefore, face strict compliance requirements and stress tests to measure their financial stability.

The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp) (FDIC) released a proposal in April 2016 that created a [[net stable funding ratio]](https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2016/fil16033.html). It was intended to help increase banks’ [[Liquidity|liquidity]] during periods of financial stress. The ratio indicates whether banks own enough high-quality assets that can be easily converted into cash within one year. Banks rely less on short-term funding, which tends to be more volatile.

During the 2008 [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]], many big banks failed or faced insolvency issues due to [[Liquidity|liquidity]] problems. The FDIC ratio is in line with the international [[Basel standard]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basel_accord.asp), created in 2015, and it reduces banks’ vulnerability in the event of another financial crisis.

## [[Liquidity]] [[Risk]] in Companies

Investors, managers, and creditors use [[Liquidity|liquidity]] measurement ratios when deciding the level of [[Risk|risk]] within an organization. They often compare short-term [[liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liability|liability]].asp) and the liquid assets [[Listed|listed]] on a company’s financial statements.

If a business has too much [[Liquidity|liquidity]] [[Risk|risk]], it must sell its assets, bring in additional revenue, or find another way to reduce the discrepancy between available cash and its [[Debt|debt]] obligations.

## Real-World Example

A $500,000 home might have no buyer when the real [[Estate|estate]] market is down, but the home might sell above its [[Listed|listed]] price when the market improves. The owners might sell the home for less and lose money in the transaction if they need cash quickly so must sell while the market is down.

Investors should consider whether they can convert their short-term [[Debt|debt]] obligations into cash before investing in long-term illiquid assets to [[Hedge|hedge]] against [[Liquidity|liquidity]] [[Risk|risk]].
