[[Leveraged Recapitalization Definition]]
## What Is Leveraged Recapitalization?

A leveraged recapitalization is a corporate [[Finance|finance]] transaction in which a company changes its capitalization structure by replacing the majority of its [[Equity|equity]] with a package of [[Debt|debt]] securities consisting of both senior bank debt and subordinated debt. A leveraged recapitalization is also referred to as leveraged recap. In other words, the company [[Will|will]] borrow money in order to buy back [[Shares|shares]] that were previously issued, and reduce the amount of equity in its capital structure. Senior managers/employees may receive additional equity, in order to align their interests with the bondholders and shareholders.

Usually, a leveraged recapitalization is used to prepare the company for a period of growth, since a capitalization structure that leverages [[Debt|debt]] is more beneficial to a company during growth periods. Leveraged recapitalizations are also popular during periods when interest rates are low since low interest rates can make borrowing money to pay off debt or [[Equity|equity]] more affordable for companies.

Leveraged recapitalizations differ from leveraged dividend recapitalizations. In [[dividend recapitalizations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendrecap.asp), the capital structure remains [[Unchanged|unchanged]] because only a special dividend is paid.

## Understanding Leveraged Recapitalization

Leveraged recapitalizations have a similar structure to that employed in leveraged buyouts (LBO), to the extent that they significantly increase financial [[Leverage|leverage]]. But unlike LBOs, they may remain publicly traded. Shareholders are less likely to be impacted by leveraged recapitalizations as compared to new [[Stock|stock]] issuances because issuing new [[Stocks|stocks]] can dilute the value of existing [[Shares|shares]], while borrowing money does not. For this reason, leveraged recapitalizations are looked upon more favorably by shareholders.

They are sometimes used by private [[Equity|equity]] firms to exit some of their investment early or as a source of refinancing. And they have similar impacts to leveraged buybacks unless they are dividend recapitalizations. Using [[Debt|debt]] can provide a tax shield—which might outweigh the extra interest expense. This is known as the Modigliani-Miller theorem, which shows that debt provides tax benefits not accessible via equity. And leveraged recaps can increase [[Earnings Per Share (EPS)|earnings per share (EPS)]], [[Return|return]] on equity and the price to book ratio. Borrowing money to pay off older debts or buy back [[Stock|stock]] also helps companies avoid the opportunity cost of doing so with earned profits.

Like LBOs, leveraged recapitalizations provide incentives for management to be more disciplined and improve operational efficiency, in order to meet larger interest and [[Principal|principal]] payments. They are often are accompanied by a [[restructuring]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restructuring.asp), in which the company sells off assets that are redundant or no longer a strategic fit in order to reduce [[Debt|debt]]. However, the danger is that extremely high [[Leverage|leverage]] can lead a company to lose its strategic focus and become much more vulnerable to unexpected shocks or a recession. If the current debt environment changes, increased interest expenses could threaten corporate viability.

## History of Leveraged Recapitalization

Leveraged recapitalizations were especially popular in the late 1980s when the vast majority of them were used as a [[takeover defense]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Stocks|stocks]]/08/corporate-takeover-defense.asp) in mature industries that do not require substantial ongoing capital expenditures to remain competitive. Increasing the [[Debt|debt]] on the balance sheet, and thus a company’s [[Leverage|leverage]] acts as a shark repellant protection from hostile takeovers by corporate raiders.
