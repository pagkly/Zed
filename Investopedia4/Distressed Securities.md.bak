[[Distressed Securities]]
## What Are [[Distressed Securities]]?

[[Distressed Securities|Distressed securities]] are [financial instruments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp) issued by a company that is near to—or currently going through—[bankruptcy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp). Distressed securities can include common and preferred [[Shares|shares]], bank [[Debt|debt]], trade claims, and [corporate bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp).

A particular [[Security|security]] can also be considered distressed if it fails to maintain certain covenants (obligations incorporated into the [[Debt|debt]] or security, such as the ability to maintain a certain asset to [[Liability|liability]] ratio, or a particular credit [[Rating|rating]].)

As a result of the issuing company's inability to meet its financial obligations, their financial instruments suffer a substantial reduction in value. However, because of the implicit riskiness of [[Distressed Securities|distressed securities]], they can [[Offer|offer]] high-[[Risk|risk]] investors the potential for high returns.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Distressed Securities|Distressed securities]] are securities issued by a company that is near to—or in the midst of—bankruptcy.
-   The company may also have breached covenants (conditions of the [[Security|security]] issuance), which is frequently a precursor to the bankruptcy itself.
-   Certain high-[[Risk|risk]] investors, sometimes known as ‘hawks’, are willing to invest in [[Distressed Securities|distressed securities]] in the hope of making a quick buck.

## Understanding [[Distressed Securities]]

[[Distressed Securities|Distressed securities]] often appeal to investors who are looking for a bargain and are willing to accept [[Risk|risk]]. In some cases, these investors believe the company's situation is not as bad as it looks, and as a result, they anticipate their investments [[Will|will]] increase in value over time. In other cases, investors may foresee the company going into bankruptcy. However, they feel confident that there might be enough money upon liquidation to cover the securities they have purchased.

In many cases, the companies that issue [[Distressed Securities|distressed securities]] end up filing for [Chapter 11](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chapter11.asp) or [[Chapter 7]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chapter7.asp) bankruptcy; as a result, individuals interested in [investing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investing.asp) in these securities need to consider what happens in the case of bankruptcy. In most bankruptcies, [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp)—such as common [[Shares|shares]]—is rendered worthless. This makes investing in distressed [[Stocks|stocks]] extremely risky. However, senior [[Debt|debt]] instruments, such as bank debt, trade claims, and bonds, may [[Yield|yield]] some [[Payout|payout]].

In particular, if a business files Chapter 7 bankruptcy it [[Will|will]] stop operations and go into [liquidation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp). At this point, its funds are dispensed to its creditors, including bondholders.

Conversely, under [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy, a business restructures and continues operations. If reorganization is successful, its [[Distressed Securities|distressed securities]], including both [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds, may [[Yield|yield]] surprising amounts of profits.

## Example of a Distressed [[Security]]

Securities are labeled as distressed when the company issuing them is unable to meet many of its financial obligations. In most cases, these securities carry a "CCC" or below credit [[Rating|rating]] from [[Debt|debt]]-rating agencies, such as Standard and Poor's or Moody's Investor Services. [[Distressed Securities|Distressed securities]] can be contrasted with junk bonds, which traditionally have a credit rating of BBB or lower.

Typically, the anticipated rate of [[Return|return]] on a distressed [[Security|security]] is more than 1,000 basis points above the rate of return of a so-called [[Risk|risk]]-free asset, such as a U.S. Treasury bill or Treasury bond. For example, if the [[Yield|yield]] on a five-year Treasury bond is 1%, a distressed corporate bond has a rate of return of 11% or higher, based on the fact that one basis point equates to 0.01%.
