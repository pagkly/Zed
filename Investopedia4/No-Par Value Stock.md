[[No-Par Value Stock]]
## What Is [[No-Par Value Stock]]?

[[No-Par Value Stock|No-par value stock]] is issued without the specification of a par value indicated in a company's [[articles of incorporation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/articlesofincorporation.asp) or on its [[stock certificates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockcertificate.asp). Most [[Shares|shares]] issued are classified as no-par or low-par value [[Stock|stock]], where prices of the latter are determined by the amount of cash investors are willing to pony up for the [[Stocks|stocks]] on the open market.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[No-Par Value Stock|No-par value stock]] is issued without a par value. 
-   The value of no-par value [[Stocks|stocks]] is determined by the price investors are willing to pay on the open market. 
-   The advantage of [[No-Par Value Stock|no-par value stock]] is that companies can then issue [[Stock|stock]] at higher prices in future offerings. 
-   While [[No-Par Value Stock|no-par value stock]] is issued with no face value, low-par value [[Stock|stock]] is issued with a price as low as $0.01. 
-   On the downside of low-par value [[Stock|stock]], if the issuing company defaults or shutters its doors, analysts may assume it was never fully capitalized to begin with. 

## Understanding [[No-Par Value Stock]]

Companies may find it beneficial to issue [[No-Par Value Stock|no-par value stock]] because doing so gives them the flexibility to set higher prices for future [[public offerings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publicoffering.asp). This reduces the downside [[Risk|risk]] for shareholders if the [[Stock|stock]] price sharply plummets. Because of the known fluctuations in pricing associated with the stock market, many investors typically do not deem [[par]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/par.asp) necessary prior to purchasing a particular investment. In addition, the production of [[Stocks|stocks]] with a face value may result in legal liabilities regarding the difference between the current going rate and the par value assigned to the stocks, making them a less attractive option for issuers.

When companies issue [[No-Par Value Stock|no-par value stock]], the price may experience natural variations. A no-par [[Stock|stock]]’s sale price can be determined by the basic principles of [[Supply|supply]] and demand, fluctuating as necessary to meet market conditions without being misrepresented by the face value.

Some states forbid corporations from issuing no-par [[Stock|stock]]. 

## Special Considerations

If a business releases [[Stock|stock]] with a low-par value of $5.00 per share and 1,000 [[Shares|shares]] are sold, the associated book value of the business can then be [[Listed|listed]] as $5,000. If the business is generally successful, this value may be of no consequence. But if the business collapses while currently owing a [[Creditor|creditor]] $3,000, the indebted company may call for a review of the delinquent company's accounting statements, which may reveal that the failed business was not fully [[capitalized]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalize.asp). This can prompt the owed business to exercise its legal right to require shareholders to contribute to the repayment of the [[Debt|debt]].

## [[No-Par Value Stock]] vs. Low-Par Value [[Stock]]

No-par value [[Stocks|stocks]] are printed with no face value designation, while low-par value stocks may show an amount lower than $0.01, all the way up to a few dollars. Many times, when a smaller company seeks to lower the number of its shareholders, it may choose to issue stocks with a face value of $1.00. This small amount can then function as a line item for accounting purposes.
