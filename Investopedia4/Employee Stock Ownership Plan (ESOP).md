[[Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)]]
## What Is an [[Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)]]?

An [[Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)|employee stock ownership plan (ESOP)]] is an employee benefit plan that gives workers ownership interest in the company. ESOPs give the sponsoring company, the selling [[shareholder]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp), and participants receive various tax benefits, making them qualified plans. Companies often use ESOPs as a [[corporate-finance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatefinance.asp) strategy to align the interests of their employees with those of their shareholders.

### Key Takeaways

-   An employee [[Stock|stock]] ownership plan gives workers ownership interest in the company.
-   ESOP is usually formed to allow employees the opportunity to buy [[Stock|stock]] in a closely held company to facilitate succession planning.
-   ESOPs encourage employees to do what's best for shareholders since the employees themselves are shareholders and provide companies with tax benefits, thus incentivizing owners to [[Offer|offer]] them to employees.
-   Companies typically tie distributions from the plan to vesting.

## Understanding Employee [[Stock]] Ownership Plans (ESOP)

An ESOP is usually formed to facilitate succession planning in a closely held company by allowing employees the opportunity to buy [[Stock|stock]]. ESOPs are set up as trust funds and can be funded by companies putting newly issued [[Shares|shares]] into them, putting cash in to buy existing company shares, or borrowing money through the entity to buy company shares. ESOPs are used by companies of all sizes including a number of large publicly traded corporations.

Since ESOP [[Shares|shares]] are part of the employees' [[Remuneration|remuneration]] package, companies can use ESOPs to keep plan participants focused on corporate performance and share price appreciation. By giving plan participants an interest in seeing the company's [[Stock|stock]] perform well, these plans supposedly encourage participants to do what's best for shareholders, since the participants themselves are shareholders.

### Upfront Costs and Distributions

Companies often provide employees with such ownership with no upfront costs. The company may [[Hold|hold]] the provided [[Shares|shares]] in a trust for safety and growth until the employee retires or resigns from the company. Companies typically tie distributions from the plan to vesting—the proportion of shares earned for each year of service.

After becoming fully vested, the company "purchases" the vested [[Shares|shares]] from the retiring or resigning employee. The money from the purchase goes to the employee in a lump sum or equal periodic payments, depending on the plan. Once the company purchases the shares and pays the employee, the company redistributes or voids the shares. Employees who resign or retire cannot take the shares of [[Stock|stock]] with them, only the cash payment. Fired employees often only qualify for the amount they have vested in the plan.

Employee-owned corporations are companies with majority [[Holdings|holdings]] held by their own employees. These organizers are like cooperatives, except that the company does not distribute its capital equally. Many of these companies only provide voting rights to particular shareholders. Companies may also give senior employees the benefit of more [[Shares|shares]] compared to new employees.

## ESOP and Other Forms of Employee Ownership

[[Stock]] ownership plans provide packages that act as additional benefits for employees to prevent hostility and keep a specific corporate culture that company managements want to maintain.

Other versions of employee ownership include direct-purchase programs, [[Stock|stock]] options, [[restricted stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp), phantom stock, and stock appreciation rights. Direct-purchase plans let employees purchase [[Shares|shares]] of their respective companies with their personal after-tax money. Some countries provide special tax-qualified plans that let employees purchase company stock at discounted prices. 

### [[Restricted Stock]], [[Stock]] Options, and Phantom Stock

[[Restricted Stock|Restricted stock]] gives the employees the right to receive [[Shares|shares]] as a gift or a purchased item after meeting particular restrictions, such as working for a specific period or hitting specific performance targets. [[Stock]] options provide employees with the opportunity to buy shares at a fixed price for a set period, while phantom stock provides [[cash bonuses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-bonus.asp) for good employee performance.

These bonuses equate to the value of a particular number of [[Shares|shares]]. [[Stock]] appreciation rights give employees the right to raise the value of an assigned number of shares. Companies usually pay these shares in cash.
