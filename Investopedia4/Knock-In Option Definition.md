[[Knock-In Option Definition]]
## What is a Knock-In Option?

A knock-in option is a latent option contract that begins to function as a normal option ("knocks in") only once a certain [[Price Level|price level]] is reached before expiration. Knock-ins are a type of [[barrier option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrieroption.asp) that are classified as either a [down-and-in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daio.asp) or an [[up-and-in]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/up-and-inoption.asp). A barrier option is a type of contract in which the payoff depends on the [[underlying security's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-[[Security|security]].asp) price and whether it hits a certain price within a specified period.

### Key Takeaways

-   A knock-in option is a type of barrier option which is triggered only after the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset's price reaches a certain specified barrier.
-   There are two types of knock-in options: down-and-in and up-and-in. In the former, the option is triggered only if the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset's price falls below a certain level. The latter type of option is triggered only after an underlying asset's price rises to a certain level.

## Understanding Knock-In Options

Knock-in options are one of the two main types of barrier options, with the other type being [[knock-out options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knock-outoption.asp).

A knock-in option is a type of contract that is not an option until a certain price is met. So if the price is never reached, it is as if the contract never existed. However, if the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset reaches a specified barrier, the knock-in option comes into existence. The difference between a knock-in and knock-out option is that a knock-in option comes into existence only when the underlying [[Security|security]] reaches a barrier, while a knock-out option ceases to exist when the underlying security reaches a barrier.

Barrier options typically have cheaper [[premiums]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp) than traditional [[vanilla options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vanillaoption.asp), primarily because the barrier increases the chances of the option expiring worthless. A trader may choose the cheaper (relative to a comparable vanilla) barrier option if they feel it is quite likely the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Will|will]] hit the barrier.

## Down-and-In Knock-In Option

Assume an investor purchases a down-and-in [[put option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) with a barrier price of $90 and a [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) of $100. The [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] is trading at $110, and the option [[expires]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp) in three months. If the price of the underlying security reaches $90, the option comes into existence and becomes a vanilla option with a strike price of $100. Thereafter, the holder of the option has the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price of $100, even though it is trading below $90. It is this right that gives the option value.

The put option remains active until the expiration date, even if the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] rebounds back above $90. However, if the underlying asset does not fall below the barrier price during the life of the contract, the down-and-in option expires worthless. Just because the barrier is reached does not assure a profit on the trade since the underlying would need to stay below $100 (after triggering the barrier) in order for the option to have value.

## Up-and-In Knock-In Option

Contrary to a down-and-in option, an up-and-in option comes into existence only if the [[Underlying|underlying]] reaches a barrier price that is above the current underlying's price. For example, assume a trader purchases a one-month up-and-in [[call option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on an underlying asset when it is trading at $40 per share. The up-and-in call option contract has a strike price of $50 and a barrier of $55. If the underlying asset does not reach $55 during the life of the option contract, it expires worthless. However, if the underlying asset rises to $55 or above, the call option would come into existence and the trader would be [[in the money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp).
