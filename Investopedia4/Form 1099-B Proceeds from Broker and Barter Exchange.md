## Who Can File Form 1099-B: Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange?

Brokers must submit a 1099-B form to the IRS as well as sending a copy directly to every customer who sold [[Stocks|stocks]], [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), [[commodities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), or other securities during the tax year. The IRS requires submission of the form to serve as a record of a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]’s gains or losses.

Assume, for example, you sold several [[Stocks|stocks]] last year. The proceeds of the sale were $10,000. That figure [[Will|will]] be reported to the IRS from two sources: One from the brokerage on a 1099-B and the second from you as a report of a taxable [[capital gain]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp).

Information on a 1099-B includes a description of each investment, the purchase date and price, the sale date and price, and the resulting [[Gain|gain]] or loss.2 Commissions for these transactions are excluded.

As a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]], your [[capital losses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalloss.asp) are subtracted from any capital gains and may be used to reduce the [[Taxable Income|taxable income]] you report. There are limits to the amount of [[capital loss that can be deducted]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-[[Stock|stock]]-losses-your-tax-bill.asp) each tax year. However, if the capital loss exceeds the limit, the difference may be [[carried over]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-loss-carryover.asp) to the following tax year (or years).

The form [[Will|will]] report the cash received and the [[fair market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp) of goods or services received or any [[trade credits]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-credit.asp) received.
