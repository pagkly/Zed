[[Junior Equity Definition]]
## What Is Junior [[Equity]]?

Junior [[Equity|equity]] is [[stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp) issued by a company that ranks at the bottom of the priority ladder in terms of ownership structure. [[Common stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp) is often referred to as junior equity because it is subordinate to [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   Junior [[Equity|equity]] is [[Stock|stock]] issued by a company that ranks at the bottom of the priority ladder in terms of ownership structure.
-   [[Common Stock|Common stock]] is subordinate to [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] and is therefore referred to as junior [[Equity|equity]].
-   In the event of a bankruptcy, junior [[Equity|equity]] owners must wait for bondholders, preferred shareholders and other debtholders to collect first.
-   Holders of junior [[Equity|equity]] also play second fiddle to [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] owners when it comes to company dividends.

## How Junior [[Equity]] Works

[Equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp), otherwise known as [[net worth]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networth.asp), represents the amount of money that would be returned to [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) if all of the company’s [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) were [[liquidated]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp) and [[debts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp) were paid off. Not all shareholders have equal rights, though. There is a pecking order determining who can claim company assets first and owners of subordinate equity sit at the bottom of it.

That means that in the event of a [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp), holders of junior [[Equity|equity]] may get nothing in [[Return|return]]. Common shareholders have rights to a company's assets only after [[bondholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp), preferred shareholders and other debtholders are paid in full.

The pay-out structure of a company in bankruptcy is governed by the Absolute Priority Rule, which states that in liquidation certain creditors must be satisfied in full before any other creditors receive any payments.

Junior [[Equity|equity]] also takes a back seat to [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] when it comes to [[income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp) distribution. Preferred stockholders receive an agreed-upon [[dividend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) at regular intervals, making them similar to [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). In contrast, a company’s [[board of directors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp) (B of D) may not pay common stockholders a dividend if it is not generating enough [[profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp). In short, compensating preferred stockholders takes priority for company executives.

## Example of Junior [[Equity]]

Larry’s Lemonade needs money to buy more lemons in order to fulfill a major purchase order. Management decides to issue bonds as part of a [[Debt|debt]] program, while concurrently receiving an influx of cash from an [[investment bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentbank.asp) (IB), in the form of a high-[interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) [[loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Loan|loan]].asp).

Trading at Larry’s Lemonade then takes a turn for the worse, forcing it to shutter its operation and declare bankruptcy. Everyone with a stake in the company is eager to collect any leftover money. Priority first goes to the bondholders, those who lent Larry Lemonade capital to buy more lemons, followed by the [[lending institution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) that gave it a high-interest [[Loan|loan]].

Only after those two groups have been paid, do the junior [[Equity|equity]] holders of [[Common Stock|common stock]] have an opportunity to absorb any remaining assets. At that stage, very little assets are left to collect, leaving them with empty pockets.

## Advantages of Junior [[Equity]]

Fortunately, there are some advantages to owning junior [[Equity|equity]]. The majority of [[Shares|shares]] that companies issue is [[Common Stock|common stock]] and, over the years, this type of equity ownership has outperformed bonds and preferred shares. When a company thrives, junior equity is generally the best type of [[Stock|stock]] to [[Hold|hold]].

Unlike [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], owning [[Common Stock|common stock]] also gives shareholders [[voting rights]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp), meaning they can have a voice, albeit a very quiet one, in how the business is run. 

## Special Considerations

Investors should always consider the risks outlined above before buying junior [[Equity|equity]]. It is important to exercise prudence, particularly when dealing with companies that borrow excessively and operate in [[sectors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector.asp) in [[structural]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/structural_change.asp) decline, such as retail.
