[[What the Loan Life Coverage Ratio (LLCR) Measures]]
## What Is the [[Loan]] Life [[Coverage Ratio]] (LLCR)?

The [[Loan|loan]] life [[Coverage Ratio|coverage ratio]] (LLCR) is a financial ratio used to estimate the solvency of a firm, or the ability of a borrowing company to repay an outstanding loan. LLCR is calculated by dividing the [[net present value (NPV)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) of the money available for [[Debt|debt]] [[repayment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp) by the amount of outstanding debt. 

LLCR is similar to the [[debt service coverage ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dscr.asp) (DSCR), but it is more commonly used in project financing because of its long-term nature. The DSCR captures a single point in time, whereas the LLCR addresses the entire span of the [[loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Loan|loan]].asp).

## The Formula for the [[Loan]] Life [[Coverage Ratio]] (LLCR) Is

## How to Calculate the [[Loan]] Life [[Coverage Ratio]]

The LLCR can be calculated using the above formula, or by using a shortcut: dividing the NPV of project free cash flows by the present value of the [[Debt|debt]] outstanding.

In this calculation, the [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]] is the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] for the NPV calculation and the project "cash flows" are more specifically the [[cash flows available for debt service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cads.asp) (CFADS).

## What Does the [[Loan]] Life [[Coverage Ratio]] Tell You?

LLCR is a [[solvency ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solvencyratio.asp). The [[Loan|loan]] life [[Coverage Ratio|coverage ratio]] is a measure of the number of times over the cash flows of a project can repay an outstanding [[Debt|debt]] over the life of a loan. A ratio of 1.0x means that LLCR is at a break-even level. The higher the ratio, the less potential [[Risk|risk]] there is for the [[Lender|lender]].

Depending on the [[Risk|risk]] profile of the project, sometimes a [[Debt Service|debt service]] reserve account is required by the [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp). In such a case, the numerator of LLCR would include the reserve account balance. Project financing agreements invariably contain covenants that stipulate LLCR levels.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Loan|loan]] life [[Coverage Ratio|coverage ratio]] (LLCR) is a financial ratio used to estimate the solvency of a firm, or the ability of a borrowing company to repay an outstanding loan.
-   The [[Loan|loan]] life [[Coverage Ratio|coverage ratio]] is a measure of the number of times over the cash flows of a project can repay an outstanding [[Debt|debt]] over the life of a loan.
-   The higher the ratio, the less potential [[Risk|risk]] there is for the [[Lender|lender]].

## The Difference Between LLCR and DSCR

In corporate [[Finance|finance]], the [[Debt-Service Coverage Ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dscr.asp) (DSCR) is a measure of the [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] available to pay current [[Debt|debt]] obligations. The ratio states net operating income as a multiple of debt obligations due within one year, including interest, [[Principal|principal]], sinking-fund and [[Lease|lease]] payments. However, DSCR captures just a single point in time, while LLCR allows for several time periods, which is more suitable for understanding [[Liquidity|liquidity]] available for loans of medium to long time horizons.

LLCR is used by analysts to assess the viability of a given amount of [[Debt|debt]] and consequently to evaluate the [[Risk|risk]] profile and the related costs. It has a less immediate explanation compared to DSCR, but when LLCR has a value greater than one, this is usually a strong reassurance for investors.

## Limitations of LLCR

One limitation of the LLCR is that it does not pick up weak periods because it basically represents a discounted average that can smooth out rough patches. For this reason, if a project has a steady cash flows with a history of [[Loan|loan]] repayment, a good [[Rule Of Thumb|rule of thumb]] is that the LLCR should be roughly equal to the average [[Debt Service|debt service]] [[Coverage Ratio|coverage ratio]].
