[[Foreign Currency Swap]]
## What Is a [[Foreign Currency Swap]]?

A foreign [[currency swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyswap.asp), also known as an FX [[Swap|swap]], is an agreement to [[exchange currency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-exchange.asp) between two foreign parties. The agreement consists of swapping [[Principal|principal]] and interest payments on a [[Loan|loan]] made in one currency for principal and interest payments of a loan of equal value in another currency. One party borrows currency from a second party as it simultaneously lends another currency to that party.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Foreign Currency Swap|foreign currency swap]] is an agreement to exchange currency between two foreign parties, in which they [[Swap|swap]] [[Principal|principal]] and interest payments on a [[Loan|loan]] made in one currency for a loan of equal value in another currency.
-   There are two main types of currency swaps: fixed-for-fixed currency swaps and fixed-for-floating swaps.

## Understanding Foreign Currency Swaps

The purpose of engaging in a [[currency swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042315/how-do-currency-swaps-work.asp) is usually to procure loans in foreign currency at more favorable interest rates than if borrowing directly in a foreign market. The World Bank first introduced currency swaps in 1981 in an effort to obtain German marks and Swiss francs. This type of [[Swap|swap]] can be done on loans with [[maturities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp) as long as 10 years. Currency swaps differ from [[interest rate swaps]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp) in that they also involve [[Principal|principal]] exchanges.

In a currency [[Swap|swap]], each party continues to pay interest on the swapped [[Principal|principal]] amounts throughout the length of the [[Loan|loan]]. When the swap is over, principal amounts are exchanged once more at a pre-agreed rate (which would avoid [[transaction risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transactionrisk.asp)) or the [[spot rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spot_rate.asp).

There are two main types of currency swaps. The [[fixed-for-fixed]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-fixedswap.asp) currency [[Swap|swap]] involves exchanging fixed interest payments in one currency for fixed interest payments in another. In the [[fixed-for-floating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed_floatswap.asp) swap, fixed interest payments in one currency are exchanged for floating interest payments in another. In the latter type of swap, the [[Principal|principal]] amount of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Loan|loan]] is not exchanged.

## Examples of Foreign Currency Swaps

A common reason to employ a currency [[Swap|swap]] is to secure cheaper [[Debt|debt]]. For example, European Company A borrows $120 million from U.S. Company B; concurrently, European Company A lends 100 million euros to U.S. Company B. The exchange is based on a $1.2 [[Spot Rate|spot rate]], indexed to the [[London InterBank Offered Rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) (LIBOR). The deal allows for borrowing at the most favorable rate.

In addition, some institutions use currency swaps to reduce exposure to anticipated fluctuations in exchange rates. If U.S. Company A and Swiss Company B are looking to obtain each otherâ€™s currencies (Swiss francs and USD, respectively), the two companies can reduce their respective exposures via a currency [[Swap|swap]].

During the [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] in 2008 the [[Federal Reserve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp) allowed several developing countries, facing [[Liquidity|liquidity]] problems, the option of a currency [[Swap|swap]] for borrowing purposes.1
