[[OTCQB]]
## What Is the [[OTCQB]]?

The [[OTCQB]], also called "The Venture Market," is the middle tier of the [[over-the-counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) market for U.S. [[Stocks|stocks]]. It was created in 2010 and consists mainly of early-stage and developing U.S. and international companies that are not yet able to qualify for the [OTCQX](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcqx.asp) but are not as speculative as the lowest-tier [[Pink Sheets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp).

The [[OTCQB]] replaced the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ([FINRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp))-operated OTC Bulletin Board ([OTCBB](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcbb.asp)) as the main market for trading OTC securities that report to a U.S. regulator. As it has no minimum financial standards, the OTCQB often includes shell companies, [[penny stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp), and small foreign issuers.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[OTCQB]] is the mid-tier OTC [[Equity Market|equity market]], which lists primarily early-stage and developing companies in the U.S. and [[International Markets|international markets]], largely replacing the OTCBB system.
-   [[OTCQB]] companies must meet certain minimum reporting standards, pass a bid test, and undergo annual verification.
-   The other OTC tiers are the highest quality OTCQX, and the most speculative Pink Sheets

## Basics of the [[OTCQB]]

The over-the-counter or OTC market is a decentralized market where securities not [[Listed|listed]] on major exchanges are traded directly by a network of [[dealers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dealer.asp). Instead of providing an order matchmaking service like the [[NYSE]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp), these dealers carry inventories of securities in order to facilitate any buy and sell orders.

The [[OTCQB]] marketplace is run through OTC Link, an inter-dealer quotation and trading system developed by OTC Markets Group. OTC Link is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer and also as an [[alternative trading system (ATS).]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative-trading-system.asp) OTC Link enables broker-dealers to not only post and disseminate their quotes, but also negotiate trades through the system’s electronic messaging capability. This feature enabled it to effectively replace FINRA’s OTCBB, which was a quotation-only system.

All broker-dealers that trade [[OTCQB]], [[OTCQX,]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcqx.asp) and [[OTC Pink]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc-pink.asp) securities have to be FINRA members and registered with the SEC; they are also subject to state securities regulations. As with exchange-traded securities, investors trading OTC securities are protected from an unethical broker-dealer’s illegal practices by the same SEC/FINRA rules such as [[Best Execution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bestexecution.asp), [[Limit Order]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) Protection, [[Firm Quotes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firmquote.asp), and [[Short Position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) Disclosure.

## Rules of the [[OTCQB]]

To be eligible, companies must be current in their reporting, undergo annual verification and certification, meet a $0.01 bid test, and may not be in bankruptcy. Companies [[Listed|listed]] here report to a U.S. regulator such as the [[SEC]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) or [[FDIC]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp). The fees for listing on [[OTCQB]] markets is $12,000 per annum, with a one-time application fee of $2,500.

Companies trading on the [[OTCQB]] must follow standards to improve transparency and exclude companies that are most likely to be associated with [[Stock|stock]] promoters and other shady operators. And while [[stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) trading in the OTCQB have many of the same protections as more established, larger [[Stocks|stocks]], they are still considered to be more speculative penny stocks.

There is also no guarantee that [[Stocks|stocks]] trading in the OTC market are of higher quality than penny stocks trading on different OTC tiers or even different OTC marketplaces. As such, traders would be well served to implement strong [[due diligence]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) before committing their capital.
