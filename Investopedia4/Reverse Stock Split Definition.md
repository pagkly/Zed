[[Reverse Stock Split Definition]]
## What Is a Reverse [[Stock Split]]?

A reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]] is a type of [[corporate action]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporateaction.asp) that consolidates the number of existing [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock|stock]] into fewer, proportionally more valuable, shares. Reducing the total number of [[outstanding shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) in the open market can be pursued for a number of reasons, and often signals a company in distress.

A reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]] divides the existing total quantity of [[Shares|shares]] by a number such as five or ten, which would then be called a 1-for-5 or 1-for-10 reverse split, respectively. A reverse [[Stock|stock]] split is also known as a stock consolidation, stock merge, or share rollback and is the opposite exercise of a [[stock split]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksplit.asp), where a share is divided (split) into multiple parts.

### Key Takeaways

-   A reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]] consolidates the number of existing [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock|stock]] held by shareholders into fewer, proportionally more valuable, shares.
-   A reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]] does not directly impact a company's value.
-   It does, however, often signal a company in distress since it raises the value of otherwise low-priced [[Shares|shares]].
-   Remaining relevant and avoiding being delisted are the most common reasons for corporations to pursue this strategy.

## Understanding Reverse [[Stock]] Splits

Depending on market developments and situations, companies can take several actions at the corporate level that may impact their [[capital structure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp). One of these is a reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]], whereby existing [[Shares|shares]] of corporate [[Stock|stock]] are effectively merged to create a smaller number of proportionally more valuable shares. Since companies don’t create any value by decreasing the number of shares, the price per share increases proportionally.

Per-share price bumping is the primary reason why companies opt for reverse [[Stock|stock]] splits, and the associated ratios may range from 1-for-2 to as high as 1-for-100. Reverse stock splits do not impact a corporation's [[value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp), although they are usually a result of its stock having shed substantial value. The negative connotation associated with such an act is often self-defeating as the stock is subject to renewed selling pressure.

Reverse [[Stock|stock]] splits are proposed by company management and are subject to consent from the [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) through their [[voting rights]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp).

### Important

The exchange may temporarily append a suffix (D) to the company’s ticker symbol to indicate that the company is going through a reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]] exercise.

## Example of a Reverse [[Stock Split]]

Say a pharmaceutical company has ten million outstanding [[Shares|shares]] in the market, which are trading at a price of $5 per share. As the share price is lower, the company management may wish to artificially inflate the per-share price.

They decide to go for the 1-for-5 reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]], which essentially means merging five existing [[Shares|shares]] into one new share. Once the corporate action exercise is over, the company [[Will|will]] have (10 million / 5) 2 million new shares, with each share now costing ($5 \* 5) $25 apiece.

The proportionate change in share price also supports the fact that the company has not created any real value simply by performing the reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]]. Its overall value, represented by [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp), before and after the corporate action should remain the same.

-   _Earlier Market Cap_ = Earlier no. of total [[Shares|shares]] \* earlier price per share = 10 million \* $5 = $50 million
-   _New Market Cap_ = New no. of total [[Shares|shares]] \* new price per share = 2 million \* $25 = $50 million

The factor by which the company's management decides to go for the reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]] becomes the multiple by which the market automatically adjusts the share price.

## Benefits of Reverse [[Stock]] Splits

There are [[a number of reasons why]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071415/why-would-company-perform-reverse-[[Stock|stock]]-split.asp) a company may decide to reduce its number of outstanding [[Shares|shares]] in the market.

### Prevent Removal from Major Exchange

A share price may have tumbled to record low levels, which might make it vulnerable to further market pressure and other untoward developments, such as a failure to fulfill the exchange [listing requirements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listingrequirements.asp). An exchange generally specifies a minimum [bid price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bidprice.asp) for a [[Stock|stock]] to be [[Listed|listed]]. If the stock falls below this bid price and remains lower than that threshold level over a certain period, it risks being delisted from the exchange.

For example, [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ]] may delist a [[Stock|stock]] that is consistently trading below $1 per share.1 Removal from a national-level exchange relegates the company's [[Shares|shares]] to penny stock status, forcing them to list on the [[Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcbb.asp) or the [[Pink Sheets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp). Once placed in these alternative marketplaces for low-value [[Stocks|stocks]], the shares become harder to buy and sell.

### Attract Big Investors

Companies also maintain higher share prices through reverse [[Stock|stock]] splits because many [[institutional investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) and mutual funds have policies against taking positions in a stock whose price is below a minimum value. Even if a company remains free of [[Delisting|delisting]] [[Risk|risk]] by the exchange, its failure to qualify for purchase by such large-sized investors mars its trading [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) and reputation.

### Satisfy Regulators

In different jurisdictions across the globe, a company’s regulation depends upon the number of shareholders, among other factors. By reducing the number of [[Shares|shares]], companies at times aim to lower the number of shareholders in order to come under the purview of their preferred regulator or preferred set of laws. Companies that want to [[go private]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/going-private.asp) may also attempt to reduce the number of shareholders through such measures.

### Boost Spinoff Prices

Companies planning to create and float a [[spinoff]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spinoff.asp), an independent company constructed through the sale or distribution of new [[Shares|shares]] of an existing business or division of a [[parent company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parentcompany.asp), might also use reverse splits to [[Gain|gain]] attractive prices. For example, if shares of a company planning a spinoff are trading at lower levels, it may be difficult for it to price its spinoff company shares at a higher price. This issue could potentially be remedied by reverse splitting the shares and increasing how much each of them trade for.

## Criticisms of Reverse [[Stock]] Splits

Generally, a reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]] is not perceived positively by market participants. It indicates that the [[Stock|stock]] price has gone to the bottom and that the company management is attempting to inflate the prices artificially without any real business proposition.

Additionally, the [[Liquidity|liquidity]] may also take a toll with the number of [[Shares|shares]] getting reduced in the open market.

## Real-World Examples of Reverse [[Stock]] Splits

Reverse [[Stock|stock]] splits have been popular in the post [[dotcom bubble]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp) era, when many companies saw their stock price decline to record low levels. In the year 2001 alone, more than [700 companies went for reverse stock splits](http://www.nicmr.com/nicmr/english/report/repo/2002/2002win04.pdf).2

In April 2002, the largest communications company in the U.S., AT&T Inc. ([T](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=t)), announced that it was planning a 1-for-5 reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]], in addition to plans of spinning off its cable TV division and merging it with Comcast Corp. ([CMCSA](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=cmcsa)). The corporate action was planned as AT&T feared that the spinoff could lead to a significant decline in its share price and could impact [[Liquidity|liquidity]], business, and its ability to raise capital.34

Other regular instances of reverse [[Stock|stock]] splits include many small, often non-profitable companies involved in [[research and development]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp) (R&D), which do not have any profit-making or marketable product or service. In such cases, companies undergo this corporate action simply to maintain their listing on a premier [[stock exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/092404.asp).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why would a company undergo a reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]]?

Reverse splits are usually done when the share prices falls too low, putting it at [[Risk|risk]] for de-listing from an exchange for not meeting certain minimum price requirements. Having a higher share price can also attract certain investors who would not consider penny [[Stocks|stocks]] for their portfolios.

### What happens if I own [[Shares|shares]] that undergo a reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]]?

With a reverse split, shareholders of record [[Will|will]] see the number of [[Shares|shares]] they own be reduced, but also see the price of each share increase in a comparable manner. For instance, in a 1:10 reverse [[Stock Split|stock split]], if you owned 1,000 shares that were trading at $5 just before the split, you would then own 100 shares at $50 each. Your broker would handle this automatically, so there is nothing you need to do. A reverse split will not affect your taxes.

### Are reverse splits good or bad?

Many times reverse splits are viewed negatively, as they signal that a company's share price has declined significantly, possibly putting it at [[Risk|risk]] of being de-[[Listed|listed]]. The higher-priced [[Shares|shares]] following the split may also be less attractive to certain retail investors who prefer [[Stocks|stocks]] with lower sticker prices.

### Why does the ETN I own have so many reverse splits?

Some exchange-traded products like ETNs ([exchange-traded notes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etn.asp)) naturally decay in value over time and must undergo reverse splits on a regular basis, but these products are not intended to be held for longer than a few hours or days. This is because ETNs are technically [[Debt|debt]] instruments that [[Hold|hold]] derivatives on products like commodities or [[Volatility|volatility]]-linked instruments and not the actual [[Underlying|underlying]] assets.
