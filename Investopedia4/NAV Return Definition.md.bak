[[NAV Return Definition]]
## What Is NAV [[Return]]?

The NAV [[Return|return]] is the change in the [net asset value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp) of a [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) or ETF over a given time period. The NAV return of a mutual fund is one measure of return and can be different than the total return or the market return that investors realize because these products can trade [at a premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-a-[[Premium|premium]].asp) or [discount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discount.asp) in the market to the fund's computed NAV.

### Key Takeaways

-   The net asset value (NAV) [[Return|return]] is a way of computing an ETF's or mutual fund's performance over time by looking at the value of its components.
-   Rather than taking the fund's market [[Value Change|value change]] or total [[Return|return]], a NAV return uses the fund's change in net asset value over time instead.
-   NAV can differ from a fund's market price since it is computed end-of-day, while the securities held inside of a fund trade throughout each trading day.

## Understanding NAV [[Return]]

The NAV [[Return|return]] is calculated based on the daily NAV of the fund reported after the [[Stock|stock]] market's close each trading day. The NAV is a basic calculation performed by the fund's accountants. It represents the total assets minus total liabilities divided by outstanding [[Shares|shares]]. The value changes daily with the fluctuation of assets based on market value. The NAV return is a transparent accounting measure that reports the actual assets in the fund at the end of the day. Therefore, [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp), interest, and capital gains distributions paid out to shareholders would not be included in the total assets unless they were reinvested.

The total [[Return|return]] of a mutual fund provides a performance figure that includes distribution payouts. Therefore, it accounts for distributions associated with the fund that are paid out to [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) regardless of whether or not these distributions are reinvested in the total assets of the fund. Distribution payouts are the primary reason an investor [[Will|will]] see variations in NAV versus total return.

Investment funds that trade on exchanges with daily pricing, such as closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds, may also have a market price and a market [[Return|return]]. Funds trading in real time with a market price can incur a market [[Premium|premium]] or discount that causes their market return to vary from the NAV return. Funds trading above their NAV are said to trade at a premium. Funds trading below their NAV are trading at a discount. Premiums and discounts may occur due to the real-time valuations of securities in the fund versus their daily NAV. Funds typically trade close to their NAV with some deviation. If a fund varies excessively from its NAV, then authorized participants may intervene to help correct the price.

## NAV [[Return]] and Fund Performance Reporting

Investment companies provide transparency in their fund performance reporting to help investors identify the NAV [[Return|return]], total return, and market return. Investors should monitor the returns they use to track the performance of their investments. Ensuring understanding of fund performance calculations [[Will|will]] help an investor's due diligence and performance comparisons. 

Most closed-end funds and ETFs [[Will|will]] provide performance reporting that includes both the NAV [[Return|return]] and the market value return. The [Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund](https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/cef/fund/gof) provides one example of a closed-end fund. The Fund's investments are based on both quantitative and [[Qualitative Analysis|qualitative analysis]]. Investments span across asset classes including fixed income, [[Equity|equity]], and [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]]. As of Jan. 9, 2018, the Fund was reporting a 10.21% [[Premium|premium]] to NAV. It's closing NAV on Jan. 9 was $19.78 versus a closing market value price of $21.80. The Fund also has a 52-week average premium of 6.54%.
