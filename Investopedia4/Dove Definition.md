[[Dove Definition]]
## What Is a Dove?

A dove is an economic policy advisor who promotes [[monetary policies]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052813/how-monetary-policy-affects-your-investments.asp) that usually involve low-interest rates. Doves tend to support [[low-interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/051415/5-countries-lowest-interest-rates.asp) and an expansionary monetary policy because they value indicators like low [[Unemployment|unemployment]] over keeping inflation low. If an economist suggests that [[inflation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) has few negative effects or calls for quantitative easing, then they are called a dove or labeled as dovish.

### Key Takeaways

-   Doves are perceived as being more interested in spurring job growth through low-interest rates than they are in controlling inflation.
-   Critics argue that a dovish monetary policy left unchecked could overheat an economy and result in runaway inflation.
-   The opposite of a dove is a hawk, which is a policy advisor that favors a tight monetary policy to control inflation.
-   Often, the best scenario for a healthy economy is when the people setting monetary policy are capable of switching between a hawkish and dovish stance when the situation calls for it.

## Understanding Dove

Doves prefer low-interest rates as a means of encouraging [[economic growth]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp) because they tend to increase demand for consumer borrowing and spur [[consumer spending]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp). As a result, doves believe the negative effects of low-interest [[rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) are relatively negligible. However, if interest rates are kept low for an indefinite period of time, inflation rises.

Derived from the placid nature of the bird of the same name, the term is the opposite of "[hawk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hawk.asp)." A hawk is, conversely, someone who believes that higher interest rates [[Will|will]] curb inflation. 

This isn't the only instance in [[Economics|economics]] where animals are used as descriptors. [Bull](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) and [bear](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) are also used, where the former refers to a market affected by rising prices, while the latter is typically one when prices are falling.

## Examples of Doves

In the United States, doves tend to be the members of the Federal Reserve who are responsible for setting interest rates, but the term also applies to journalists or politicians who lobby for low rates as well. [[Ben Bernanke]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benbernanke.asp) and [[Janet Yellen]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101613/janet-yellen-background-and-philosophy.asp) were both considered doves for their commitment to low-interest rates. Paul Krugman, an economist and author, is also a dove because of his advocacy for low rates.

But people don't necessarily have to be one or the other. In fact, [Alan Greenspan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alangreenspan.asp), who served as chairman of the Federal Reserve between 1987 and 2006, was said to be fairly hawkish in 1987. But that stance changed over time and he eventually became more dovish, as he navigated the bursting of the Internet bubble of the 1990s, as well as the impact of the attack of September 11, 2001, and other major, world-changing events. Realistically, the people of the United States—investors and non-investors alike—want a Fed chair who can switch between hawk and dove depending on what the situation calls for.

## Doves, Consumer Spending and Inflation

When consumers are in a low-interest rate environment created through a dovish monetary policy, they become more likely to take out [[mortgages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp), car loans, and [[credit cards]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/credit_card_rating.asp). This spurs spending by encouraging people and companies to purchase in the present while rates are low rather than deferring the purchase for the future, when rates might be higher. This flurry of spending affects the entire economy. Increased consumption can help create or support jobs, which is often one of the main concerns of the political system from both a [[Taxation|taxation]] and a happy voter perspective.

Eventually, however, the [[aggregate demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp) leads to increases in [[price levels]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_level.asp). Some of this increase is because employment levels [[Will|will]] rise. When this happens, workers tend to earn relatively higher wages as the [[Supply|supply]] of available workers goes down in a hot economy. So the higher wages get baked into product pricing. Adding to this are macroeconomic factors created by an expanding money and credit supply where the value of the dollar is going down because they are plentiful. This makes the input costs for products dependent on supply chains in another currency more expensive in dollars. Add this all up, and you end up with inflation. Left unchecked, inflation can be as destructive as high [[Unemployment|unemployment]] in a stagnant economy.
