[[Outward Direct Investment (ODI)]]
## What Is an [[Outward Direct Investment (ODI)]]?

An [[Outward Direct Investment (ODI)|outward direct investment (ODI)]] is a business strategy in which a domestic firm expands its operations to a foreign country.

ODI can take many different forms depending on the company. For example, some companies [[Will|will]] make a [[green field investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenfield.asp), which is when a parent company creates a subsidiary in a foreign country. A merger or acquisition can also occur in a foreign country (and so may be considered an outward [[Direct Investment|direct investment]]). Finally, a company may decide to expand an existing foreign facility as part of an ODI strategy. Employing ODI is a natural progression for firms if their domestic markets become saturated and better business opportunities are available abroad.

### Key Takeaways

-   An [[Outward Direct Investment (ODI)|outward direct investment (ODI)]] is a business strategy in which a domestic firm expands its operations to a foreign country.
-   Employing [[Outward Direct Investment (ODI)|outward direct investment (ODI)]] is a natural progression for firms if their domestic markets become saturated and better business opportunities are available abroad.
-   American, European, and Japanese firms have long made extensive investments outside their domestic markets.

ODI is also called outward foreign [[Direct Investment|direct investment]] or direct investment abroad.

## Understanding [[Outward Direct Investment (ODI)]]

The extent of a nation's outward [[Direct Investment|direct investment]] can be seen as an indication that its economy is mature. ODI has been shown to increase a country’s investment competitiveness and has proven to be crucial for long-term, sustainable growth. American, European, and Japanese firms, for example, have long made extensive investments outside their domestic markets.

Because of their more rapid [[Growth Rates|growth rates]], emerging market economies often receive large amounts of ODI, as China has for the past two decades. In 2019, China was the second-largest recipient of [[Foreign Investment|foreign investment]]. But even some emerging market countries have begun to make investments abroad.

In 2015, Chinese overseas investment exceeded [[foreign direct investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdi.asp) (FDI) in China for the first time ever. In 2016, China's ODI peaked: Chinese companies invested over $170 billion overseas. Starting in 2017, ODI began a downtrend that has continued. In 2018, China's inflow of [[Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)|foreign direct investment (FDI)]] exceeded its ODI once again (making the country a net [[Debtor|debtor]] once again.)

It is important to make a distinction between [[Outward Direct Investment (ODI)|outward direct investment (ODI)]] and [[Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)|foreign direct investment (FDI)]]. FDI occurs when a non-resident invests in the [[Shares|shares]] of a resident company. ODI occurs when a resident company invests in a wholly-owned subsidiary or a [[Joint|joint]] venture in a non-resident country as part of a strategy to expand their business.

In 2019, China’s ODI declined 8.2%, to $110.6 billion. In yuan terms, it declined by 6%, to 807.95 billion yuan in 2019. The majority of China's ODI is inflows to rental and commercial services, [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]], distribution, and retail. Starting in 2016, Beijing started tightening its [[capital controls]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_conrol.asp). As a result, many of China's overseas projects have been scaled back. These restrictive measures were intended to curb [[capital flight]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalflight.asp)—when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country. At the same time, the domestic economic downturn in China, primarily due to the lingering impacts of the [[Trade War|trade war]] with the U.S., has also hindered Chinese ODI. Because of sluggish domestic growth, investment in foreign assets became less appealing. Previously, [[Foreign Investment|foreign investment]] by Chinese firms has been a significant driver of global asset prices, mostly as a result of the sale of property and mergers and acquisitions.
