[[The Ins and Outs of Financial Instruments]]
## What Is a Financial Instrument?

Financial instruments are assets that can be traded, or they can also be seen as packages of capital that may be traded. Most types of financial instruments provide efficient flow and transfer of capital all throughout the world's investors. These assets can be cash, a contractual right to deliver or receive cash or another type of financial instrument, or evidence of one's ownership of an entity.

### Key Takeaways

-   A financial instrument is a real or virtual document representing a legal agreement involving any kind of monetary value. 
-   Financial instruments may be divided into two types: cash instruments and [[Derivative|derivative]] instruments.
-   Financial instruments may also be divided according to an asset class, which depends on whether they are [[Debt|debt]]-based or [[Equity|equity]]-based.
-   Foreign exchange instruments comprise a third, unique type of financial instrument.

## Understanding Financial Instruments

Financial instruments can be real or virtual documents representing a legal agreement involving any kind of monetary value. [[Equity]]-based financial instruments represent ownership of an asset. [[Debt]]-based financial instruments represent a [[Loan|loan]] made by an investor to the owner of the asset.

[Foreign exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp) instruments comprise a third, unique type of financial instrument. Different subcategories of each instrument type exist, such as preferred share [[Equity|equity]] and common share equity.

International Accounting Standards (IAS) defines financial instruments as "any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial [[Liability|liability]] or [[Equity|equity]] instrument of another entity."

## Types of Financial Instruments

Financial instruments may be divided into two types: cash instruments and [[Derivative|derivative]] instruments.

### Cash Instruments

-   The values of cash instruments are directly influenced and determined by the markets. These can be securities that are easily transferable.
-   Cash instruments may also be deposits and loans agreed upon by borrowers and [[lenders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp).

### [[Derivative]] Instruments

-   The value and characteristics of [[derivative instruments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) are based on the vehicle’s [[Underlying|underlying]] components, such as assets, interest rates, or indices.
-   An [[Equity|equity]] options contract, for example, is a [[Derivative|derivative]] because it derives its value from the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]]. The option gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the stock at a specified price and by a certain date. As the price of the stock rises and falls, so too does the value of the option although not necessarily by the same percentage.
-   There can be [[over-the-counter (OTC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) derivatives or exchange-traded derivatives. OTC is a market or process whereby securities–that are not [[Listed|listed]] on formal exchanges–are priced and traded.

## Types of Asset Classes of Financial Instruments

Financial instruments may also be divided according to an asset class, which depends on whether they are [[Debt|debt]]-based or [[Equity|equity]]-based.

### [[Debt]]-Based Financial Instruments

Short-term [[Debt|debt]]-based financial instruments last for one year or less. Securities of this kind come in the form of T-bills and commercial paper. Cash of this kind can be deposits and certificates of deposit (CDs).

[Exchange-traded derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) under short-term, [[Debt|debt]]-based financial instruments can be short-term interest rate [[Futures|futures]]. [[OTC derivatives]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052815/what-overthecounter-derivative.asp) are forward rate agreements.

Long-term [[Debt|debt]]-based financial instruments last for more than a year. Under securities, these are bonds. [[Cash Equivalents|Cash equivalents]] are loans. Exchange-traded derivatives are bond [[Futures|futures]] and options on bond futures. OTC derivatives are interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, interest rate options, and exotic derivatives.

### [[Equity]]-Based Financial Instruments

Securities under [[Equity|equity]]-based financial instruments are [[Stocks|stocks]]. Exchange-traded derivatives in this category include [[stock options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp) and equity [[Futures|futures]]. The OTC derivatives are [[Stock|stock]] options and exotic derivatives.

## Special Considerations

There are no securities under foreign exchange. [[Cash Equivalents|Cash equivalents]] come in [[spot foreign exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/forex-spot-rate.asp), which is the current prevailing rate. Exchange-traded derivatives under foreign exchange are currency [[Futures|futures]]. OTC derivatives come in foreign exchange options, outright forwards, and foreign exchange swaps.
