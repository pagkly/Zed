## Understanding [[Liquidated Damages]]

[[Liquidated Damages|Liquidated damages]] are meant as a fair representation of losses in situations where actual damages are difficult to ascertain. In general, liquidated damages are designed to be fair, rather than punitive.

[[Liquidated Damages|Liquidated damages]] may be referred to in a specific contract clause to cover circumstances where a party faces a loss from [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) that do not have a direct monetary [[Correlation|correlation]]. For instance, if a party in a contract were to leak [[supply chain]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp) pricing information that is vital to a business, this could fall under liquidated damages.

A common example is a design phase for a new product that may involve consultation with outside suppliers and consultants in addition to a company's employees. The [[Underlying|underlying]] plans or designs for a product might not have a set [[market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp). This may be true even if the subsequent product is crucial to the progress and growth of a company.

These plans may be deemed to be [[trade secrets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-secret.asp) of the business and highly sensitive. If the plans were exposed by a disgruntled employee or supplier, it could greatly hamper the ability to generate revenue from the release of that product. A company would have to make an estimation in advance of what such losses could cost in order to include this in a [[Liquidated Damages|liquidated damages]] clause of a contract.

## Special Considerations

It is possible that a [[Liquidated Damages|liquidated damages]] clause might not be enforced by the courts. This can occur if the monetary amount of liquidated damages cited in the clause is extraordinarily disproportional to the [[Scope|scope]] of what was affected by the breached contract.

Such limitations prevent a plaintiff from attempting to claim an unsubstantiated exorbitant amount from a defendant. For instance, a plaintiff might not be able to claim [[Liquidated Damages|liquidated damages]] that amount to multiples of its [[gross revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp) if the breach only affected a specific portion of its operations.

The concept of [[Liquidated Damages|liquidated damages]] is framed around compensation related to some harm and injury to the party, rather than a fine imposed on the defendant.

The courts typically require that the parties involved make the most reasonable assessment possible for the [[Liquidated Damages|liquidated damages]] clause at the time the contract is signed. This can provide a sense of understanding and reassurance of what is at stake if that aspect of the contract is breached. A liquidated damages clause can also give the parties involved a basis to negotiate from for an out-of-court settlement.
