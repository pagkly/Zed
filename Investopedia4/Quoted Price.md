[[Quoted Price]]
## What Is a [[Quoted Price]]?

A [[Quoted Price|quoted price]] is the most recent price at which an investment (or any other type of asset) has traded. The quoted price of investments such as [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, commodities, and [[derivatives]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) changes constantly throughout the day as events occur that affect the financial markets and the [[perceived value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perceived-value.asp) of various investments. The quoted price represents the most recent bid and ask prices that buyers and sellers were able to agree on.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Quoted Price|quoted price]] of an investment or asset is the most recent bid and ask prices that buyers and sellers agreed upon.
-   The electronic ticker tape shows the [[Quoted Price|quoted price]] for a [[Stock|stock]], along with the stock symbol, the number of [[Shares|shares]] traded, the price traded at, an indication of an increase or decrease from the last quoted price, and the amount of price change.
-   The bid price represents the highest price a prospective buyer is willing to pay for a [[Security|security]], commodity, or currency.
-   The ask price, also referred to as the [[Offer|offer]] price, represents the price a seller [[Will|will]] accept for an asset or [[Security|security]].
-   The bid-ask spread is the difference between the bid price and the ask price; liquid assets that can be bought and sold easily [[Will|will]] have a small bid-ask spread.

## Understanding a [[Quoted Price]]

The quoted prices of [[Stocks|stocks]] are displayed on an electronic [[ticker tape]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tickertape.asp), which shows up-to-the-minute information on trading price and [[trading volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volumeoftrade.asp). For most major exchanges trading hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST.

The ticker tape shows the [[Stock|stock]] (indicated by a three- or four-letter [[stock symbol]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksymbol.asp) or ticker symbol—e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc. or TGT for Target Corporation), the number of [[Shares|shares]] traded, the price they traded at (in decimal form), whether the [[Quoted Price|quoted price]] represents an increase or decrease from the last quoted price, and the amount of the change in price.

Some of the most prominent exchanges in the world are the [[New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE), the [[Nasdaq]], the [[London Stock Exchange (LSE)]], and the Tokyo [[Stock]] Exchange (TSE).

## [[Quoted Price]] and Bid and Ask Prices

The [[Quoted Price|quoted price]] represents the most up-to-date agreement between buyers and sellers, or the bid and ask prices.

### Bid Price

The [[bid price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bidprice.asp) is an [[Offer|offer]] that an investor, trader or dealer makes in order to purchase a [[Security|security]], commodity, or currency. The bid price is the highest price a prospective buyer is willing to pay to acquire the security or asset. [[Quote]] services and [[Stock|stock]] tickers [[Will|will]] generally display the highest bid price available for the security.

### Ask Price

The bid price is opposed by the [[ask price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ask.asp), which is the amount of money the seller [[Will|will]] accept for an asset or [[Security|security]]. An ask price—also often referred to as the [[Offer|offer]] price—is always higher than the bid price.

The difference between the bid price and the ask price is the [[spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp). The spread indicates the asset's [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) or the ease with which it can be sold. [[Stocks]] that are especially liquid [[Will|will]] have small spreads, often just pennies apart.

When a purchase fills at the bid price, both the bid and the ask may move higher for the next transaction, based on demand. A [[Security|security]]'s [[current price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp) is the last price paid for it, which is usually different from the bid and the ask.

## Special Considerations

For individuals that are [[trading their own portfolios]](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/how-renew-and-adjust-your-[[Portfolio|portfolio]]/), quoted prices are often displayed in a rectangle in an easy-to-spot location on their online trading platform. The bids and asks are constantly moving if the [[Security|security]] is in high demand and trading with a large volume. If the security is not well covered and does not have significant demand, the [[Quoted Price|quoted price]] may not move much up or down over the course of the trading day.

## [[Quoted Price]] and Traders

Many stakeholders follow the quoted prices of [[Stocks|stocks]], including company management, the [[investor relations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investorrelations.asp) team, major investors, and [[retail investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp). Traders, in particular, are constantly watching and predicting a [[Security|security]]’s [[Quoted Price|quoted price]] in order to place bets for their clients or their own accounts. When a trader works for a financial institution, they generally trade with the company's money and credit. Alternatively, a trader may work independently, in which case they would not receive the same salary and bonus as for a larger entity but are able to keep all of the profit.
