[[Hard Inquiry]]
## What Is a [[Hard Inquiry]]?

A [[Hard Inquiry|hard inquiry]] is a type of credit information request that includes your full [[credit report]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp) and deducts points from your [[credit score]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp). These types of inquiries are used by lenders and creditors in deciding whether to [[Grant|grant]] you credit or a [[Loan|loan]], and they [[Will|will]] usually cause a short-lived decrease in your [[Credit Score|credit score]].1 A “hard pull” is another name for a hard inquiry.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Hard Inquiry|hard inquiry]] is required before a [[Lender|lender]] [[Will|will]] extend credit.
-   Hard inquiries [[Will|will]] cause a short-lived decrease in your [[Credit Score|credit score]].
-   Creditors also look at [[Debt|debt]]-to-income ratios and housing expense ratios when making credit decisions.

## Understanding a [[Hard Inquiry]]

A [[Hard Inquiry|hard inquiry]] requests your full [[credit history]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp) and [[Credit Score|credit score]] from a [[credit bureau]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditbureau.asp). The [[Lender|lender]] or [[Creditor|creditor]] making the request has the option to choose the bureau and credit report style that best fit its needs. Most lenders [[Will|will]] rely on one or more of [[the top three credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax]](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/top-three-credit-bureaus/). Some may use other bureaus that can provide deeper analysis or [[credit scoring]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_scoring.asp) based on alternative methodologies.

Any type of hard credit inquiry [[Will|will]] be reported on your credit report, causing a small [[Credit Score|credit score]] decrease. [[Hard inquiries remain on your credit score for two years]](https://www.investopedia.com/how-long-does-negative-information-stay-on-your-credit-report-4769774). If you have many hard inquiries in a short time period, you will see a more dramatic decrease in your credit score and be considered a higher [[Risk|risk]] to lenders.1

Unlike hard inquiries, soft credit inquiries do not affect your [[Credit Score|credit score]], because they don’t provide a [[Creditor|creditor]] with your full credit report.

## Soft Inquiry

There is another type of credit inquiry that can be requested: a [[soft inquiry]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soft-inquiry.asp). It follows slightly different procedures and includes less information than a [[Hard Inquiry|hard inquiry]]. Soft inquiries are not reported on your credit report and have no effect on your [[Credit Score|credit score]]. Examples of soft inquiries include free credit reports that you request yourself, [[prequalification]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prequalification.asp) approvals from lenders, [[Loan|loan]] information requests from credit marketing services, and most background checks made by landlords and employers.2 3 4

## Special Considerations

Some creditors place greater emphasis on credit scores than others, with [[qualifying ratios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifying_ratios.asp) also serving as a component in credit [[underwriting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp). Generally, your credit report is only half of the information needed for an underwriting approval. Creditors [[Will|will]] also analyze your [[debt-to-income ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp), which is the primary qualifying ratio for most loans.

Creditors have customized technology and underwriting processes that generate [[Loan|loan]] approvals based on both credit reports and qualifying ratios. Personal loans and credit cards usually do not have a stated minimum [[Credit Score|credit score]], though mortgage lenders generally do set minimums.5 6

As for qualifying ratios, most creditors follow what is known as the “[28/36 rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/twenty-eight-thirty-six-rule.asp).” For standard loans, for instance, a [[Creditor|creditor]] [[Will|will]] usually require a [[Debt|debt]]-to-income ratio of 36% or less—your household spends 36% or less of your monthly [[Gross Income|gross income]] on debt repayment. [[For mortgage loans, creditors will also]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/081715/how-improve-your-chance-getting-mortgage.asp) analyze your [[housing expense ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_expense_ratio.asp), which must typically be approximately 28% or less for [[Loan|loan]] approval.7 8
