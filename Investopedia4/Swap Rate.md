[[Swap Rate]]
## What Is a [[Swap Rate]]?

A [[Swap Rate|swap rate]] is the rate of the fixed leg of a [[Swap|swap]] as determined by its particular market and the parties involved. In an [[interest rate swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp), it is the [[fixed interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp) exchanged for a benchmark rate such as [[LIBOR]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) or the [[Fed Funds Rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fed-funds-[[Futures|futures]].asp) plus or minus a spread. It is also the [[exchange rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/090314/how-calculate-exchange-rate.asp) associated with the fixed portion of a [[currency swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/introduction-currency-swaps.asp).

-   [[Swap Rate|Swap rate]] denotes the fixed rate that a party to a [[Swap|swap]] contract requests in exchange for the obligation to pay a short-term rate, such as the Labor or Federal Funds rate.
-   When the [[Swap|swap]] is entered, the fixed rate [[Will|will]] be equal to the value of floating-rate payments, calculated from the agreed counter-value.
-   Swaps are typically quoted in a [[Swap|swap]] spread, which calculates the difference between the [[Swap Rate|swap rate]] and counter-party rate.

## How Does the [[Swap Rate]] Work?

[[Swap]] rates are applied to different types of swaps. An interest rate swap refers to the exchange of a floating interest rate for a fixed interest rate. A currency swap refers to the exchange of interest payments in one currency for those in another currency. In both types of transactions, the fixed element is referred to as the [[Swap Rate|swap rate]].

## What Does an Interest Rate [[Swap]] Tell You?

In an interest rate [[Swap|swap]], one party [[Will|will]] be the payer and the other will be the recipient of the fixed rate. The [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] of the fixed-rate leg of the swap is set when the trade is undertaken. The cash flow for the floating rate leg is set periodically on the rate [[reset dates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reset-date.asp), which are determined by the reset period of the floating rate leg.

The most common index for the floating rate leg is the three-month Libor. This can either be paid quarterly or compounded and paid semi-annually. The rate above or below the chosen Libor reflects the [[yield curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldcurve.asp) and [credit spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditspread.asp) to be charged.

Interest rate payments between fixed and floating rate legs are netted at the end of each payment period and only the difference is exchanged.

## What Does a Currency [[Swap]] Tell You?

There are three types of interest rate exchanges for a currency [[Swap|swap]]:

1.  The fixed rate of one currency for the fixed rate of the second currency.
2.  The fixed rate of one currency for the floating rate of the second currency.
3.  The floating rate of one currency for the floating rate of the second currency.

The [[Swap|swap]] can include or exclude a full exchange of the [[principal amount]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) of the currency at both the beginning and the end of the swap. The interest rate payments are not netted because they are calculated and paid in different currencies. Regardless of whether or not the principal is exchanged, a [[Swap Rate|swap rate]] for the conversion of the principal must be set.

If there is no exchange of [[Principal|principal]], then the [[Swap Rate|swap rate]] is simply used for the calculation of the two notional principal currency amounts on which the interest rate payments are based. If there is an exchange, where the [[Swap|swap]] rate is set can have a financial impact since the exchange rate can change between the start of the agreement and its conclusion.
