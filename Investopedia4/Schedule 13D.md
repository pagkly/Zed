[[Schedule 13D]]
## What Is [[Schedule 13D]]?

[[Schedule 13D]] is a form that must be filed with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) when a person or group acquires more than 5% of any class of a company's [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) [[Shares|shares]]. There are several pieces of relevant information that must be disclosed within 10 days of the transaction. Schedule 13D is also known as a "beneficial ownership report."

### Key Takeaways

-   When a person or group acquires 5% or more of a company's [[Shares|shares]], they must report it to the Securities and Exchange [[Commission]].
-   Among the questions [[Schedule 13D]] asks is the purpose of the transaction, such as a takeover or merger.
-   If the beneficial owner's [[Holdings|holdings]] change by 1% or more, they must amend their [[Schedule 13D]].

## Understanding [[Schedule 13D]]

Investors may decide to buy a large number of [[Shares|shares]] in a publicly-held company for a variety of reasons. For example, they could be [[activist investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activist-investor.asp) attempting a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]], institutional investors who believe the [[Stock|stock]] is undervalued, or a dissident investor contemplating a [[proxy contest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxyfight.asp) with the goal of controlling the voting or replacing management.

When a person or group of persons acquire a significant ownership stake in a company, characterized as more than 5% of a voting [[class]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/class.asp) of its publicly traded securities, the SEC requires that they disclose the purchase on a [[Schedule 13D]] form. In some cases, they may be able to use a simpler form, called the [[Schedule 13G]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp).

Once the disclosure has been filed with the SEC, the public company and the exchange(s) on which the company trades are notified of the new [[beneficial owner]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficialowner.asp). [[Schedule 13D]] is intended to provide transparency to the public regarding who these shareholders are and why they have taken a significant stake in the company. The form signifies to the public that a change of control, such as a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]] or proxy fight, might be about to take place so that current shareholders in the company can make informed investing and voting decisions.

The obligation to file [[Schedule 13D]] lies with the new beneficial owner. This is because the [[target company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/targetfirm.asp) might not know the person or group behind the transaction. The beneficial owner must file Schedule 13D within 10 days following the purchase of the [[Shares|shares]].1

## Requirements for [[Schedule 13D]]

[[Schedule 13D]] requires that the beneficial owner provide relevant information about several items, which include the following:

**Item 1: [[Security]] and Issuer.** This section asks about the type of securities purchased and the name and address of the company that issued them.

**Item 2: Identity and Background.** In this section, the buyers identify themselves, including their type of business, citizenship, and any criminal convictions or involvement in civil suits within the past five years.

**Item 3: Source and Amount of Funds or Other Considerations.** This section notes where the money is coming from, including whether any of it was borrowed.

**Item 4: Purpose of Transaction.** This section of [[Schedule 13D]] alerts investors to any change of control that might be looming. Among other disclosures, beneficial owners must indicate whether they have plans involving a merger, reorganization, or liquidation of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries.

**Item 5: Interest in Securities of the Issuer.** Here the beneficial owner lists the number of [[Shares|shares]] being purchased and the percentage of the company's [[outstanding shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) that this purchase represents.

**Item 6: Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings, or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.** The beneficial owner should describe any agreement or relationship they have with any person regarding the target company’s securities. For example, that might involve voting rights, finder's fees, [[Joint|joint]] ventures, or loans or option arrangements.

**Item 7: Material to be Filed as Exhibits.** These include copies of any written agreements the beneficial owner has entered into with regard to the securities.

## Special Considerations: Disclosure of Material Changes

If there are any material changes to the information filed in [[Schedule 13D]], the beneficial owners must amend their Schedule 13D within two days. A material change includes any increase or decrease of at least 1% in the percentage of the class of securities held by the beneficial owner.

Most [[Schedule 13D]] filings are available for viewing in the SEC's [[EDGAR database]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/edgar.asp). The database presents Form 13D as “SC 13D–General statement of acquisition of beneficial ownership.” Any amended form is denoted as SC 13D/A.

## Real World Example of [[Schedule 13D]]

The media conglomerate, called IAC/InterActiveCorp ([IAC](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=IAC)), purchased a significant amount of [[Equity|equity]] [[Shares|shares]] in MGM Resorts International ([MGM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=mgm)). The resulting 13D was filed on August 20, 2020, with the SEC.2

Below is a portion of the 13D filing for MGM:

-   IAC/InterActiveCorp is named as the reporting person (section 1).
-   The number of [[Shares|shares]] purchased was 59,033,902 (section 7).
-   The purchase represented a 12% ownership in MGM, based on the outstanding [[Shares|shares]] at the time (section 13).
