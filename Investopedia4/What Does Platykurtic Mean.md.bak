[[What Does Platykurtic Mean]]?
## [[What Does Platykurtic Mean]]?

The term "platykurtic" refers to a [[statistical distribution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probabilitydistribution.asp) in which the [[excess kurtosis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/excesskurtosis.asp) value is negative. For this reason, a platykurtic distribution [[Will|will]] have thinner tails than a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]], resulting in fewer extreme positive or negative events. The opposite of a platykurtic distribution is a [[leptokurtic distribution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leptokurtic.asp), in which excess [[Kurtosis|kurtosis]] is positive.

Investors [[Will|will]] consider which statistical distributions are associated with different types of investments when deciding where to invest. More [[risk-averse]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskaverse.asp) investors might prefer assets and markets with platykurtic distributions because those assets are less likely to produce extreme results.

### Key Takeaways

-   Platykurtic distributions are those with negative excess [[Kurtosis|kurtosis]].
-   They have a lower likelihood of extreme events as compared to a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]].
-   [[Risk]]-averse investors can focus on investments whose returns follow a platykurtic distribution, to minimize the risk of large negative events.

## Understanding Platykurtic Distributions

There are three basic kinds of statistical distributions: leptokurtic, [[mesokurtic]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mesokurtic.asp), and platykurtic. These distributions differ depending on their amount of excess [[Kurtosis|kurtosis]], which relates to the probability of extreme positive or negative events. The [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]], which is a type of mesokurtic distribution, has a [[kurtosis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kurtosis.asp) of three. Therefore, distributions with kurtosis greater than three are said to have "positive excess kurtosis," while those with kurtosis of less than three are said to have "negative excess kurtosis."

While mesokurtic distributions have [[Kurtosis|kurtosis]] of three, leptokurtic and platykurtic distributions have positive and negative excess kurtosis, respectively. Therefore, leptokurtic distributions have a relatively high probability of extreme events, whereas the opposite is true for platykurtic distributions.

The following figures show charts of these three types of distributions, all with the same [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]]. Although the figure on the left does not reveal much of the differences between these distributions' tails, the figure on the right gives a clearer view by plotting the quantiles of the distributions against each-other. This technique is known as a quantile-quantile plot, or "Q-Q" for short.

## Special Considerations

Most investors believe that [[equity market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equitymarket.asp) returns more closely resemble a leptokurtic distribution than a platykurtic one. That is, while most returns are likely to be similar to the average [[Return|return]] for the market as a whole, returns [[Will|will]] occasionally deviate widely from the mean. These dramatic and unpredictable events, sometimes referred to as "[black swans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp)," are less likely to occur in markets that are platykurtic.

For this reason, more cautious investors might avoid investing in leptokurtic markets and focus on investments [[Offering|offering]] platykurtic returns. On the other hand, some investors deliberately pursue investments with leptokurtic returns, believing that their extreme positive returns [[Will|will]] more than compensate for their extreme negative returns.

## Real World Example of a Platykurtic Distribution

In 2011, Morningstar published a [[research paper](http://morningstardirect.morningstar.com/clientcomm/iss/Tsai_Real_World_Not_Normal.pdf) that featured information on the excess kurtosis levels of different types of assets, as observed between Feb. 1994 and June 2011. The list included a wide range of investments, from U.S. and international equities to [real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp), [[commodities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), cash, and [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp).

The levels of excess [[Kurtosis|kurtosis]] were similarly varied. On the low end of the spectrum were cash and international bonds, which had excess kurtosis of -1.43 and 0.58, respectively. On the other end of the spectrum were U.S. high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds and [[hedge-fund arbitrage strategies]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-[[Hedge|hedge]]-funds.asp), [[Offering|offering]] excess kurtosis of 9.33 and 22.59.

Asset classes with intermediate levels of excess [[Kurtosis|kurtosis]] included international real [[Estate|estate]] (2.61), equities from international emerging economies (1.98), and commodities (2.29).

An investor looking at this data could quickly discern what kinds of assets they wish to invest in, given their tolerance for potential black swan events. [[Risk]]-averse investors who want to minimize the likelihood of extreme events could focus on low-[[Kurtosis|kurtosis]] investments, while investors more comfortable with extreme events could focus on high-kurtosis ones.
