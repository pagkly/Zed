[[Speculation]]
## What is [[Speculation]]?

In the world of [[Finance|finance]], [[Speculation|speculation]], or speculative trading, refers to the act of conducting a financial transaction that has substantial [[Risk|risk]] of losing value but also holds the expectation of a significant [[Gain|gain]] or other major value. With speculation, the risk of loss is more than offset by the possibility of a substantial gain or other recompense.

An investor who purchases a speculative investment is likely focused on price fluctuations. While the [[Risk|risk]] associated with the investment is high, the investor is typically more concerned about generating a profit based on market value changes for that investment than on long-term investing. When speculative investing involves the purchase of a foreign currency, it is known as currency [[Speculation|speculation]]. In this scenario, an investor buys a currency in an effort to later sell that currency at an appreciated rate, as opposed to an investor who buys a currency in order to pay for an import or to [[Finance|finance]] a [[Foreign Investment|foreign investment]].

Without the prospect of substantial gains, there would be little motivation to engage in [[Speculation|speculation]]. It may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between speculation and simple investment, forcing the market player to consider whether speculation or investment depends on factors that measure the nature of the asset, expected duration of the holding period and/or amount of [[Leverage|leverage]] applied to the exposure.

## How Does [[Speculation]] Work?

For example, real [[Estate|estate]] can blur the line between investment and [[Speculation|speculation]] when buying property with the intention of renting it out. While this would qualify as investing, buying multiple condominiums with minimal down payments for the purpose of reselling them quickly at a profit would undoubtedly be regarded as speculation.

Speculators can provide market [[Liquidity|liquidity]] and narrow the [[bid-ask spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp), enabling producers to [[Hedge|hedge]] price [[Risk|risk]] efficiently. Speculative short-selling may also keep rampant bullishness in check and prevent the formation of asset price bubbles through betting against successful outcomes.

Mutual funds and [[Hedge|hedge]] funds often engage in [[Speculation|speculation]] in the foreign exchange markets as well as bond and [[Stock|stock]] markets.

## [[Speculation]] and the Forex Market

Forex markets execute the world's highest total volume and dollar value, with an estimated $6.6 trillion per day changing hands between buyers and sellers.1 This market trades around the world for 24 hours a day while positions can be taken and reversed in seconds, utilizing high-speed electronic trading platforms.

Transactions typically feature spot deals to buy and sell currency pairs, such as [[EUR]]/USD (Euro-US Dollar), for delivery through options or simple exchange. This market is dominated by asset managers and [[Hedge|hedge]] funds with multi-billion-dollar portfolios. [[Speculation]] in the forex markets can be hard to differentiate from typical hedging practices, which occur when a company or financial institution buys or sells a currency to hedge against market movements.

For example, a sale of foreign currency related to a bond purchase can be deemed either a [[Hedge|hedge]] of the bond's value or common [[Speculation|speculation]]. These relationships can get complicated to define if the currency position is bought and sold multiple times while the fund owns the [[Underlying|underlying]] bond.

## [[Speculation]] and the Bond Market

The [[Global Bond|global bond]] market is valued at over $100 trillion, of which approximately $40 trillion is based in the United States, and these assets may include [[Debt|debt]] issued by governments and multinational corporations.2 Asset prices can fluctuate greatly and are strongly influenced by interest rate movement as well as political and economic uncertainties. The largest single world market trades U.S. Treasuries, with prices in that venue often driven by common [[Speculation|speculation]].
