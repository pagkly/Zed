## Understanding Operations Management

Operations management involves utilizing resources from staff, materials, equipment, and technology. Operations managers acquire, develop, and deliver goods to clients based on client needs and the abilities of the company.

Operations management handles various strategic issues, including determining the size of [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] plants and [[Project Management|project management]] methods and implementing the structure of information technology networks. Other operational issues include the management of inventory levels, including work-in-process levels and raw materials acquisition, quality control, materials handling, and maintenance policies.

Operations management entails studying the use of raw materials and ensuring minimal waste occurs. Operations managers utilize numerous formulas, such as the [[economic order quantity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicorderquantity.asp) formula to determine when and how large of an inventory order to process and how much inventory to [[Hold|hold]] on hand.

The combination of understanding and coordinating the work of a company are central to becoming a successful operations manager.

## Special Considerations

A critical function of operations management relates to the management of inventory through the [[Supply|supply]] chain. To be an effective operations management professional, one must be able to understand the processes that are essential to what a company does and get them to flow and work together seamlessly. The coordination involved in setting up business processes in an efficient way requires a solid understanding of logistics.Â 

An operations management professional understands local and global trends, customer demand and the available resources for production. Operations management approaches the acquisition of materials and the use of labor in a timely, cost-effective manner to deliver customer expectations. Inventory levels are monitored to ensure excessive quantities are on hand. Operations management is responsible for finding vendors that [[Supply|supply]] the appropriate goods at reasonable prices and have the ability to deliver the product when needed.

Another large facet of operations management involves the delivery of goods to customers. This includes ensuring products are delivered within the agreed time commitment. Operations management also typically follows up with customers to ensure the products meet quality and functionality needs. Finally, operations management takes the feedback received and distributes the relevant information to each department to use in process improvement.

Operations managers are involved in coordinating and developing new processes while reevaluating current structures. Organization and [[productivity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Productivity|productivity]].asp) are two key drivers of being an operations manager, and the work often requires versatility and innovation.

An MBA in operations management can give someone a global perspective on industry trends and an awareness of any financial regulations and political uncertainties that can affect an organization. It also gives someone a solid grasp on the inherent complexities and the tools needed to respond well to change.
