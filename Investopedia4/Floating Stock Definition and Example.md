[[Floating Stock Definition and Example]]
## What Is Floating [[Stock]]?

Floating [[Stock|stock]] is the number of [[Shares|shares]] available for trading of a particular stock. Low float [[Stocks|stocks]] are those with a low number of shares. Floating stock is calculated by subtracting closely-held shares and [[restricted stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp) from a firm’s total outstanding shares.

Closely-held [[Shares|shares]] are those owned by insiders, major shareholders, and employees. [[Restricted Stock|Restricted stock]] refers to insider shares that cannot be traded because of a temporary restriction, such as the lock-up period after an [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO).

A [[Stock|stock]] with a small float [[Will|will]] generally be more volatile than a stock with a large float. This is because, with fewer [[Shares|shares]] available, it may be harder to find a buyer or seller. This results in larger [[spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp) and often lower volume.

### Key Takeaways

-   Floating [[Stock|stock]] refers to the number of [[Shares|shares]] a company has available to trade in the open market.
-   To calculate a company's floating [[Stock|stock]], subtract its [[Restricted Stock|restricted stock]] and closely held [[Shares|shares]] from its total number of outstanding shares.
-   Floating [[Stock|stock]] [[Will|will]] change over time as new [[Shares|shares]] may be issued, shares may be bought back, or insiders or major shareholders may buy or sell the stock.
-   Low float [[Stocks|stocks]] tend to have higher spreads and higher [[Volatility|volatility]] than a comparable larger float [[Stock|stock]].
-   Investors can find it difficult to enter or exit positions in [[Stocks|stocks]] that have a low float.

## Understanding Floating [[Stock]]

A company may have a large number of [[shares outstanding]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp), but limited floating [[Stock|stock]]. For example, assume a company has 50 million [[Shares|shares]] outstanding. Of that 50 million shares, large institutions own 35 million shares, management and insiders own 5 million, and the [[employee stock ownership plan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/esop.asp) (ESOP) holds 2 million shares. Floating stock is therefore only 8 million shares (50 million shares minus 42 million shares), or 16% of the outstanding shares.

The amount of a company’s floating [[Stock|stock]] may rise or fall over time. This can occur for a variety of reasons. For example, a company may sell additional [[Shares|shares]] to raise more capital, which then increases the floating stock. If restricted or closely-held shares become available, then the floating stock [[Will|will]] also increase.

On the flip side, if a company decides to implement a [[share buyback]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp), then the number of outstanding [[Shares|shares]] [[Will|will]] decrease. In this case, the floating shares as a percentage of outstanding [[Stock|stock]] will also go down. 

## Why Floating [[Stock]] Is Important

A company's float is an important number for investors because it indicates how many [[Shares|shares]] are actually available to be bought and sold by the general investing public. Low float is typically an impediment to active trading. This lack of trading activity can make it difficult for investors to enter or exit positions in [[Stocks|stocks]] that have limited float.

Institutional investors [[Will|will]] often avoid trading in companies with smaller floats because there are fewer [[Shares|shares]] to trade, thus leading to limited [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) and wider [[bid-ask spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp). Instead, institutional investors (such as mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies) that buy large blocks of [[Stock|stock]] will look to invest in companies with a larger float. If they invest in companies with a big float, their large purchases will not impact the share price as much.

## Special Considerations

A company is not responsible for how [[Shares|shares]] within the float are traded by the public—this is a function of the [secondary market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp). Therefore, shares that are purchased, sold, or even shorted by investors do not affect the float because these actions do not represent a change in the number of shares available for trade. They simply represent a redistribution of shares. Similarly, the creation and [[trading of options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) on a [[Stock|stock]] do not affect the float.

## Example of Floating [[Stock]]

As of June 2020, General Electric (GE) had 8.75 billion [[Shares|shares]] outstanding.1 Of this, 0.13% were held by insiders. 63.61% were held by large institutions.2 Therefore, a total of 63.7% or 5.57 billion shares were likely not available for public trading. The floating [[Stock|stock]] is therefore 3.18 billion shares (8.75 - 5.57).

It is important to note that institutions don't [[Hold|hold]] a [[Stock|stock]] forever. The [[institutional ownership]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutional-ownership.asp) number [[Will|will]] change regularly, although not always by a significant percentage. Falling institutional ownership coupled with a falling share price could signal that institutions are [[Dumping|dumping]] the [[Shares|shares]]. Increasing institutional ownership shows that institutions are accumulating shares.
