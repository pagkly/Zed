## What [[Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF)]] Can Tell You

Levered free [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] is a measure of a company's ability to expand its business and to pay returns to shareholders (dividends or buybacks) via the money generated through operations. It may also be used as an indicator of a company's ability to obtain additional capital through financing.

If a company already has a significant amount of [[Debt|debt]] and has little in the way of a cash cushion after meeting its obligations, it may be difficult for the company to obtain additional financing from a [[Lender|lender]]. If, however, a company has a healthy amount of levered free [[Cash Flow|cash flow]], it then becomes a more attractive investment and a low-[[Risk|risk]] borrower.

Even if a company's levered free [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] is negative, it does not necessarily indicate that the company is failing. It may be the case that the company has made substantial [[capital investments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-investment.asp) that have yet to start paying off.

As long as the company is able to secure the necessary cash to survive until its [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] increases a temporary period of negative levered free cash flow is both survivable and acceptable.

What a company chooses to do with its levered free [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] is also important to investors. A company may choose to devote a substantial amount of its levered free cash flow to dividend payments or for investment in the company. If, on the other hand, the company's management perceives an important opportunity for growth and market expansion, it may choose to devote nearly all of its levered free cash flow to funding potential growth.

## The Difference Between LFCF and Unlevered Free [[Cash Flow]] (UFCF)

Levered free [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] is the amount of cash a business has after paying debts and other obligations. Unlevered free cash flow is the amount of cash a company has prior to paying its bills. UFCF is calculated as EBITDA minus CapEx minus [[working capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp) minus taxes.

LFCF is the [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] available to pay shareholders, while UFCF is the money available to pay shareholders and debtholders. Levered free cash flow is considered the more important figure for investors to watch as it's a better indicator of a company's profitability.
