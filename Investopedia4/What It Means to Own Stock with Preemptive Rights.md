[[What It Means to Own Stock with Preemptive Rights]]
## What Are Preemptive Rights?

Preemptive rights are a contractual clause giving a shareholder the right to buy additional [[Shares|shares]] in any future issue of the company's [[Common Stock|common stock]] before the shares are available to the general public. Shareholders who have such a clause are generally [[early investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/6-lessons-top-6-investors.asp) or majority owners who want to maintain the size of their stake in the company when and if additional shares are offered.

A preemptive right is sometimes called an "anti-dilution provision." It gives the investor the option of maintaining a certain percentage of ownership of the company as it grows.

### Key Takeaways

-   A preemptive right allows an early investor to maintain voting clout in a company even if new [[Shares|shares]] are issued.
-   The right can also protect the early investor from a loss if the new [[Shares|shares]] are priced lower than the initial shares.
-   Preemptive rights are routinely offered only to early investors and majority shareholders, not to all shareholders.

In addition, the preemptive right may protect the investor from a loss if the new round of [[common stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/101614/what-you-need-know-about-preferred-[[Stock|stock]].asp) is issued at a lower price than the [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] owned by the investor. In this case, the owner of preferred stock has the right to convert the [[Shares|shares]] to a larger number of common shares, offsetting the loss in share value.

## Understanding the Preemptive Right

The preemptive right clause is commonly used as an incentive to early investors in [[Return|return]] for the [[Risk|risk]] taken in financing a new venture.

This right is not routinely granted to all shareholders. Several states [[Grant|grant]] preemptive rights as a matter of law but even these laws give the company the ability to negate that right in its articles of incorporation.

A preemptive right is essentially a [[Right Of First Refusal|right of first refusal]]. The shareholder may exercise the option to buy additional [[Shares|shares]] but is under no obligation to do so.

### The Benefit to Shareholders

Preemptive rightsÂ protect a shareholder from losing voting power as more [[Shares|shares]] are issued and the company's ownership becomes [[diluted]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp).

Since the shareholder is getting an insider's price for [[Shares|shares]] in the [[New Issue|new issue]], there also can be a strong profit incentive.

At the very least, there is the option of converting [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] to more [[Shares|shares]] if the [[New Issue|new issue]] is priced lower.

### The Benefit to Companies

It is less expensive for a company to sell [[Shares|shares]] to current shareholders in a new [[Offering|offering]] than to sell shares to the general public, as the company would not need to pay for investment banking services.

These savings would lower the company's [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]], and hence its [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]], increasing the firm's value.

Preemptive rights also are an incentive for companies to perform well so they can issue a new round of [[Stock|stock]] at a higher valuation when necessary.

The preemptive right offers the shareholder an option but not an obligation to buy additional [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock|stock]].

## Example of Preemptive Rights

Let's assume that a company's [[initial public offering (IPO)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) consists of 100 [[Shares|shares]] and an individual purchases 10 of the shares. That's a 10% [[Equity|equity]] interest in the company.

Down the road, the company makes a secondary [[Offering|offering]] of 500 additional [[Shares|shares]]. The shareholder who holds a preemptive right must be given the opportunity to purchase as many as 50 shares, or 10%, of the new offering. The investor can exercise that right and maintain a 10% [[Equity|equity]] interest in the company.

If the investor decides not to exercise the preemptive right, the company [[Will|will]] sell the [[Shares|shares]] to other parties and the early shareholder's ownership percentage in the business will decline.
