[[Classical Economics]]
## What Is [[Classical Economics]]?

[[Classical Economics|Classical economics]] is a broad term that refers to the dominant school of thought for [[economics]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Economics|economics]].asp) in the 18th and 19th centuries. Most consider Scottish economist [Adam Smith](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-economics/) the progenitor of classical economic theory. However, Spanish scholastics and French physiocrats made earlier contributions. Other notable contributors to classical economics include [[David Ricardo]], [Thomas Malthus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thomas-malthus.asp), Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, [[John Stuart Mill]], Jean-Baptiste Say, and Eugen Böhm von Bawerk.

### Key Takeaways

-   Classical economic theory helped countries to migrate from monarchic rule to capitalistic democracies with self-regulation.
-   Adam Smith’s 1776 release of the _Wealth of Nations_ highlights some of the most prominent developments in [[Classical Economics|classical economics]].
-   Theories to explain value, price, [[Supply|supply]], demand, and distribution, was the focus of [[Classical Economics|classical economics]].
-   [[Classical Economics|Classical economics]] was eventually replaced with more updated ideas, such as Keynesian [[Economics|economics]], which called for more government intervention.

## Understanding [[Classical Economics]]

Self-regulating democracies and capitalistic market developments form the basis for [[Classical Economics|classical economics]]. Before the rise of classical [[Economics|economics]], most national economies followed a top-down, command-and-control, monarchic government policy system. Many of the most famous classical thinkers, including Smith and Turgot, developed their theories as alternatives to the [protectionist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Protectionism|protectionism]].asp) and inflationary policies of [mercantilist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[Mercantilism|mercantilism]].asp) Europe. Classical economics became closely associated with economic, and later political, freedom.

## The Rise of [[Classical Economics]]

Classical economic theory was developed shortly after the birth of western [capitalism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Capitalism|capitalism]].asp) and the [[Industrial Revolution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrial-revolution.asp). Classical economists provided the best early attempts at explaining capitalism's inner workings. The earliest classical economists developed theories of value, price, [[Supply|supply]], demand, and distribution. Nearly all rejected government interference with market exchanges, preferring a looser market strategy known as [[laissez-faire]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp), or "let it be."

Classical thinkers were not completely unified in their beliefs or understanding of markets although there were notable common themes in most classical literature. The majority favored [free trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free-trade.asp) and competition among workers and businesses. Classical economists wanted to transition away from class-based social structures in favor of meritocracies.

## The Decline of [[Classical Economics]]

The [[Classical Economics|classical economics]] of Adam Smith had drastically evolved and changed by the 1880s and 1890s, but its core remained intact. By that time, the writings of German philosopher [Karl Marx](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/karl-marx.asp) had emerged to challenge the policy prescriptions of the classical school. However, Marxian [[Economics|economics]] made very few lasting contributions to economic theory.

A more thorough challenge to classical theory emerged in the 1930s and 1940s through the writings of British mathematician [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp). Keynes was a student of Alfred Marshall and admirer of [[Thomas Malthus]]. Keynes thought that free-market economies tended toward underconsumption and underspending. He called this the crucial economic problem and used it to criticize high-interest rates and individual preferences for saving. Keynes also refuted [Say's Law of Markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/says-law.asp).

[Keynesian economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp) advocated for a more controlling role for central governments in economic affairs, which made Keynes popular with British and American politicians. After the [Great Depression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp) and World War II, Keynesianism had replaced classical and [[Define Neoclassical Economics|neoclassical economics]] as the dominant intellectual paradigm among world governments.

## Real World Example

Adam Smith’s 1776 release of the _Wealth of Nations_ highlights some of the most prominent developments in [[Classical Economics|classical economics]]. His revelations centered around free trade and a concept called the "[invisible hand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblehand.asp)" which served as the theory for the beginning stages of domestic and international [[Supply|supply]] and demand.

This theory, the dual and competing forces of demand-side and [[Sell-Side|sell-side]], moves the market to price and production equilibrium. Smith’s studies helped promote domestic trade and led to more efficient and rational pricing in the product markets based on [[supply and demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-[[Supply|supply]]-demand.asp).
