Recapitalization: The Ins and Outs
## What Is Recapitalization?

Recapitalization is the process of restructuring a company's [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] mixture, often to stabilize a company's capital structure. The process mainly involves the exchange of one form of financing for another, such as removing [[preferred shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preference-[[Shares|shares]].asp) from the company's capital structure and replacing them with [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp).

### Key Takeaways:

-   Recapitalization is the restructuring of a company's [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] ratio.
-   The purpose of recapitalization is to stabilize a company's capital structure.
-   Some of the reasons a company may consider recapitalization include a drop in its share price, to defend against a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]], or bankruptcy.

## Understanding Recapitalization

Recapitalization is a strategy a company can use to improve its financial stability or overhaul its [[Financial Structure|financial structure]]. To accomplish this, the company must change its [[debt-to-equity ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp) by adding more [[Debt|debt]] or more [[Equity|equity]] to its [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp). There are many reasons why a company may consider recapitalization including:

-   A fall in share price
-   To protect itself against a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]]
-   To reduce financial obligations and minimize taxes
-   To provide [[venture capitalists]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp) with an exit strategy
-   [[Bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp)

When a company's [[Debt|debt]] decreases in proportion to its [[Equity|equity]], it has less [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp). Its [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS) should decrease following the change. But its [[Shares|shares]] would be incrementally less risky since the company has fewer debt obligations, which require interest payments and [[Return|return]] of [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) upon maturity. Without the requirements of debt, the company can return more of its profits and cash to shareholders.

### Reasons to Consider Recapitalization

Several factors motivate a company to recapitalize. A company may decide to use it as a strategy to defend itself against a [[hostile takeover]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hostiletakeover.asp). The target company's management may decide to issue more [[Debt|debt]] to make it less attractive to the potential acquirer.

Another reason may be to reduce its financial obligations. Higher [[Debt|debt]] levels compared to [[Equity|equity]] means higher interest payments. By [[trading in debt for equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/debtequityswap.asp), the company can reduce the level of debt and, therefore, the amount of interest it pays to its creditors. This, in turn, improves the company's overall financial wellbeing.

Furthermore, recapitalization is a viable strategy to help keep share prices from dropping. If a company finds that its [[Shares|shares]] are declining in value, it may decide to [[Swap|swap]] [[Equity|equity]] for [[Debt|debt]] to push the [[Stock|stock]] price back up.

Some companies may also use recapitalization to minimize their tax payments, implement an [[exit strategy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exitstrategy.asp) for venture capitalists, or reorganize themselves during a bankruptcy. Companies often use this as a way to diversify their [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] ratio to improve [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp).

### Types of Recapitalization

Companies can [[Swap|swap]] [[Debt|debt]] for [[Equity|equity]] or vice versa for many reasons. An example of equity replacing debt in the capital structure is when a company issues [[Stock|stock]] to buy back [[debt securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtsecurity.asp), increasing its proportion of equity capital compared to its debt capital. This is called an equity recapitalization.

[[Debt]] investors require routine payments and a [[Return|return]] of [[Principal|principal]] upon maturity, so a [[Swap|swap]] of debt for [[Equity|equity]] helps a company maintain its cash and use the cash generated from operations for business purposes, [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]], or capital returns to equity holders.

On the other hand, a company may issue [[Debt|debt]] and use the cash to buy back [[Shares|shares]] or issue [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp), effectively recapitalizing the company by increasing the proportion of debt in the capital structure. Another benefit of taking on more debt is that interest payments are tax-deductible while dividends are not. By paying interest on debt securities, a company can decrease its tax bill and increase the amount of capital returned in total to both debt and [[Equity|equity]] investors.

Governments may buy back [[Shares|shares]] to get a controlling interest in a company important to a nation's economy through nationalizationâ€”another form of recapitalization.

Governments also partake in the mass recapitalization of their countries' banking sectors during times of [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] and when the solvency and [[Liquidity|liquidity]] of banks and the greater financial system come into question. For example, the U.S. government recapitalized the country's banking sector with various forms of [[Equity|equity]] to keep the banks and the financial system solvent and maintain liquidity through the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/troubled-asset-relief-program-tarp.asp) (TARP) in 2008.1
