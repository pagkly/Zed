[[Understanding the Certainty Equivalent]]
## What Is the Certainty Equivalent?

The certainty equivalent is a guaranteed [[Return|return]] that someone would accept now, rather than taking a chance on a higher, but uncertain, return in the future. Put another way, the certainty equivalent is the guaranteed amount of cash that a person would consider as having the same amount of desirability as a risky asset.

-   The certainty equivalent represents the amount of guaranteed money an investor would accept now instead of taking a [[Risk|risk]] of getting more money at a future date.
-   The certainty equivalent varies between investors based on their [[Risk|risk]] tolerance, and a retiree would have a higher certainty equivalent because they're less willing to risk their retirement funds.
-   The certainty equivalent is closely related to the concept of [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] or the amount of additional [[Return|return]] an investor requires to choose a risky investment over a safer investment.

## What Does the Certainty Equivalent Tell You?

Investments must pay a [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] to compensate investors for the possibility that they may not get their money back and the higher the risk, the higher premium an investor expects over the average [[Return|return]].

If an investor has a choice between a U.S. [[government bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp) paying 3% interest and a corporate bond paying 8% interest and he chooses the government bond, the payoff differential is the certainty equivalent. The corporation would need to [[Offer|offer]] this particular investor a potential [[Return|return]] of more than 8% on its bonds to convince him to buy.

A company seeking investors can use the certainty equivalent as a basis for determining how much more it needs to pay to convince investors to consider the riskier option. The certainty equivalent varies because each investor has a unique [[Risk|risk]] tolerance.

The term is also used in gambling, to represent the amount of payoff someone would require to be indifferent between it and a given gamble. This is called the gamble's certainty equivalent.

## Example of How to Use the Certainty Equivalent

The idea of certainty equivalent can be applied to [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] from an investment. The certainty equivalent cash flow is the [[risk-free]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]]-freereturn.asp) cash flow that an investor or manager considers equal to a different expected cash flow which is higher, but also riskier. The formula for calculating the certainty equivalent cash flow is as follows:

Certainty Equivalent Cash Flow\=Expected Cash Flow(1 + [[Risk]] [[Premium]])\\text{Certainty Equivalent [[Cash Flow]]} = \\frac{\\text{Expected Cash Flow}}{\\left(1\\ +\\ \\text{Risk Premium} \\right )}

The [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] is calculated as the risk-adjusted rate of [[Return|return]] minus the risk-free rate. The expected [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] is calculated by taking the probability-[[Weighted|weighted]] dollar value of each expected cash flow and adding them up.

For example, imagine that an investor has the choice to accept a guaranteed $10 million cash inflow or an option with the following expectations:

-   A 30% chance of receiving $7.5 million
-   A 50% chance of receiving $15.5 million
-   A 20% chance of receiving $4 million

Based on these probabilities, the expected [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] of this scenario is:

Expected Cash Flow\=0.3×$7.5 Million+0.5×$15.5 Million+0.2×$4 Million\=$10.8 Million\\begin{aligned} \\text{Expected [[Cash Flow]]} &= 0.3\\times\\$7.5\\text{ Million}\\\\&\\quad + 0.5\\times \\$15.5\\text{ Million}\\\\&\\quad + 0.2\\times\\$4\\text{ Million}\\\\ &=\\$10.8 \\text{ Million} \\end{aligned}

Assume the [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) used to discount this option is 12% and the risk-free rate is 3%. Thus, the risk [[Premium|premium]] is (12% - 3%), or 9%. Using the above equation, the certainty equivalent [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] is:

Certainty Equivalent Cash Flow\=$10.8 Million(1+0.09)\=$9.908 Million\\begin{aligned} \\text{Certainty Equivalent [[Cash Flow]]} &= \\frac{\\$10.8 \\text{ Million}}{\\left(1 + 0.09 \\right )} \\\\ &=\\$9.908 \\text{ Million} \\end{aligned}

Based on this, if the investor prefers to avoid [[Risk|risk]], he should accept any guaranteed option worth more than $9.908 million.
