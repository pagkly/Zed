[[Life Expectancy]]
## What Is [[Life Expectancy]]?

[[Life Expectancy|Life expectancy]] is the statistical age that a person is expected to live until, based on actuarial data. There are many uses for it in the financial world, including life insurance, pension planning, and U.S. [[Social Security]] benefits. In most countries, the calculations for this [[actuarial age]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actuarial-age.asp) is derived from a national statistical agency based on large amounts of data.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Life Expectancy|Life expectancy]] is a statistical prediction for how long a person [[Will|will]] live.
-   Based on actuarial science, [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] takes into account several individual-level as well as population-level factors to arrive at a figure.
-   [[Life Expectancy|Life expectancy]] is used in pricing and underwriting life insurance and insurance products like annuities, as well as in retirement and pension planning.

## Understanding [[Life Expectancy]]

[[Life Expectancy|Life expectancy]] is the single most influential factor that insurance companies use to determine life [insurance premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-[[Premium|premium]].asp). Using actuarial tables provided by the Internal Revenue Service, these companies try to minimize the [[Liability|liability]] [[Risk|risk]].

There are several factors that affect your [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]], the two single most important being when you were born and your gender. Additional factors that can influence your life expectancy include:

-   Your race
-   Personal health
-   Family medical history
-   Whether you smoke cigarettes or make other risky lifestyle choices

You can view the federal government's data on U.S. [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] on the [National Center for Health Statistic's website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm) and the [Social [[Security]] Administration's Actuarial Period Life Table](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4c6.html).

It's important to note that [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] changes over time. That's because as you age, [[actuaries]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actuary.asp) use complex formulas that factor out people who are younger than you but who have died. As you continue to age past mid-life, you outlive an increasing number of people who are younger than you, so your life expectancy actually increases. In other words, the older you get (past a certain age), the older you are likely to get.

Overall, human [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] has been rapidly increasing during the past two hundred years, particularly in developing countries. In 2020, the average life expectancy in the United States is 78.9 years.1

## [[Life Expectancy]] and Life Insurance

[[Life Expectancy|Life expectancy]] is the primary factor in determining an individual's [[Risk|risk]] factor and the likelihood they [[Will|will]] make a claim. Insurance companies consider age, lifestyle choices, family medical history, and several other factors when determining [[Premium|premium]] rates for individual life insurance policies.

There is a direct [[Correlation|correlation]] between your [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] and how much you'll be charged for a [life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp) policy. The younger you are when you purchase a life insurance policy, the longer you are likely to live. That means there is a lower [[Risk|risk]] to the [life insurance company](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/092915/biggest-life-insurance-companies-us.asp) because you are less likely to die in the [near term](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nearterm.asp), which would require a [[Payout|payout]] of the full benefit of your policy before you have paid much into the policy.

Conversely, the longer you wait to purchase life insurance, the lower your [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]], and that translates into a higher [[Risk|risk]] for the life insurance company. Companies compensate for that risk by charging a higher [[Premium|premium]].

The principle of [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] suggests that you should purchase a life insurance policy for yourself and your spouse sooner rather than later. Not only [[Will|will]] you save money through lower [[Premium|premium]] costs, but you will also have longer for your policy to accumulate value and become a potentially significant financial resource as you age.

## Retirement and Annuity Planning

[[Life Expectancy|Life expectancy]] is critical for [[retirement planning]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement-planning.asp). Many aging workers arrange their retirement plans' asset allocations based on a prediction of how long they expect to live. Personal, rather than statistical, life expectancy is a primary factor in the character of a retirement plan. When couples are planning for retirement or annuity payments, they often use a [[Joint|joint]] life expectancy in which they take the life expectancy of their partner (who may become the beneficiary of a retirement fund or annuity plan) into account as well.

Most retirement plans, including the traditional and Roth, SEP, and [[SIMPLE IRA]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-ira.asp) plans, also use [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] to determine the implementation of [[required minimum distributions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredminimumdistribution.asp)  
(RMDs) for the plan. Most retirement plans expect participants to begin taking at least the RMD by the time they reach the age of 72 (previously 70½). Retirement plans set distributions on the IRS [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] tables. Some qualified plans may allow RMD distributions to begin at a later date.

Due to an increase in [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]], the SECURE Act adjusted the required minimum distribution age from 70½ to 72—for individuals who attain age 70½ after Dec. 31, 2019. Those who have reached 70½ during 2019 or earlier are not affected.

Your [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] is also a significant factor when arranging [[annuity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuity.asp) payments with an insurance company. In an annuity contract, the insurance company agrees to pay a certain amount of money for a fixed period or until the policyholder's death. It's important to take life expectancy into account when negotiating annuity contracts. If you agree to receive payouts for a specific period, it is tantamount to estimate how long you might expect to live. You may also elect to use a single-[[Life Annuity|life annuity]] payment plan in which annuity payments [[Will|will]] cease after your death.
