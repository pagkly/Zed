[[Monetarist Theory Definition]]
## What is the Monetarist Theory?

The monetarist theory is an economic concept, which contends that changes [[in money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp) [[Supply|supply]] are the most significant determinants of the rate of economic growth and the behavior of the business cycle. The competing theory to the monetarist theory is [[Keynesian Economics]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp). When monetarist theory works in practice, central banks, which control the levers of monetary policy, can exert much power over economic [[Growth Rates|growth rates]].

### Key Takeaways

-   According to monetarist theory, money [[Supply|supply]] is the most important determinant of the rate of economic growth.
-   It is governed by the MV = PQ formula, in which M = Money [[Supply|supply]], V = Velocity of money, P = Price of goods, and Q = Quantity of goods and services.
-   The federal reserve controls money in the United States and uses three main levers—reserve ratio, [[Discount Rate|discount rate]], and open market operations—to increase or decrease money [[Supply|supply]] in the economy.

## Understanding Monetarist Theory

According to monetarist theory, if a nation's [[Supply|supply]] of money increases, economic activity [[Will|will]] increase; the reverse is also true. Monetarist theory is governed by a simple formula, MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity (number of times per year the average dollar is spent), P is the price of goods and services and Q is the quantity of goods and services. Assuming constant V, when M is increased, either P, Q, or both P and Q rise. General price levels tend to rise more than the production of goods and services when the economy is closer to [[Full Employment|full employment]].

When there is slack in the economy, Q [[Will|will]] increase at a faster rate than P under monetarist theory. In the U.S., the [[Federal Reserve Board]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frb.asp) ("Fed") sets monetary policy without government interference. The Federal Reserve operates on a monetarist theory that focuses on maintaining stable prices (low inflation), promoting [[Full Employment|full employment]] and achieving steady [[GDP]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) growth.

## Controlling Money [[Supply]]

In the U.S., it is the job of the Fed to control the money [[Supply|supply]]. The Fed has three main levers: [[reserve ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reserveratio.asp), [[discount rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal_discount_rate.asp), and [[open market operations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openmarketoperations.asp). The reserve ratio is the percentage of reserves a bank is required to [[Hold|hold]] against deposits. A decrease in the ratio enables banks to lend more, thereby increasing the supply of money. The [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] is the interest rate that the Fed charges commercial banks that need to borrow additional reserves. A drop in the discount rate [[Will|will]] encourage a bank to borrow more from the Fed and therefore lend more to its customers. Open market operations consist of buying and selling government securities. Buying securities from large banks increases the supply of money, while selling securities contracts decreases the money supply in the economy.

## Example of Monetarist Theory

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was a proponent of monetarist theory. During his initial years at the Fed in 1988, he increased interest rates, decreasing growth and raising inflation rates, which almost touched five percent. The U.S. economy tipped into recession during the early 1990s. However, Chairman Greenspan boosted economic prospects by commencing on a rate-cutting spree that resulted in the longest period of economic expansion in the U.S. economy during its history. A loose monetary policy of low interest rates made the U.S. economy prone to bubbles, culminating in the 2008 [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] and the [[Great Recession]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp).
