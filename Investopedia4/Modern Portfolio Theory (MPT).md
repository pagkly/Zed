[[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)]]
## What Is [[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)]]?

Modern [[portfolio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp) theory (MPT) is a theory on how [[Risk|risk]]-averse investors can construct portfolios to maximize [[expected return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) based on a given level of market risk. [[Harry Markowitz]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harrymarkowitz.asp) pioneered this theory in his paper "Portfolio Selection," which was published in the [[Journal]] of [[Finance]] in 1952.1 He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on modern portfolio theory.2

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)|Modern portfolio theory (MPT)]] is a theory on how [[Risk|risk]]-averse investors can construct portfolios to maximize expected [[Return|return]] based on a given level of market risk.
-   MPT can also be used to construct a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] that minimizes [[Risk|risk]] for a given level of expected [[Return|return]].
-   Modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory is very useful for investors trying to construct efficient portfolios using ETFs.
-   Investors who are more concerned with downside [[Risk|risk]] than variance might prefer post-modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory (PMPT) to MPT.

#### [[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)]]

## Understanding [[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)]]

Modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory argues that an investment's [[Risk|risk]] and [[Return|return]] characteristics should not be viewed alone, but should be evaluated by how the investment affects the overall portfolio's risk and return. MPT shows that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that [[Will|will]] maximize returns for a given level of risk. Likewise, given a desired level of expected return, an investor can construct a portfolio with the lowest possible risk. Based on statistical measures such as [[variance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp) and [[correlation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Correlation|correlation]].asp), an individual investment's performance is less important than how it impacts the entire portfolio.3

MPT assumes that investors are [[Risk|risk]]-averse, meaning they prefer a less risky [[Portfolio|portfolio]] to a riskier one for a given level of [[Return|return]]. As a practical matter, risk aversion implies that most people should invest in multiple [[asset classes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp).3

The expected [[Return|return]] of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is calculated as a [[weighted]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Weighted|weighted]].asp) sum of the individual assets' returns. If a portfolio contained four equally weighted assets with expected returns of 4, 6, 10, and 14%, the portfolio's expected return would be:

(4% x 25%) + (6% x 25%) + (10% x 25%) + (14% x 25%) = 8.5%

The [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s [[Risk|risk]] is a complicated function of the variances of each asset and the correlations of each pair of assets. To calculate the risk of a four-asset portfolio, an investor needs each of the four assets' variances and six [[Correlation|correlation]] values, since there are six possible two-asset combinations with four assets. Because of the asset correlations, the total portfolio risk, or [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp), is lower than what would be calculated by a [[Weighted|weighted]] sum.3

## Benefits of [[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)]]

MPT is [[a useful tool]](https://www.investopedia.com/managing-wealth/modern-[[Portfolio|portfolio]]-theory-why-its-still-hip/) for investors trying to build [[diversified]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Diversification|diversification]].asp) portfolios. In fact, the growth of exchange traded funds ([ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)) made MPT more relevant by giving investors easier access to different asset classes. [[Stock]] investors can use MPT to reduce [[Risk|risk]] by putting a small portion of their portfolios in [[government bond ETFs]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080515/top-4-us-government-bonds-etfs.asp). The variance of the portfolio [[Will|will]] be significantly lower because government bonds have a negative [[Correlation|correlation]] with [[Stocks|stocks]]. Adding a small investment in Treasuries to a stock portfolio will not have a large impact on expected returns because of this loss reducing effect.3

Similarly, MPT can be used to reduce the [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) of a U.S. Treasury [[Portfolio|portfolio]] by putting 10% in a [[small-cap value index fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020416/5-best-us-small-cap-value-index-mutual-funds.asp) or ETF. Although small-cap value [[Stocks|stocks]] are far riskier than Treasuries on their own, they often do well during periods of high [[inflation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) when bonds do poorly. As a result, the portfolio's overall volatility is lower than one consisting entirely of government bonds. Furthermore, the expected returns are higher.3

Modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory allows investors to construct more efficient portfolios. Every possible combination of assets that exists can be plotted on a graph, with the portfolio's [[Risk|risk]] on the X-axis and the expected [[Return|return]] on the [[Y]]-axis. This plot reveals the most desirable portfolios. For example, suppose Portfolio A has an expected return of 8.5% and a [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of 8%. Further, assume that Portfolio B has an expected return of 8.5% and a standard deviation of 9.5%. Portfolio A would be deemed more efficient because it has the same expected return but lower risk.3

It is possible to draw an upward sloping curve to connect all of the most efficient portfolios. This curve is called the [[efficient frontier]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp). Investing in a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] underneath the curve is not desirable because it does not maximize returns for a given level of [[Risk|risk]].3

Most portfolios on the efficient frontier contain ETFs from more than one asset class.

## Criticism of [[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)]]

Perhaps the most serious criticism of MPT is that it evaluates portfolios based on variance rather than [[downside risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downsiderisk.asp). Two portfolios that have the same level of variance and returns are considered equally desirable under modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory. One portfolio may have that variance because of frequent small losses. In contrast, the other could have that variance because of rare spectacular declines. Most investors would prefer frequent small losses, which would be easier to endure. Post-modern portfolio theory ([PMPT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pmpt.asp)) attempts to improve on modern portfolio theory by minimizing downside [[Risk|risk]] instead of variance.3

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory?

Modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory, introduced by [[Harry Markowitz]] in 1952, is a portfolio construction theory that determines the minimum level of [[Risk|risk]] for an expected [[Return|return]]. It assumes that investors [[Will|will]] favor a portfolio with a lower risk level over a higher risk level for the same level of return. A central part of modern portfolio theory is how an individual [[Security|security]] impacts the risk and return profile of an entire portfolio. 

### What are the benefits of modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory?

Modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory can be used as a means to diversify portfolios. By integrating a diverse set of assets a portfolio can reduce its variance. Another benefit of modern portfolio theory is that it can be used to reduce [[Volatility|volatility]]. By introducing assets in a portfolio that have a negative [[Correlation|correlation]], such as U.S. treasuries and small-cap [[Stocks|stocks]], a portfolio could realize stronger returns rather than exclusively holding one type of asset within a portfolio. Ultimately, modern portfolio theory is used to create the most efficient portfolio possible.

### What is the importance of the efficient frontier?

The efficient frontier, a cornerstone of modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory, shows the set of portfolios that provide the highest level of [[Return|return]] for the lowest level of [[Risk|risk]]. When a portfolio falls to the right of the efficient frontier, they possess greater risk relative to their return. Conversely, when a portfolio falls beneath the slope of the efficient frontier, they [[Offer|offer]] a lower level of return relative to risk.
