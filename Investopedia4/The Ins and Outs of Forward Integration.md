[[The Ins and Outs of Forward Integration]]
## What Is Forward Integration?

Forward integration is a business strategy that involves a form of downstream [[vertical integration]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp) whereby the company owns and controls business activities that are ahead in the value chain of its industry, this might include among others direct distribution or [[Supply|supply]] of the company's products. This type of [[Vertical Integration|vertical integration]] is conducted by a company advancing along the [[supply chain]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp).

A good example of forward integration would be a farmer who directly sells his crops at a local grocery store rather than to a distribution center that controls the placement of foodstuffs to various supermarkets. Or, a clothing label that opens up its own boutiques, selling its designs directly to customers instead of or in addition to selling them through department stores.

## How Forward Integration Works

Often referred to as "cutting out the middleman," forward integration is an operational strategy implemented by a company that wants to increase control over its suppliers, manufacturers, or distributors, so it can increase its market power. For a forward integration to be successful, a company needs to [[Gain|gain]] ownership over other companies that were once customers. This strategy differs from [[backward integration]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backwardintegration.asp) in which a company tries to increase ownership over companies that were once its suppliers.

A company implements forward integration strategies when it wants to exert a wider control over the value chain of its industry, optimize economies of [[Scope|scope]], and target better cost structure, thereby increasing its industry market share and profitability.

The rise of the internet has made forward integration both easier and a more popular approach to business strategy. A manufacturer, for example, has the ability to set up an online store and use [[Digital Marketing|digital marketing]] to sell its products. Previously, it had to use retail companies and marketing firms to effectively sell the products.

The goal of forward integration is for a company to move forward in the [[Supply|supply]] chain, increasing its overall ownership of the industry. Standard industries are made up of five steps in the supply chain: raw materials, [[intermediate goods]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intermediate-good.asp), [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]], marketing and sales, and after-sale service. If a company wants to conduct a forward integration, it must advance along the chain while still maintaining control of its current operations—its original place in the chain, so to speak.

### Key Takeaways

-   Forward integration is a business strategy that involves expanding a company's activities to include the direct distribution of its products.
-   Forward integration is colloquially referred to as "cutting out the middleman."
-   While forward integration can be a way to increase a company's control of its product and profits, there can be a danger of diluting the [[Core Competencies|core competencies]] and business.

## Special Considerations for Forward Integration

Companies should be aware of the costs and [[Scope|scope]] associated with a forward integration. They should only engage in this sort of strategy if there are cost benefits and if the integration won't dilute its current [[Core Competencies|core competencies]]. Sometimes it is more effective for a company to rely on the established expertise and [[economies of scale]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp) of other vendors, rather than expand on its own.

## Example of Forward Integration

For example, the company Intel supplies Dell with intermediate goods—its processors—that are placed within Dell's hardware. If Intel wanted to move forward in the [[Supply|supply]] chain, it could conduct a merger or acquisition of Dell in order to own the [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] portion of the industry.

Additionally, if Dell wanted to engage in forward integration, it could seek to take control of a marketing agency that the company previously used to market its end-product. However, Dell cannot seek to take over Intel if it wants to integrate forward. Only a backward integration allows a movement up the [[Supply|supply]] chain its case.
