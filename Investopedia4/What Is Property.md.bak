[[What Is Property]]?
## [[What Is Property]]?

Property is a term describing anything that a person or a business has legal title over, affording owners certain enforceable rights over said items. Examples of property, which may be tangible or intangible, include automotive vehicles, industrial equipment, furniture, and real [[Estate|estate]]--the last of which is often referred to as "[[Real Property|real property]]." Most properties [[Hold|hold]] current or potential monetary value and are therefore considered to be assets. But properties can simultaneously be liabilities in some situations. Case in point: if a customer sustains an injury on a company's property, the business owner may be legally responsible for paying the injured party's medical bills.

### Key Takeaways

-   Property is any item that a person or a business has legal title over.
-   Property can be tangible items, such as houses, cars, or appliances, or it can refer to intangible items that carry the promise of future worth, such as [[Stock|stock]] and bond certificates.
-   Intellectual property refers to ideas such as logo designs and patents.
-   Property owners may also have liabilities, which is the case if a business owner is on the hook for medical expenses resulting from a customer incurring an injury on his company's grounds.

## Understanding Types of Property

Intangible property describes assets that represent current or potential value, but that don't carry intrinsic value themselves, such as [[Stock|stock]] and bond certificates. While these items are merely pieces of paper, they might represent significant amounts of money, once [[Stocks|stocks]] are redeemed, and bonds reach their maturity. Other types of intangible property, such as a brand’s reputation, are more nebulous, and cannot be signified by a paper document.

Intangible properties, like design concepts, song lyrics, books, and screenplays, are categorized as [[intellectual properties]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intellectualproperty.asp). Even though these entities are not physical in nature, they may nevertheless carry significant value. Examples of intellectual properties include Nike’s “swoosh” logo and the chemical formula for Coca-Cola. To enforce ownership of intangible properties, individuals and businesses typically hire lawyers to legally protect their items from infringement.

## Evaluating Property Assets

When auditors, appraisers, and analysts calculate the [[value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp) of a business, they factor all of its [[Underlying|underlying]] property into the equation. For example, a manufacturer of small machine parts may gross just $80,000 per year, but if it owns the factory in which it operates, and that building is appraised at $1 million, the overall value of the business would be substantially higher than profits alone suggest. Furthermore, if that same company holds a patent for a part, it has the potential to generate substantial income by [[licensing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/licensing-revenue.asp) the rights to manufacture that item to a larger business, rather then producing the part in-house. In this way, licensing deals may create lucrative revenue streams that significantly boost a company’s overall value.

## Establishing [[Net Worth]] Through Property

An individual's [[net worth]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networth.asp) may be determined by calculating the total value of the properties they own, such as real [[Estate|estate]], cars, jewelry, [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, and retirement savings, and then subtracting any liabilities or debts from that figure. For example, if an individual's assets include a $100,000 home, a $7,000 car, and a $65,000 IRA, the tally of their property comes to $172,000. But if that same individual is saddled with a $20,000 student [[Loan|loan]] and a $3,000 credit card bill, the total liabilities add up to $23,000. Thus, the total [[Net Worth|net worth]] would be $149,000 ($172,000 - $23,000).

When calculating an individual's [[Net Worth|net worth]], less valuable items, such as furniture or articles of clothing are generally not factored into the equation, unless said items [[Hold|hold]] significant value as antiques or as rare collectibles.
