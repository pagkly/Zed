[[Wells Notice]]
## What Is a [[Wells Notice]]?

A [[Wells Notice]] is a notification issued by regulators to inform individuals or companies of completed investigations where infractions have been discovered. It usually takes the form of a letter, which notifies recipients both of the broad nature of the violations uncovered as well as the nature of the enforcement proceedings to be initiated against the recipient.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Wells Notice]] is a formal notice from the SEC informing a recipient that the agency is planning to bring enforcement actions against them.1
-   A [[Wells Notice]] letter is sent at the end of an investigation into potential securities-law or regulatory violations.
-   The accused may respond to the [[Wells Notice]] within 30 days via a Wells Submission, taking the form of a legal brief.2

## Understanding Wells Notices

The [[Wells Notice|Wells notice]] is named after the Wells Committee, formed in 1972 by then-SEC Chairman William J. Casey in order to review the enforcement practices and policies of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC), and chaired by John Wells.3

The receipt of a [[Wells Notice]] means that the SEC may bring a civil action against the person or firm named therein, and gives said person or firm the chance to [[Offer|offer]] information as to why such an action shouldn’t be brought. About 80% of those who received a Wells Notice during the period from 2011 to 2013, for instance, later faced charges for securities law violations.4

## Responding to a [[Wells Notice]]

After receiving a [[Wells Notice]], recipients have a chance for prospective defendants in SEC enforcement proceedings to speak on their own behalves, directly to the decision-makers involved in the case.

A prospective defendant’s response to a [[Wells Notice]] is known as a Wells Submission_._ Prospective defendants have 30 days to make a Wells Submission, which should take the form of a legal brief, and include both factual and legal arguments to prove why charges should not be brought against the prospective defendants.

A Wells Submission, and its contents, are public information, and as a result, most securities law attorneys may advise that making such a submission is not always to the prospective defendants’ best interests. Anything alleged in the Wells Submission can be used against the defendant in the enforcement proceedings; it can also be subpoenaed and used against the respondents in any other civil litigation brought against the defendants.

## The “Pre-Wells” Process

In some cases, regulators are willing to start a dialog with the accused party at the conclusion of their investigation, but before issuing a formal [[Wells Notice]]. When this occurs, it may be referred to as a “pre-Wells” process.

This process [[Will|will]] often include written submissions and oral arguments made by the defense counsel. The SEC may be willing to engage in a pre-Wells process if a case involves novel or highly technical issues, or significant policy questions. In other cases, the SEC is willing to allow a pre-Wells process because they believe it will facilitate reaching a settlement. Finally, there may be extenuating circumstances in a particular case that cause regulators to be willing to proceed on a pre-Wells basis.
