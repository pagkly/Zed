[[Debt Overhang]]
## What Is [[Debt Overhang]]?

[[Debt Overhang|Debt overhang]] refers to a [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp) burden so large that an entity cannot take on additional debt to [[Finance|finance]] future projects. This includes entities that are profitable enough to be able to reduce indebtedness over time. A debt overhang serves to dissuade current investment, since all earnings from new projects would only go to existing debt holders, leaving little incentive and ability for the entity to attempt to dig itself out of the hole.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Debt Overhang|Debt overhang]] refers to a [[Debt|debt]] burden so large that an entity cannot take on additional debt to [[Finance|finance]] future projects.
-   The burden is so large that all earnings pay off existing [[Debt|debt]] rather than fund new investment projects, making the potential for defaulting higher.
-   [[Debt]] overhangs can lead to underinvestment, which stunts growth, making recovery even more difficult.

## Understanding [[Debt Overhang]]

When an entity has an excessive amount of [[Debt|debt]] and cannot borrow more [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp), that entity is said to be in a [[Debt Overhang|debt overhang]]. The burden is so large that any and all earnings go directly to pay off existing debt rather than fund new investment projects, making the potential for [[Default|default]] higher. In most cases, shareholders may be reluctant to approve new [[Stock|stock]] issuances because shareholders may be on the hook for losses.

[[Debt]] overhangs also apply to sovereign governments. In these cases, the term refers to a situation in which the debt of a nation exceeds its future capacity to repay it. This can occur from an output gap or economic [[underemployment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underemployment|underemployment]].asp), repeatedly plugged by the creation of additional credit. A [[Debt Overhang|debt overhang]] can lead to stagnant growth and a degradation of [[living standards]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp) from reduced funds to spending in critical areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

Because of the way they affect [[balance sheets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) and bottom lines, [[Debt|debt]] overhangs can distress entities in different ways. They can cause companies and countries to put a pause on further spending and/or investment. In fact, they can lead to [[underinvestment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underinvestment_problem.asp). Because they can stunt growth, debt overhangs can make recovery even more difficult.

There are several ways to get out of a [[Debt Overhang|debt overhang]]. Debtors can enroll in [[Debt|debt]] cancellation programs to get a portion of or the entirety of their debts forgiven by [creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp), nations can [[Default|default]] on their debt, companies may go insolvent or [[bankrupt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp), or existing debt may be repurchased and converted into [[Equity|equity]].

The [[Risk|risk]] of defaulting on [[Debt|debt]] is greater when a company or country experiences a [[Debt Overhang|debt overhang]].

## Special Considerations

A [[Debt Overhang|debt overhang]] can trap companies as a greater proportion of revenues or [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] simply goes toward servicing its existing [[Debt|debt]]. This widening [[deficit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit.asp) can only be filled through incremental debt, which only increases a company's burden.

A [[Debt Overhang|debt overhang]] is particularly difficult as it straps companies aiming to take advantage of new opportunities with positive [[net present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) (NPV). Although under more normal conditions, these potential projects would repay themselves over time, a ballooning existing [[Debt|debt]] position in a company could likely turn off would-be investors in the project. Given that the company’s debt holders can be reasonably expected to lay claim to a portion or all of the new project’s profits, the NPV would, in effect, be negative.

To solve the [[Debt Overhang|debt overhang]] in many developing nations, [[Debt|debt]] cancellation programs are occasionally implemented by intergovernmental organizations such as the [[World Bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldbank.asp) and international organizations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imf.asp) (IMF). Programs have covered Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, and Zambia. Another program, the Jubilee 2000 campaign, was an international movement by 40 countries, which called for the cancellation of debt of developing nations by the year 2000. Although the campaign didn't meet all of its goals, it was well received and was generally considered to be successful.
