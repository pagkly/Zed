[[Money Supply Definition]]
## What is Money [[Supply]]?

The money [[Supply|supply]] is all the currency and other liquid instruments in a country's economy on the date measured. The money supply roughly includes both cash and deposits that can be used almost as easily as cash.

Governments issue paper currency and coin through some combination of their central banks and treasuries. Bank regulators influence money [[Supply|supply]] available to the public through the requirements placed on banks to [[Hold|hold]] reserves, how to extend credit and other regulation.

## Understanding Money [[Supply]]

Economists analyze the money [[Supply|supply]] and develop policies revolving around it through [[controlling interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/controllinginterest.asp) rates and increasing or decreasing the amount of money flowing in the economy. Public and [[private sector]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp) analysis is performed because of the money supply's possible impacts on [[Price Level|price level]], [[inflation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp), and the business cycle. In the United States, the Federal Reserve policy is the most important deciding factor in the money supply. The money supply is also known as the money [[Stock|stock]].

## Effect of Money [[Supply]] on the Economy

An increase in the [[Supply|supply]] of money typically lowers interest rates, which in turn, generates more [[investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp) and puts more money in the hands of consumers, thereby stimulating spending. Businesses respond by ordering more raw materials and increasing production. The increased business activity raises the [[Demand For Labor|demand for labor]]. The opposite can occur if the money supply falls or when its growth rate declines.

Change in the money [[Supply|supply]] has long been considered to be a key factor in driving macroeconomic performance and business cycles. Macroeconomic schools of thought that focus heavily on the role of money supply include Irving Fisher's [[Quantity Theory of Money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantity_theory_of_money.asp), [[Monetarism]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarism.asp), and [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/09/austrian-school-of-economics.asp).

Historically, measuring the money [[Supply|supply]] has shown that relationships exist between it and [[inflation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) and [[price levels]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_level.asp). However, since 2000, these relationships have become unstable, reducing their reliability as a guide for monetary policy. Although money supply measures are still widely used, they are one of a wide array of economic data that economists and the Federal Reserve collects and reviews.1

## How Money [[Supply]] is Measured

The various types of money in the money [[Supply|supply]] are generally classified as Ms, such as M0, M1, [[M2]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp) and [[M3]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[M3|m3]].asp), according to the type and size of the account in which the instrument is kept. Not all of the classifications are widely used, and each country may use different classifications. The money supply reflects the different types of [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) each type of money has in the economy. It is broken up into different categories of liquidity or spendability.2

[M1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m1.asp), for example, is also called narrow money and includes coins and notes that are in circulation and other money equivalents that can be converted easily to cash. M2 includes M1 and, in addition, short-term [[time deposits]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedeposit.asp) in banks and certain [[Money Market|money market]] funds.1 [[M3]] includes M2 in addition to long-term deposits. However, M3 is no longer included in the reporting by the Federal Reserve.3 MZM, or money zero maturity, is a measure that includes financial assets with zero maturity and that are immediately redeemable at par. The Federal Reserve relies heavily on MZM data because its velocity is a proven indicator of inflation.4

Money [[Supply|supply]] data is collected, recorded, and published periodically, typically by the country's government or central bank. The Federal Reserve in the United States measures and publishes the total amount of M1 and M2 money supplies on a weekly and monthly basis. They can be found online and are also published in newspapers. According to data from the [[Federal Reserve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp), as of Feb. 11, 2021, a little over $18.1 trillion in M1 money was in circulation, and about $19.4 trillion in M2 money was circulating in the United States.5
