Inside the [[Risk]]/Reward Ratio
## What Is the [[Risk]]/Reward Ratio?

The [[Risk|risk]]/reward ratio marks the prospective reward an investor can earn for every dollar they risk on an investment. Many investors use risk/reward ratios to compare the [[expected returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) of an investment with the amount of risk they must undertake to earn these returns. Consider the following example: an investment with a risk-reward ratio of 1:7 suggests that an investor is willing to risk $1, for the prospect of earning $7. Alternatively, a risk/reward ratio of 1:3 signals that an investor should expect to invest $1, for the prospect of earning $3 on their investment.

Traders often use this approach to plan which trades to take, and the ratio is calculated by dividing the amount a trader stands to lose if the price of an asset moves in an unexpected direction (the [[Risk|risk]]) by the amount of profit the [[trader]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) expects to have made when the position is closed (the reward).

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Risk|risk]]/reward ratio is used by traders and investors to manage their capital and risk of loss.
-   The ratio helps assess the expected [[Return|return]] and [[Risk|risk]] of a given trade.
-   An appropriate [[Risk|risk]] reward ratio tends to be anything greater than 1:3.

## How the [[Risk]]/Reward Ratio Works

In many cases, market strategists find the ideal [[Risk|risk]]/reward ratio for their investments to be approximately 1:3, or three units of expected [[Return|return]] for every one unit of additional risk. Investors can manage risk/reward more directly through the use of stop-loss orders and derivatives such as [[put options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp).

The [[Risk|risk]]/reward ratio is often used as a measure when trading individual [[Stocks|stocks]]. The optimal risk/reward ratio differs widely among various trading strategies. Some trial-and-error methods are usually required to determine which ratio is best for a given trading strategy, and many investors have a pre-specified risk/reward ratio for their investments.

## What Does the [[Risk]]/Reward Ratio Tell You?

The [[Risk|risk]]/reward ratio helps investors manage their risk of losing money on trades. Even if a trader has some profitable trades, they [[Will|will]] lose money over time if their win rate is below 50%. The risk/reward ratio measures the difference between a trade entry point to a stop-loss and a sell or take-profit order. Comparing these two provides the ratio of profit to loss, or reward to risk.

Investors often use stop-loss orders when trading individual [[Stocks|stocks]] to help minimize losses and directly manage their investments with a [[Risk|risk]]/reward focus. A stop-loss order is a trading trigger placed on a [[Stock|stock]] that automates the selling of the stock from a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] if the stock reaches a specified low. Investors can automatically set stop-loss orders through brokerage accounts and typically do not require exorbitant additional trading costs.

## Example of the [[Risk]]/Reward Ratio in Use

Consider this example: A trader purchases 100 [[Shares|shares]] of XYZ Company at $20 and places a [[stop-loss order]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) at $15 to ensure that losses [[Will|will]] not exceed $500. Also, assume that this trader believes that the price of XYZ will reach $30 in the next few months. In this case, the trader is willing to [[Risk|risk]] $5 per share to make an expected [[Return|return]] of $10 per share after closing the position. Since the trader stands to make double the amount that they have risked, they would be said to have a 1:2 risk/reward ratio on that particular trade. Derivatives contracts such as put contracts, which give their owners the right to sell the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset at a specified price, can be used to similar effect.

If an investor prefers to seek a 1:5 [[Risk|risk]]/reward ratio for a specified investment (five units of expected [[Return|return]] for each additional unit of risk), then they can modify the stop-loss order and thus adjust the risk/reward ratio. But it is important to understand that by doing so the investors has changed the probability of success in their trade.

In the trading example noted above, suppose an investor set a stop-loss order at $18, instead of $15, and they continued to target a $30 profit-taking exit. By doing so they would certainly reduce the size of the potential loss (assuming no change to the number of [[Shares|shares]]), but they [[Will|will]] have increased the likelihood that the [[Price Action|price action]] will trigger their stop loss order. That's because the [[Stop Order|stop order]] is proportionally much closer to the entry than the target price is. So although the investor may stand to make a proportionally larger [[Gain|gain]] (compared to the potential loss), they have a lower probability of receiving this outcome.
