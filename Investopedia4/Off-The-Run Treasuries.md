[[Off-The-Run Treasuries]]
## What Are [[Off-The-Run Treasuries]]?

[[Off-The-Run Treasuries|Off-the-run treasuries]] are all Treasury bonds and notes issued before the most recently issued bond or note of a particular maturity.

[[Off-The-Run Treasuries|Off-the-run treasuries]] can be contrasted with [[on-the-run treasuries]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/on-the-runtreasuries.asp), which refer to the newest issues only.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Off-The-Run Treasuries|Off-the-run treasuries]] refer to any Treasury [[Security|security]] that has been issued, except for the newest issue, which are called on-the-run.
-   [[Off-The-Run Treasuries|Off-the-run treasuries]] tend to be somewhat less liquid than on-the-run securities, although they are still actively traded on the secondary market.
-   The price difference between on-the-run and [[Off-The-Run Treasuries|off-the-run Treasuries]] is often referred to as the [[Liquidity|liquidity]] [[Premium|premium]], as the more liquid Treasuries are obtained at a higher cost.

## [[Off-The-Run Treasuries]] Explained

When the [[U.S. Treasury]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp) issues securities – Treasury notes, and bonds – it does so through an [[auction process]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp) to determine the price at which these [[Debt|debt]] instruments [[Will|will]] be offered. Based on the bids received and the level of interest shown for the [[Security|security]], the U.S. Treasury is able to set a price for its debt securities. The new issues presented after the auction is closed are referred to as [[On-The-Run Treasuries|on-the-run Treasuries]]. Once a new Treasury security of any maturity is issued, the previously issued security with the same maturity becomes the off-the-run bond or note.

For example, if the U.S. Treasury newly issued 5-year notes in February, these notes are on-the-run and replace the previously issued 5-year notes, which become off-the-run. In March, if another batch of 5-year bonds is issued, these March notes are [[On-The-Run Treasuries|on-the-run Treasuries]] and the February notes are now off-the-run. And so on.

## Where to Trade [[Off-The-Run Treasuries]]

While [[On-The-Run Treasuries|on-the-run Treasuries]] are available to be purchased from [[Treasury Direct]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurydirect.asp), off-the-run securities can only be obtained from other investors through the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp). When Treasuries move to the secondary over-the-counter market, they become less frequently traded as investors prefer to go for more liquid securities (which are a characteristic of on-the-run Treasuries). To encourage investors to purchase these [[Debt|debt]] securities readily in the market, [[Off-The-Run Treasuries|off-the-run Treasuries]] are typically less expensive and carry a slightly greater [[Yield|yield]].

Since [[Off-The-Run Treasuries|off-the-run Treasuries]] have a higher [[Yield|yield]] and lower price than [[On-The-Run Treasuries|on-the-run Treasuries]], there is a notable [[yield spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldspread.asp) between both offerings. One reason for the yield spread is the concept of [[Supply|supply]]. On-the-run Treasuries are typically issued with a fixed supply. The high demand for the limited securities pushes up their prices and, in turn, lowers the yield, causing a difference to ensue between the yields for on-the-run and off-the-run securities. In addition, off-the-run securities are mostly held to maturity in an asset manager’s [[Portfolio|portfolio]] as there’s not much reason to trade them. On the other hand, when portfolio managers need to shift their exposure to [[interest rate risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) and find [[arbitrage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp) opportunities, they trade on-the-run Treasuries, creating [[Liquidity|liquidity]] for these securities.

## Off-The-Run [[Yield]] Curves

Although on-the-run [[Treasury Yield|treasury yield]] can be used to construct an [[interpolated yield curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interpolated_yield_curve.asp), which is used to determine the price of [[Debt|debt]] securities, some analysts prefer to use the [[Yield|yield]] of [[Off-The-Run Treasuries|off-the-run Treasuries]] to draw the [[yield curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldcurve.asp). Off-the-run yields are used in cases where the demand for [[On-The-Run Treasuries|on-the-run Treasuries]] are inconsistent, thereby, causing price distortions caused by the fluctuating current demand. By deriving [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] figures from the [[off-the-run Treasury rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/off_the_run_curve.asp), financial analysts can ensure that temporary fluctuations in demand do not skew the yield curve calculations or the pricing of fixed income investments.
