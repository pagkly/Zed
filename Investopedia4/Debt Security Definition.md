[[Debt Security Definition]]
## What Is a [[Debt]] [[Security]]?

A [[Debt|debt]] [[Security|security]] is a [[debt instrument]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtinstrument.asp) that can be bought or sold between two parties and has basic terms defined, such as the notional amount (the amount borrowed), interest rate, and [[maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp) and renewal date.

Examples of [[Debt|debt]] securities include a government bond, corporate bond, certificate of deposit (CD), municipal bond, or [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]]. Debt securities can also come in the form of collateralized securities, such as [[collateralized debt obligations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) (CDOs), collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), mortgage-backed securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), and [[zero-coupon securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Z|z]]/zero-couponbond.asp).1

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Debt]] securities are financial assets that entitle their owners to a stream of interest payments.
-   Unlike [[Equity|equity]] securities, [[Debt|debt]] securities require the borrower to repay the [[Principal|principal]] borrowed.
-   The interest rate for a [[Debt|debt]] [[Security|security]] [[Will|will]] depend on the perceived [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]] of the borrower.
-   Bonds, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, collateralized bonds, and zero-coupon bonds, are a common type of [[Debt|debt]] [[Security|security]].

## How [[Debt]] Securities Work

A [[Debt|debt]] [[Security|security]] is a type of [[financial asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialasset.asp) that is created when one party lends money to another. For example, [[corporate bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp) are debt securities issued by corporations and sold to investors. Investors lend money to corporations in [[Return|return]] for a pre-established number of interest payments, along with the return of their [[Principal|principal]] upon the bond's maturity date.

[Government bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp), on the other hand, are [[Debt|debt]] securities issued by governments and sold to investors. Investors lend money to the government in [[Return|return]] for interest payments (called [[coupon payments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp)) and a return of their [[Principal|principal]] upon the bond's maturity.

[[Debt]] securities are also known as [[fixed-income securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) because they generate a fixed stream of income from their interest payments. Unlike [[Equity|equity]] investments, in which the [[Return|return]] earned by the investor is dependent on the market performance of the equity issuer, debt instruments guarantee that the investor [[Will|will]] receive repayment of their initial [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp), plus a predetermined stream of interest payments.

Of course, this contractual guarantee does not mean that [[Debt|debt]] securities are without [[Risk|risk]], since the issuer of the debt [[Security|security]] could declare [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) or [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on their agreements.

## [[Risk]] of [[Debt]] Securities

Because the borrower is legally required to make these payments, [[Debt|debt]] securities are generally considered to be a less risky form of investment compared to [[equity investments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) such as [[Stocks|stocks]]. Of course, as is always the case in investing, the true [[risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]].asp) of a particular [[Security|security]] [[Will|will]] depend on its specific characteristics.

For instance, a company with a strong [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) operating in a mature marketplace may be less likely to [[Default|default]] on its debts than a startup company operating in an emerging marketplace. In this case, the mature company would likely be given a more favorable credit [[Rating|rating]] by the three major [[credit rating agencies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp): Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s Corporation ([MCO](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=mco)), and [[Fitch Ratings]].

In keeping with the general [[tradeoff between risk and return]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040715/there-positive-[[Correlation|correlation]]-between-[[Risk|risk]]-and-[[Return|return]].asp), companies with higher credit ratings [[Will|will]] usually [[Offer|offer]] lower interest rates on their [[Debt|debt]] securities and vice versa. For example, as of July 29, 2020, the Bloomberg Barclays Indices of U.S. corporate bond yields showed that double-A-rated corporate bonds had an [[average annual yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/average-annual-[[Yield|yield]].asp) of 1.34%, compared to 2.31% for their triple-B-rated counterparts.

Since the double-A [[Rating|rating]] denotes a lower perceived [[Risk|risk]] of credit [[Default|default]], it makes sense that market participants are willing to accept a lower [[yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/[[Yield|yield]].asp) in exchange for these less risky securities.

## [[Debt]] Securities vs. [[Equity]] Securities

[[Equity]] securities represent a claim on the [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) and assets of a corporation, while [[Debt|debt]] securities are investments in debt instruments. For example, [[a stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp) is an equity [[Security|security]], while a bond is a debt security. When an investor buys a corporate bond, they are essentially loaning the corporation money, and have the right to be repaid the [[Principal|principal]] and interest on the bond.

In contrast, when someone buys [[Stock|stock]] from a corporation, they essentially buy a piece of the company. If the company profits, the investor profits as well, but if the company loses money, the stock also loses money.

## Example of a [[Debt]] [[Security]]

Emma recently purchased a home using a [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) from her bank. From Emma’s perspective, the mortgage represents a [[liability]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liability|liability]].asp) that she must service by making regular interest and [[Principal|principal]] payments. From the perspective of her bank, however, Emma’s mortgage [[Loan|loan]] is an asset, a [[Debt|debt]] [[Security|security]] that entitles them to a stream of interest and principal payments.

As with other [[Debt|debt]] securities, Emma’s mortgage agreement with her bank sets out the key terms of the [[Loan|loan]], such as the face value, [[interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp), payment schedule, and maturity date. In this case, the agreement also includes the specific [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp) of the loan, namely the home which she purchased.

As the holder of this [[Debt|debt]] [[Security|security]], Emma’s bank has the option of either continuing to [[Hold|hold]] the asset or selling it on the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp) to a company that might then package the asset into a [[collateralized mortgage obligation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmo.asp) (CMO).
