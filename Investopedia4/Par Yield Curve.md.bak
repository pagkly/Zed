[[Par Yield Curve]]
## What Is a [[Par Yield Curve]]?

A [[Par Yield Curve|par yield curve]] is a graphical representation of the yields of hypothetical [[Treasury securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/073113/introduction-treasury-securities.asp) with prices at par. On the par [[Yield Curve|yield curve]], the [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] [[Will|will]] equal the [[yield to maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldtomaturity.asp) (YTM) of the [[Security|security]], which is why the Treasury bond will trade at [[par]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/par.asp).

The [[par yield curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/par-[[Yield|yield]]-curve.asp) can be compared with the [[spot yield curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spot_rate_yield_curve.asp) and the forward [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] for Treasuries.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Par Yield Curve|par yield curve]] interpolates the [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] for Treasury securities based on all maturities being prices at par value.
-   At par value, the interest rate would need to be identical to the [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] paid on the bond.
-   The par [[Yield|yield]] [[Will|will]] typically fall below both the spot and forward yield curves under normal circumstances.

## Understanding Par [[Yield]] Curves

The [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] is a graph that shows the relationship between interest rates and [[bond yields]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022516/understanding-different-types-bond-yields.asp) of various maturities, ranging from three-month [[Treasury bills]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp) to 30-year [[Treasury bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp). The graph is plotted with the [[Y|y]]-axis depicting interest rates and the x-axis showing the increasing time durations.

Since short-term bonds typically have lower yields than longer-term bonds, the curve slopes upwards to the right. When the [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] is spoken of, this usually refers to the spot [[Yield|yield]] curve, specifically, the spot yield curve for [[risk-free bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskfreeasset.asp). However, there are some instances where another type of yield curve is referred to—the [[Par Yield Curve|par yield curve]].

The [[Par Yield Curve|par yield curve]] graphs the YTM of coupon-paying bonds of different maturity dates. The [[Yield|yield]] to maturity is the [[Return|return]] that a bond investor expects to make assuming the bond [[Will|will]] be held until maturity. A bond that is issued at [[par]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/par.asp) has a YTM that is equal to the [[coupon rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp). As interest rates fluctuate over time, the YTM either increases or decreases to reflect the current interest rate environment.

For example, if interest rates decrease after a bond has been issued, the value of the bond [[Will|will]] increase given that the [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] affixed to the bond is now higher than the interest rate. In this case, the coupon rate will be higher than the YTM. In effect, the YTM is the [[discount rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp) at which the sum of all future cash flows from the bond (that is, coupons and [[Principal|principal]]) is equal to the current price of the bond.

A par [[Yield|yield]] is the [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] at which bond prices are zero. A [[Par Yield Curve|par yield curve]] represents bonds that are trading at par. In other words, the par [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] is a plot of the yield to maturity against [[term to maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termtomaturity.asp) for a group of bonds priced at par. It is used to determine the coupon rate that a new bond with a given maturity [[Will|will]] pay in order to sell at par today. The par yield curve gives a yield that is used to discount multiple cash flows for a coupon-paying bond. It uses the information in the spot yield curve, also known as the zero percent coupon curve, to discount each coupon by the appropriate [[Spot Rate|spot rate]].

Since duration is longer on the spot [[Yield Curve|yield curve]], the curve [[Will|will]] always lie above the [[Par Yield Curve|par yield curve]] when the par [[Yield|yield]] curve is upward sloping, and lie below the par yield curve when the par yield curve is downward sloping.

## Deriving the [[Par Yield Curve]]

Deriving a [[Par Yield Curve|par yield curve]] is one step toward creating a theoretical [[Spot Rate|spot rate]] [[Yield Curve|yield curve]], which is then used to more accurately price a coupon-paying bond. A method known as [[bootstrapping]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrapping.asp) is used to derive the arbitrage-free [[forward interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardrate.asp). Since Treasury bills offered by the government do not have data for every period, the bootstrapping method is used mainly to fill in the missing figures in order to derive the [[Yield|yield]] curve. For example, consider these bonds with face values of $100 and maturities of six months, one year, 18 months, and two years.

Since coupon payments are made semi-annually, the six-month bond has only one payment. Its [[Yield|yield]] is, therefore, equal to the par rate, which is 2%. The one-year bond [[Will|will]] have two payments made after six months. The first payment will be $100 x (0.023/2) = $1.15. This interest payment should be discounted by 2%, which is the [[Spot Rate|spot rate]] for six months. The second payment will be the sum of the coupon payment and [[Principal|principal]] repayment = $1.15 + $100 = $101.15. We need to find the rate at which this payment should be discounted to get a par value of $100. The calculation is:

-   $100 = $1.15/(1 + (0.02/2)) + $101.15/(1 + (x/2)) 2
-   $100 = 1.1386 + $101.15/(1 + (x/2))2
-   $98.86 = $101.15/(1 + (x/2)) 2
-   (1 + (x/2)) 2 = $101.15/$98.86
-   1 + (x/2) = √1.0232
-   x/2 = 1.0115 – 1
-   x = 2.302%

This is the zero-[[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] for a one-year bond or the one-year [[Spot Rate|spot rate]]. We can calculate the spot rate for the other bonds maturing in 18 months and two years using this process.
