[[What Is a Stock Quote]]?
## [[What Is a Stock Quote|What is a Stock Quote]]?

A [[Stock|stock]] [[Quote|quote]] is the price of a stock as quoted on an exchange. A basic quote for a specific stock provides information, such as its bid and ask price, last traded price, and volume traded. Investors increasingly access stock [[quotes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quote.asp) online or on mobile devices, such as smartphones, rather than through print media, such as newspapers and magazines. A large number of Internet portals and websites [[Offer|offer]] delayed stock quotes at no charge, with real-time stock quotes generally restricted to paying subscribers.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Stock|stock]] [[Quote|quote]] is the price of a stock as quoted in decimals on an exchange.
-   It is generally displayed with supplemental information, such as high and low prices for a given [[Security|security]] in a day or its change in value.
-   Pricing displayed with a [[Stock|stock]] [[Quote|quote]] reflects the buying and selling activity that influences the value of a given [[Security|security]].

## Understanding [[Stock]] Quotes

All [[stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp) in the U.S. have been quoted in decimals, rather than fractions, since April 9, 2001. As a result, [[bid-ask spreads]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) have contracted dramatically, with spreads for the most widely traded [[Stocks|stocks]] now as small as a penny, compared with 1/16th of a dollar (or $0.0625) earlier. Decimal pricing has resulted in substantial savings on [[transaction costs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transactioncosts.asp) to U.S. investors because of tighter bid-ask spreads.

## What [[Stock]] Quotes Reveal to Investors

[[Stock]] quotes can be presented with supplemental information and data, such as the high and low prices for given [[Security|security]] that have been recorded over the course of the trading day. The stock [[Quote|quote]] may also show the change in the value of the security compared against the prior day’s [[closing price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp) or the opening price of the current trading day. The difference in prices might be shown as a percentage, revealing how much security has increased or declined in value.

Analyst recommendations for a given [[Security|security]] might also be presented with a [[Stock|stock]] [[Quote|quote]]. Such recommendations could be shown for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly intervals.

Depending on the service and platform providing [[Stock|stock]] quotes, the information might strictly revolve around the current, latest pricing, or there can be expanded details such as metrics on the daily, weekly, monthly, and annual performance of the [[Security|security]]. A stock [[Quote|quote]] can also include performance metrics on share prices for a multiyear period.

The pricing displayed with a [[Stock|stock]] [[Quote|quote]] reflects the buying and selling activity that influences the value of a given [[Security|security]]. As each trading day unfolds, news and industry trends related to a security can affect the way investors choose to handle the [[Shares|shares]]. When beneficial updates are revealed, such as strong revenue and earnings reported by the company or positive test results for a product, the value of the shares can increase as more investors buy into the company. These [[shifts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paradigm-shift.asp) are reflected in the stock quotes that shareholders and other watchers of the company [[Will|will]] use to make investment decisions.

## Example of [[Stock]] [[Quote]]

Consider the [[Stock|stock]] [[Quote|quote]] for [[Social Media|social media]] behemoth Facebook. It is displayed along with supplemental information: the company's ticker symbol (FB), change in price (expressed in terms of percentage), and last [[Quoted Price|quoted price]] at closing time.
