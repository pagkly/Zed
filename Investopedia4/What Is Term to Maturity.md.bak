[[What Is Term to Maturity]]?
## [[What Is Term to Maturity]]?

A bond's term to maturity is the length of time during which the owner [[Will|will]] receive interest payments on the investment. When the bond reaches maturity the [[Principal|principal]] is repaid.

### Key Takeaways

-   A bond's term to maturity is the period during which its owner [[Will|will]] receive interest payments on the investment.
-   When the bond reaches maturity, the owner is repaid its par, or face, value.
-   The term to maturity can change if the bond has a put or call option.

Bonds can be grouped into three broad categories depending on their terms to maturity: [[short term]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortterm.asp) bonds of one to five years, intermediate-term bonds of five to 12 years, and [[long term]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longterm.asp) bonds of 12 to 30 years.

## Understanding Term to Maturity

Generally, the longer the term to maturity is, the higher the interest rate on the bond [[Will|will]] be and the less volatile its price will be on the secondary bond market. Also, the further a bond is from its maturity date, the larger the difference between its [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] and its redemption value, which is also referred to as its [[Principal|principal]], par, or face value.

### Interest Rate [[Risk]]

The interest rate on long-term bonds is higher to compensate for the interest rate [[Risk|risk]] the investor is taking on. The investor is locking in money for the long run, with the risk of missing out on a better [[Return|return]] if interest rates go higher. The investor [[Will|will]] be forced to forego the higher return or sell the bond at a loss in order to reinvest the money at a higher rate.

The term to maturity is one factor in the interest rate paid on a bond. The longer the term, the higher the [[Return|return]].

A short-term bond pays relatively less interest but the investor gains flexibility. The money [[Will|will]] be repaid in a year or less and can be invested at a new, higher, rate of [[Return|return]].

In the secondary market, a bond's value is based on its remaining [[Yield|yield]] to maturity as well as its face, or par, value.

### Why Term to Maturity Can Change

For many bonds, the term to maturity is fixed. However, the term to maturity can be changed if the bond has a call provision, a [[put provision]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put-provision.asp), or a conversion provision:

-   A call provision allows a company to pay off a bond before its term of maturity ends. A company might do this if interest rates decline, making it advantageous to pay off the old bonds and issue a new one at a lower rate of [[Return|return]].
-   A put provision allows the owner to sell the bond back to the company at its face value. An investor might do this to recoup the money for another investment.
-   A conversion provision allows the owner of a bond to convert it into [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock|stock]] in the company.

## An Example of Term to Maturity

The Walt Disney Company raised $7 billion by selling bonds in September 2019.

The company issued new bonds with six terms of maturity in short-term, medium-term and long-term versions. The long-term version was a 30-year bond that pays 0.95% more than the comparable Treasury bonds.
