## What Is the [[Series 6]]?

The [[Series 6]] is a securities license entitling the holder to register as a company's representative and sell certain types of mutual funds, [[variable annuities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variableannuity.asp), and insurance. Holders of the Series 6 license are not authorized to sell corporate or municipal securities, direct participation programs, and options. With Series 6, an individual can purchase or sell certain types of mutual funds, [[Variable Life Insurance|variable life insurance]], municipal fund securities, variable annuities, and unit investment trusts.

-   The greatest disadvantage of a [[Series 6]] license is that holders are not authorized to sell exchange traded funds (ETFs).

## Understanding [[Series 6]]

The [[Series 6]] is a license sought by professionals in the financial services industry. Jobs utilizing the Series 6 license include financial advisors, retirement plan specialists, investment advisors, and private bankers. In order to obtain the Series 6 license, candidates must pass the Investment Company/Variable Contracts Products Limited Representative (Series 6) exam. The [[Securities Industry Essentials]](https://www.investopedia.com/securities-industry-essentials-sie-exam-overview-4692828) (SIE) exam is a corequisite for the Series 6 exam. The SIE does not require firm sponsorship.

The [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp) (FINRA) administers the [[Series 6]] exam. It covers topics such as mutual funds, variable annuities, securities, tax regulations, retirement plans, and insurance products. A passing grade is achieved by correctly answering at least 35 of 50 questions within 90 minutes. Five additional questions are unscored for a total of 55 questions. The test costs $40, and it is administered via computer with no reference material allowed.

Candidates traditionally took [[Series 6]] exams in person at Prometric test centers. However, FINRA began [[Offering|offering]] tests, including the Series 6 exam, online during the coronavirus pandemic. Prometric also administered the online tests. However, candidates or their employers had to install specialized software on their computers and provide cameras.1 Note, however, that a Series 6 expires two years after employment unless under special circumstances such a military deployment.

The availability of online and offline versions of the [[Series 6]] exam was limited during parts of the coronavirus pandemic. That made it crucial to register to take the exam as far in advance as possible.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of [[Series 6]]

The [[Series 6]] exam is often [[compared to the Series 7 exam]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042215/what-are-differences-between-series-6-exam-and-series-7-exam.asp). The Series 6 costs substantially less money and has a shorter test covering less material. However, a Series 6 license is all that some financial advisors, investment advisors, and retirement planners need. Such advisors may only need a Series 6 license if they just sell insurance, annuities, and certain types of mutual funds, not individual [[Stocks|stocks]].

The greatest disadvantage of a [[Series 6]] is that holders are not authorized to sell [[exchange-traded funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (ETFs), or [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds, as they are considered corporate securities. That is a significant drawback because ETFs generally [[Offer|offer]] lower fees and are increasingly replacing mutual funds as the preferred investment vehicles among retail investors. Advisors and retirement planners who want to sell ETFs must obtain a [[Series 7]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series7.asp) license, which requires taking a longer and more comprehensive exam that costs more money.

## Requirements for [[Series 6]]

Candidates must be sponsored by a member of FINRA or a [[self-regulatory organization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sro.asp) (SRO) to take the exam. There is no prerequisite for the exam, but the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam is a corequisite for [[Series 6]]. Before Oct. 2018, the exam was 100 questions and didn't have the SIE corequisite.

Upon receiving a passing grade, candidates must then register with FINRA through their sponsoring firm in order to transact authorized securities. Holders of the [[Series 6]] are considered limited representatives of their sponsoring firm. As a limited representative, they can sell certain types of mutual funds, variable annuities, and [[Variable Life Insurance|variable life insurance]].

### [[Series 6]] Exam

As outlined by FINRA, the [[Series 6]] exam covers four specific sections.2

-   "Seeks Business for the Broker-dealer from Customers and Potential Customers," which is 12 questions—covering 24% of the exam.
-   "Opens Accounts After Obtaining and Evaluating Customers' Financial Profile and Investment Objectives" is eight questions—covering 16% of the exam.
-   "Provides Customers with Information About Investments, Makes Suitable Recommendations, Transfers Assets, and Maintains Appropriate Records" is half the exam at 25 questions—covering 50% of the exam.
-   "Obtains and Verifies Customers' Purchase and Sales Instructions; Processes, Completes, and Confirms Transactions" is five questions—covering 10% of the exam.

### Continuing Education

Licensees must fulfill continuing education requirements and receive sponsorship from a FINRA registered company to keep their [[Series 6]] licenses.3

FINRA’s continuing education program includes two elements: a regulatory element and a firm element. On the regulatory side, FINRA requires licensees to complete a computer-based training session within 120 days of the second anniversary of registration. FINRA also requires a computer-based training session every three years after that. The firm element requires broker-dealers to establish and maintain a continuing [[education program]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionaleducation/07/continuing-education.asp).
