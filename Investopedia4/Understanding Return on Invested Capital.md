[[Understanding Return on Invested Capital]]
## What Is [[Return]] on Invested Capital (ROIC)?

[[Return]] on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. The return on invested capital ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its capital to generate profits.

Comparing a company's [[Return|return]] on invested capital with its [[weighted average cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) (WACC) reveals whether [[invested capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invested-capital.asp) is being used effectively. This measure is also known simply as "return on capital."

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Return]] on invested capital (ROIC) is the amount of money a company makes that is above the average cost it pays for its [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] capital.
-   The [[Return|return]] on invested capital can be used as a benchmark to calculate the value of other companies
-   A company is thought to be creating value if its ROIC exceeds 2% and destroying value if it is less than 2%.

#### The [[Return]] On Invested Capital (ROIC)

## How to Calculate [[Return]] on Invested Capital (ROIC) Is Used

### The formula for ROIC is:

> ROIC = (net income - dividend) / ([[Debt|debt]] + [[Equity|equity]])

The ROIC formula is calculated by assessing the value in the denominator, total capital, which is the sum of a company's [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]]. There are a number of ways to calculate this value. One is to subtract cash and [[non-interest bearing current liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nibcl.asp) (NIBCL)—including tax liabilities and accounts payable, as long as these are not subject to interest or fees—from total assets.

Another, more precise way to write the ROIC formula is:

ROIC\=NOPATInvested Capitalwhere:NOPAT\=Net operating profit after tax\\begin{aligned} &\\text{ROIC} = \\frac{ \\text{NOPAT} }{ \\text{Invested Capital} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{NOPAT} = \\text{Net [[Operating Profit|operating profit]] after tax} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

A third method of calculating invested capital is to add the book value of a company's [[Equity|equity]] to the book value of its [[Debt|debt]], then subtract non-operating assets, including cash and [[Cash Equivalents|cash equivalents]], [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]], and assets of discontinued operations.

Yet another way to calculate invested capital is to obtain working capital by subtracting current liabilities from [[Current Assets|current assets]]. Next, you obtain non-cash working capital by subtracting cash from the working capital value you just calculated. Finally, non-cash working capital is added to a company's [[fixed assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp), also known as long-term or non-current assets.

An ROIC higher than the [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] means a company is healthy and growing, while an ROIC lower than cost of capital suggests an unsustainable business model. 

### Special Considerations 

The value in the numerator can also be calculated in several ways. The most straightforward way is to subtract dividends from a company's net income.

On the other hand, because a company may have benefited from a one-time source of income unrelated to its core business—a windfall from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, for example—it is often preferable to look at [[net operating profit after taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nopat.asp) (NOPAT). NOPAT is calculated by adjusting the [[Operating Profit|operating profit]] for taxes:

> NOPAT = ([[Operating Profit|operating profit]]) \* (1 - [[Effective Tax Rate|effective tax rate]]).

[Operating profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_profit.asp) is also referred to as [[earnings before interest and tax]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT). Many companies [[Will|will]] report their effective tax rates for the quarter or fiscal year in their earnings releases, but not all.

## How to Use ROIC

ROIC is always calculated as a percentage and is usually expressed as an annualized or trailing 12-month value. It should be compared to a company's [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp) to determine whether the company is creating value.

If ROIC is greater than a firm's [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] (WACC), the most common cost of capital metric, value is being created and these firms [[Will|will]] trade at a [[Premium|premium]]. A common benchmark for evidence of value creation is a [[Return|return]] in excess of 2% of the firm's cost of capital.

If a company's ROIC is less than 2%, it is considered a value destroyer. Some firms run at a zero-[[Return|return]] level, and while they may not be destroying value, these companies have no excess capital to invest in future growth.

ROIC is one of the most important and informative valuation metrics to calculate. That said, it is more important for some sectors than others, since companies that operate oil rigs or manufacture semiconductors invest capital much more intensively than those that require less equipment.

## Limitations of [[Return]] on Invested Capital

One downside of this metric is that it tells nothing about what segment of the business is generating value. If you make your calculation based on [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) (minus dividends) instead of NOPAT, the result can be even more opaque, since the [[Return|return]] may derive from a single, non-recurring event.

ROIC provides the necessary context for other metrics such as the [[P/E ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp). Viewed in isolation, the P/E ratio might suggest a company is oversold, but the decline could be due to the fact that the company is no longer generating value for shareholders at the same rate—or at all. On the other hand, companies that consistently generate high rates of [[Return|return]] on invested capital probably deserve to trade at a [[Premium|premium]] to other [[Stocks|stocks]], even if their P/E ratios seem prohibitively high.

## Example of How to Use [[Return]] on Invested Capital

As a historical example, let's consider Target Corp.'s ([TGT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=tgt)) fourth-quarter 2018 earnings release. The company calculated its trailing 12-month month ROIC for that year, showing the components that went into the calculation:

Target Corp. FY 2018 ROIC Calculation

The ROIC calculation begins with earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT), then adds operating [[Lease|lease]] interest and subtracts income taxes, yielding a net profit after taxes of $3.5 billion: this is the numerator.1 Next, add the current portion of long-term [[Debt|debt]] and other borrowings, the non-current portion of [[long-term debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermdebt.asp), shareholders [[Equity|equity]], and capitalized operating lease obligations.

Subtract [[cash and cash equivalents]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashandcashequivalents.asp) and net assets of [[discontinued operations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discontinued-operations.asp), which yields total invested capital of $22.2 billion. Average this figure with the invested capital from the end of the prior-year period ($22.3 billion), and you end up with a denominator of $22.2 billion.

The resulting after-[[Tax Return|tax return]] on invested capital is 15.9%. The company attributed the increase over the previous 12 months largely to the effects of the tax bill passed in late 2017. This calculation would have been difficult to obtain from the income statement and balance sheet alone since the asterisked values are buried in an addendum. For this reason, calculating ROIC can be tricky, but it is worth arriving at a [[ballpark figure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/ballpark-figure.asp) in order to assess a company's efficiency at putting capital to work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is invested capital?

Invested capital is the total amount of money raised by a company by issuing securities ([[Equity|equity]] to shareholders and [[Debt|debt]] to [bondholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp)), where the total debt and capital [lease](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lease|lease]].asp) obligations are added to the amount of equity issued to investors. Invested capital is not a line item in the company's financial statement because debt, capital leases, and stockholder’s equity are each [[Listed|listed]] separately in the balance sheet.

### What does [[Return|return]] on invested capital tell you?

[[Return]] on invested capital (ROIC) assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments or projects. The ROIC ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using the money it has raised externally to generate returns. Comparing a company's return on invested capital with its [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] (WACC) reveals whether invested capital is being used effectively.

### How do you compute ROIC?

ROIC takes into account four key components: operating income, tax rates, book value, and time. The ROIC formula is net [[Operating Profit|operating profit]] after tax (NOPTAT) divided by invested capital. Companies with a steady or improving [[Return|return]] on capital are unlikely to put significant amounts of new capital to work.
