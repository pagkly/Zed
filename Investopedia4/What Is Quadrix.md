[[What Is Quadrix]]?
## [[What Is Quadrix]]

Quadrix is a [[Stock|stock]] [[Rating|rating]] system that uses over 90 variables in seven major categories to determine the value of a stock. The Quadrix system is produced and maintained by Horizon Publishing Company. The seven major categories are [[Momentum|momentum]], quality, value, financial strength, earnings estimates, performance, and reversion. The overall score for a particular stock is determined by a [[Weighted|weighted]] average of all 90 variables.1

The Quadrix system was developed by Horizon Investment Services’ Chief Investment Officer, [[Rich Moroney]](https://www.horizoninvestment.com/team.asp#Moroney) and has been publishing scores for [[Stocks|stocks]] since the year 2000.1

### Key Takeaways

-   Quadrix is a proprietary [[Stock|stock]] screening system.
-   The screener looks at publicly traded [[Stocks|stocks]] in the U.S. including some ADRs of foreign companies [[Listed|listed]] on U.S. exchanges.
-   Quadrix is not a [[Risk|risk]]-based [[Portfolio|portfolio]] builder based on modern portfolio theory of the kind used by many roboadvisors.

## How Quadrix Works

Quadrix is a [[Stock|stock]] evaluation tool that rates [[Stocks|stocks]] based on variable scores that fall into one of seven categories. The seven categories of variables used in Quadrix are [[Momentum|momentum]], quality, value, financial strength, forecasted earnings, performance, and reversion. The Quadrix system can also be used as a tool for tracking industry group performance.

Quadrix is a first [[Stock|stock]] screen for building portfolios. The system looks at the given set of 90 variables in a universe of over 5,000 [[Stocks|stocks]].1 It is intended to narrow the universe of acceptable stocks under consideration by an investor. It is not a [[Risk|risk]]-based [[Portfolio|portfolio]] builder like some robo-advisors.

## Examples and Uses of Quadrix

Quadrix is used in-house by Horizon Publishing to screen [[Stocks|stocks]] for clients, and it is available for subscribers to Horizon's newsletter products. As mentioned above, it is not a [[Risk|risk]]-based [[Portfolio|portfolio]] builder, and it does not rely on [[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) to weight stocks or evaluate risk versus [[Return|return]] for the investor.
