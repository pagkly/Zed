[[What Is Risk Tolerance]]?
## [[What Is Risk Tolerance]]?

[Risk tolerance](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/risk_tolerance.asp) is the degree of [[variability]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variability.asp) in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand in their [[financial planning]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialplanner.asp). [[Risk]] tolerance is an important component in [[investing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investing.asp). You should have a realistic understanding of your ability and willingness to stomach large [[swings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swing.asp) in the value of your investments; if you take on too much risk, you might panic and sell at the wrong time.

[[Risk]] tolerance is often associated with age, although that is not the only determining factor. However, in a general sense, people who are younger and have a longer time horizon are often able to and are encouraged to take on greater risk than people older with a shorter-term horizon. Greater risk tolerance is often synonymous with equities and [[Equity|equity]] funds and ETFs, while lower risk tolerance is often associated with bonds, bond funds, and ETFs. But age itself shouldn't determine a switch in asset classes. Those with a higher [[Net Worth|net worth]] and more disposable income can also typically afford to take greater risks with their investments.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Risk]] tolerance is a measure of how much of a loss an investor is willing to endure within their [[Portfolio|portfolio]].
-   It looks at how much market [[Risk|risk]]—[[Stock|stock]] [[Volatility|volatility]], stock market swings, economic or political events, regulatory, or interest rate changes—an investor can tolerate, considering that all of these factors might cause their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] to slide.
-   A person's age, investment goals, income, and comfort level all play into determining their [[Risk|risk]] tolerance.
-   An aggressive investor, or someone with higher [[Risk|risk]] tolerance, is willing to risk more money for the possibility of better returns than a conservative investor, who has lower tolerance.
-   A person with moderate [[Risk|risk]] tolerance sits in the balance between an aggressive and conservative investor.

## Understanding [[Risk]] Tolerance

[[Risk]] tolerance assessments for investors abound, including risk-related surveys or questionnaires. As an investor, you may also want to review historical worst-case returns for different [[asset classes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) to get an idea of how much money you would feel comfortable losing if your [[investments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp) have a bad year or bad series of years. Other factors affecting risk tolerance are the [[time horizon]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timehorizon.asp) you have to invest, your future earning capacity, and the presence of other assets such as a home, pension, [[Social Security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialsecurity.asp), or an inheritance. In general, you can take greater risk with investable assets when you have other, more stable sources of funds available.

[[Risk]] tolerance is [[different from risk capacity]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/difference-between-risk-tolerance-and-risk-capacity.asp), which refers to the minimum amount of risk an investor has to tolerate in order to reach their investment goals, relative to their time frame and income.

## Aggressive [[Risk]] Tolerance

Aggressive investors tend to be market-savvy. A deep understanding of securities and their propensities allows such individuals and institutional investors to purchase highly volatile instruments, such as small-company [[Stocks|stocks]] that can plummet to zero or options contracts that can expire worthlessly. While maintaining a base of riskless securities, aggressive investors reach for maximum returns with maximum [[Risk|risk]].

## Moderate [[Risk]] Tolerance

Moderate investors [[accept some risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accepting-[[Risk|risk]].asp) to the [[Principal|principal]] but adopt a balanced approach with intermediate-term time horizons of five to 10 years. Combining large-company mutual funds with less volatile bonds and riskless securities, moderate investors often pursue a 50/50 structure. A typical strategy might involve investing half of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] in a dividend-paying, [[Growth Fund|growth fund]].

## Conservative [[Risk]] Tolerance

Conservative investors are willing to accept little to no [[Volatility|volatility]] in their investment portfolios. Often, retirees who have spent decades building a nest egg are unwilling to allow any type of [[Risk|risk]] to their [[Principal|principal]]. A conservative investor targets vehicles that are guaranteed and highly liquid. Risk-averse individuals opt for bank certificates of deposit (CDs), money markets, or U.S. Treasuries for income and preservation of capital.
