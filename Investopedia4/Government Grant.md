[[Government Grant]]
## What Is a [[Government Grant]]?

A [[Government Grant|government grant]] is a financial award given by a federal, state, or local government authority for a beneficial project. It is effectively a [[transfer payment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transferpayment.asp). A [[Grant|grant]] does not include technical assistance or other financial assistance, such as a [[Loan|loan]] or loan guarantee, an interest rate [[subsidy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp), direct [[appropriation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appropriation.asp), or revenue sharing. The [[Grantee|grantee]] is not expected to repay the money but is expected to use the funds from the grant for their stated purpose, which typically serves some larger good.

In certain cases, there may also be revenue-sharing agreements with the government—for instance, in the case of a discovery that leads to a profit-generating patent.

Twenty-six [[federal agencies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-agencies.asp) administer more than 1,000 [[Grant|grant]] programs annually to provide funding for the arts, the sciences, and educational institutions.12 Government grants help fund ideas and projects providing public services and stimulating the economy. For example, an [[Economics|economics]] program may be designed to strengthen empirical and theoretical [[economic analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bea.asp), as well as the methods for rigorous research on economic behavior.

Grants may also support critical recovery initiatives, agricultural projects, and innovative research in all sorts of fields.

## How a [[Government Grant]] Works

Government grants aren't just bestowed: they must be applied for. Getting a [[Government Grant|government grant]] is an extremely competitive process. The paperwork is complex and applicants must describe how the awarded funds [[Will|will]] benefit the local community or the public at large. Crafting a convincing proposal is so challenging that applicants often hire professional help. Some freelance writers specialize in writing [[Grant|grant]] proposals.

The [[Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/catalog-of-federal-domestic-assistance-cfda.asp), published annually, offers a list of available grants and [[Grant|grant]] programs, and the agencies sponsoring them. Grants from the federal government are authorized and appropriated through bills passed by Congress and signed by the president. Grant authority varies among agencies. For example, the [[Small Business Administration (SBA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-business-administration.asp) may distribute grants to nonprofit organizations in many of its counseling and training programs.

## Receiving a [[Government Grant]]

Government grants have no hidden costs or fees: they are outright gifts, not loans. However, because government grants are funded by tax dollars, they include stringent compliance and reporting measures to ensure the money is well-spent.

After receiving a check, the [[Grantee|grantee]] must submit detailed reports accounting for how the money is disbursed. If the funds are received in stages, these reports must continue during the [[Grant|grant]] period. Any accomplishments or failures also must be documented and submitted to the sponsoring agency according to various deadlines.3

Receiving a [[Government Grant|government grant]] is a prestigious event, a sign an individual or [[nonprofit organization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-profitorganization.asp) has a significant, positive impact on a community or in a field of study or industrial sector. Often, it puts a project on the donor map, attracting other providers of funding, both nonprofit and profit. It also might lend the [[Grantee|grantee]] some influence with, or attention from, the sponsoring agency.

## Applying for a [[Government Grant]]

[Grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants) is a free online source for researching and applying for more than 1,000 federal [[Grant|grant]] programs with access to approximately $500 billion in awards annually.1 A grant proposal writer may register by completing a standard business profile on behalf of an individual, a nonprofit organization, a research institution, or a similar entity.

The writer also submits an authorized organization representative application, supplies an e-business point of contact, and completes a detailed application. The writer then has access to finding federal [[Grant|grant]] opportunities, applying for and tracking grants, and receiving grant email alerts, webinar schedules, and tips from grantors.4

Government grants come with no strings, and that includes the application process, so if you are asked to submit a fee to apply or to learn more about a [[Grant|grant]], there’s a good chance it is a scam.

## Example of a [[Government Grant]]

The [[performing arts]](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html?keywords=performing%20arts) is one popular category for many government agencies awarding grants. For example, in early 2019 the U.S. Embassy’s Public Affairs Section in Moscow sought [[Grant|grant]] applications to identify and select American artists and performers to bring to Russia for short-term programs in the fields of music, dance, theater, film and television acting, and culinary arts.5

Eligible applicants could include nonprofits, small businesses, and public or private universities; grantees could receive up to $650,000 to produce performances in Russia. The goals of the [[Grant|grant]] included strengthening "people-to-people ties" between the U.S. and Russia and "showcasing American values by presenting the full range of American creativity and innovation."5
