# [[Nonperforming Loan – NPL]] – Definition

> ## Excerpt
> A nonperforming [[Loan|loan]] (NPL) is a sum of borrowed money whose scheduled payments have not been made by the [[Debtor|debtor]] for a specified period of time – usually 90 or 180 days. It is considered in [[Default|default]] or near default.

[[Nonperforming Loan – NPL]]
## What Is a Nonperforming [[Loan]]?

A nonperforming [[Loan|loan]] (NPL) is a loan in which the borrower is in [[Default|default]] due to the fact that they have not made the scheduled payments for a specified period. Although the exact elements of nonperforming status can vary depending on the specific loan's terms, "no payment" is usually defined as zero payments of either [[Principal|principal]] or interest. The specified period also varies, depending on the industry and the type of loan. Generally, however, the period is 90 days or 180 days.

### Key Takeaways

-   A nonperforming [[Loan|loan]] (NPL) is a loan in which the borrower is [[Default|default]] and hasn't made any scheduled payments of [[Principal|principal]] or interest for some time.
-   In banking, commercial loans are considered nonperforming if the borrower is 90 days [[Past Due|past due]].
-   The International Monetary Fund considers loans that are less than 90 days [[Past Due|past due]] as nonperforming if there's high uncertainty surrounding future payments.

## How a Nonperforming [[Loan]] Works

A nonperforming [[Loan|loan]] (NPL) is considered in [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) or close to [[Default|default]]. Once a loan is nonperforming, the odds the [[Debtor|debtor]] [[Will|will]] repay it in full are substantially lower. If the debtor resumes payments again on an NPL, it becomes a [[reperforming loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reperforming-loan.asp), even if the debtor has not caught up on all the missed payments.

In banking, commercial loans are considered nonperforming if the [[Debtor|debtor]] has made zero payments of interest or [[Principal|principal]] within 90 days, or is 90 days [[Past Due|past due]]. For a consumer [[Loan|loan]], 180 days past due classifies it as an NPL.

A [[Loan|loan]] is in arrears when [principal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) or [interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp) payments are late or missed. A loan is in [[Default|default]] when the [[Lender|lender]] considers the loan agreement to be broken and the [[Debtor|debtor]] is unable to meet his obligations.

## Types of Nonperforming Loans

A [[Debt|debt]] can achieve "nonperforming [[Loan|loan]]" status in several ways. Examples of NPLs include:

-   A [[Loan|loan]] in which 90 days' worth of interest has been capitalized, refinanced, or delayed due to an agreement or an amendment to the original agreement.
-   A [[Loan|loan]] in which payments are less than 90 days late, but the [[Lender|lender]] no longer believes the [[Debtor|debtor]] [[Will|will]] make future payments.
-   A [[Loan|loan]] in which the maturity date of [[Principal|principal]] repayment has occurred, but some fraction of the loan remains outstanding.

## Official Definitions of Nonperforming Loans

Several international financial authorities [[Offer|offer]] specific guidelines for determining nonperforming loans.

### The European Central Bank

The [[European Central Bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeancentralbank.asp) (ECB) requires asset and definition comparability to evaluate [[Risk|risk]] exposures across euro area [[central banks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp). The ECB specifies multiple criteria that can cause an NPL classification when it performs stress tests on participating banks.

The ECB has performed a comprehensive assessment and developed criteria to define loans as nonperforming if they are:

-   90 days [[Past Due|past due]], even if they are not defaulted or impaired
-   Impaired with respect to the accounting specifics for [[U.S. GAAP]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) and [[International Financial Reporting Standards]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ifrs.asp) (IFRS) banks
-   In [[Default|default]] according to the Capital Requirements Regulation

An [[addendum]](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2018/html/ssm.pr180315.en.html), issued in 2018, specified the time frame for lenders to set aside funds to cover nonperforming loans: two to seven years, depending on whether the [[Loan|loan]] was secured or not. As of 2020, [[Eurozone|eurozone]] lenders still have approximately $1 trillion worth of nonperforming loans on their books.

A nonperforming [[Loan|loan]] (NPL) is one in which payments of either interest or [[Principal|principal]] have not been made for a set number of days, for whatever reason.

### The International Money Fund Definition

The [[International Monetary Fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imf.asp) (IMF) also sets out multiple criteria for a [[nonperforming loan classification]](https://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/fsi/eng/2003/051403bp.pdf).

The IMF has defined nonperforming loans as those whose:\[[cite](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2005/05-29.pdf)\]

-   Debtors have not paid interest and/or [[Principal|principal]] payments in at least 90 days or more
-   Interest payments equal to 90 days or more have been capitalized, refinanced, or delayed by agreement
-   Payments have been delayed by less than 90 days, but come with high uncertainty or no certainty the [[Debtor|debtor]] [[Will|will]] make payments in the future
