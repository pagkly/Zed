[[Understanding the Times Interest Earned (TIE) Ratio]]
## What Is the Times Interest Earned Ratio?

The times interest earned (TIE) ratio is a measure of a company's ability to meet its [[Debt|debt]] obligations based on its current income. The formula for a company's TIE number is earnings before interest and taxes [(EBIT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) divided by the total interest payable on bonds and other debt.

The result is a number that shows how many times a company could cover its interest charges with its pretax earnings.

TIE is also referred to as the interest [[Coverage Ratio|coverage ratio]].

#### Times Interest Earned (TIE)

### Key Takeaways

-   A company's TIE indicates its ability to pay its debts.
-   A better TIE number means a company has enough cash after paying its debts to continue to invest in the business.
-   The formula for TIE is calculated as earnings before interest and taxes divided by total interest payable on [[Debt|debt]].

## [[Understanding the Times Interest Earned (TIE) Ratio]]

Obviously, no company needs to cover its debts several times over in order to survive. However, the TIE ratio is an indication of a company's relative freedom from the constraints of [[Debt|debt]]. Generating enough [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] to continue to invest in the business is better than merely having enough money to stave off bankruptcy.

A company's capitalization is the amount of money it has raised by issuing [[Stock|stock]] or [[Debt|debt]], and those choices impact its TIE ratio. Businesses consider the [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp) for stock and debt and use that cost to make decisions.

### How to Calculate Times Interest Earned (TIE)

Assume, for example, that XYZ Company has $10 million in 4% [[Debt|debt]] outstanding and $10 million in [[Common Stock|common stock]]. The company needs to raise more capital to purchase equipment. The [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] for issuing more debt is an annual interest rate of 6%. The company's shareholders expect an annual dividend payment of 8% plus growth in the [[Stock|stock]] price of XYZ.

Companies that have consistent earnings, like utilities, tend to borrow more because they are [[Good Credit|good credit]] risks.

The business decides to issue $10 million in additional [[Debt|debt]]. Its total annual interest expense [[Will|will]] be: (4% X $10 million) + (6% X $10 million), or $1 million annually. The company's [[EBIT]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/ebitda.asp) is $3 million.

This means that the TIE ratio for XYZ Company is 3, or three times the annual interest expense.

### Factoring in Consistent Earnings

As a rule, companies that generate consistent annual earnings are likely to carry more [[Debt|debt]] as a percentage of total capitalization. If a [[Lender|lender]] sees a history of generating consistent earnings, the firm [[Will|will]] be considered a better credit [[Risk|risk]].

Utility companies, for example, generate consistent earnings. Their product is not an optional expense for consumers or businesses. Some utility companies raise 60% or more of their capital by issuing [[Debt|debt]].

Startup firms and businesses that have inconsistent earnings, on the other hand, raise most or all of the capital they use by issuing [[Stock|stock]]. Once a company establishes a track record of producing reliable earnings, it may begin raising capital through [[Debt|debt]] offerings as well.
