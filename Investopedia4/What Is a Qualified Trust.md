[[What Is a Qualified Trust]]?
## [[What Is a Qualified Trust]]?

A qualified trust is a tax-advantaged [[fiduciary]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Fiduciary|fiduciary]].asp) relationship between an employer and an employee in the form of a [[Stock|stock]] bonus, pension, or [[profit-sharing plan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitsharingplan.asp). In a qualified trust, the [[Underlying|underlying]] beneficiary may use his or her [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] to determine required minimum distribution (RMD) amounts, but other considerations like gender, race, or salary cannot be used.

### Key Takeaways

-   A qualified trust is a [[Stock|stock]] bonus, pension, or [[Profit-Sharing Plan|profit-sharing plan]] established by an employer for their employees.
-   A qualified trust is tax-advantaged as long as it meets IRS requirements.
-   In order to determine benefits, an employer may consider the [[Life Expectancy|life expectancy]] of their employees, but they cannot factor in the race, gender, religion, or current compensation of their employees.

## Understanding Qualified Trusts

A trust may be "qualified" or "non-qualified," according to the IRS. A qualified plan carries certain tax benefits. To be qualified, a trust must be valid under state law and must have identifiable beneficiaries. In addition, the IRA [[Trustee|trustee]], custodian, or plan administrator must receive a copy of the trust instrument. If a qualified trust is not structured correctly, disbursements are taxable by the IRS. [[Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060215/what-are-irs-guidelines-401a.asp) authorizes and sets forth the requirements for what is considered a qualified trust.

Stipulations exist to be sure that an employer does not discriminate among employees when contributing to a qualified trust. For example, an employer may not discriminate in favor of employees that are more highly compensated. Contributions must be uniform across an organization.

## Other Types of Trusts

In addition to qualified trusts, there is a myriad of other trust types.

### Charitable Lead Trust

In a [[charitable lead trust]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/charitableleadtrust.asp), for example, beneficiaries are able to reduce their [[Taxable Income|taxable income]] by donating a portion of the trust's income to charity. After a specified period of time, the remainder of the trust is transferred to the beneficiaries.

### Bare Trust

In a [[bare trust]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bare-trust.asp), a beneficiary has the absolute right to the capital and assets within the trust, as well as the income these assets generate, such as dividends. While a [[Trustee|trustee]] [[Will|will]] often bear responsibility for managing the trust assets in a prudent manner, the trustee does not determine how or when the trust's capital or income is distributed.

### Personal Trust

A [[personal trust]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-trust.asp) is a type of trust that a person sets up for himself or herself as the beneficiary. As separate legal entities, personal trusts that have the authority to buy, sell, [[Hold|hold]], and manage the property for the benefit of their [[trustor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustor.asp) and can accomplish a variety of important objectives. For example, a young adult may set up a personal trust to pay for a graduate school program or professional education down the line.

When setting up any trust, it is important to seek the support of a trust or [[Estate|estate]] lawyer, potentially a [[custodian]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/custodian.asp) to [[Hold|hold]] the assets, and possibly an [[investment advisor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentadvisor.asp) to manage your trust(s) until it's time for withdrawal.
