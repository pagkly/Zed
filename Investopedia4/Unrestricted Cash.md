[[Unrestricted Cash]]
## What is [[Unrestricted Cash]]

[[Unrestricted Cash|Unrestricted cash]] refers to monetary reserves that are not tied to a particular use. Unrestricted cash can be used for any purpose since it is not earmarked for a specific use and is extremely liquid. Often, in order to satisfy [[Debt|debt]] [[covenants]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp), firms [[Will|will]] have to maintain a certain level of cash on their [[balance sheets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) â€” the amount that exceeds the requirements is referred to as unrestricted cash.

[[Unrestricted Cash|Unrestricted cash]] is a part of an organization's liquid funds. An organization's liquid funds include [[restricted cash]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-cash.asp), unrestricted cash, [[Cash Equivalents|cash equivalents]], unrestricted [[short-term]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortterm.asp) (ST) investments, plus net short-term borrowing capacity.

## Breaking Down [[Unrestricted Cash]]

Cash and [[cash equivalents]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashequivalents.asp) represent the money that an organization can spend now, as they are assets readily available for use. In order to spend more than that, a company [[Will|will]] have to take on a higher level of liabilities through borrowing, such as through loans or accounts receivable. For some organizations with a varying pattern of [[cash flow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp), such as non-profits, [[Unrestricted Cash|unrestricted cash]] can keep operations active even when funding sources dry up.

## Example of [[Unrestricted Cash]]

For example, XYZ Corporation makes widgets. They recently issued [[Debt|debt]] to raise capital for a new widget press. The debt covenant surrounding the [[New Issue|new issue]] specifies that XYZ Corporation has to keep $300 million in cash on hand at all times. The cash specified by the debt covenant is [[Restricted Cash|restricted cash]]. Cash XYZ Corporation has on the books beyond the $300 million and beyond what is committed to other projects is [[Unrestricted Cash|unrestricted cash]].
