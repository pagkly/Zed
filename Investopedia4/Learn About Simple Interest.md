[[Learn About Simple Interest]]
## What Is Simple Interest?

Simple interest is a quick and easy method of calculating the interest charge on a [[Loan|loan]]. Simple interest is determined by multiplying the daily [[interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) by the [[Principal|principal]] by the number of days that elapse between payments.

This type of interest usually applies to automobile loans or short-term loans, although some [[mortgages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) use this calculation method.

### Key Takeaways

-   Simple interest is calculated by multiplying the daily interest rate by the [[Principal|principal]], by the number of days that elapse between payments.
-   Simple interest benefits consumers who pay their loans on time or early each month.
-   Auto loans and short-term personal loans are usually simple interest loans.

#### Understanding Simple Interest

## Understanding Simple Interest

When you make a payment on a simple interest [[Loan|loan]], the payment first goes toward that month’s interest, and the remainder goes toward the [[Principal|principal]]. Each month’s interest is paid in full so it never [[accrues]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrue.asp). In contrast, [[compound interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020614/learn-simple-and-compound-interest.asp) adds some of the monthly interest back onto the loan; in each succeeding month, you pay new interest on old interest.

To understand how simple interest works, consider an automobile [[Loan|loan]] that has a $15,000 [[Principal|principal]] balance and an annual 5% simple interest rate. If your payment is due on May 1 and you pay it precisely on the due date, the [[Finance|finance]] company calculates your interest on the 30 days in April. Your interest for 30 days is $61.64 under this scenario. However, if you make the payment on April 21, the finance company charges you interest for only 20 days in April, dropping your interest payment to $41.09, a $20 savings.

### The Formula for Simple Interest Is

Simple Interest\=P×I×Nwhere:P\=principleI\=daily interest rateN\=number of days between payments\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Simple Interest} = P \\times I \\times N\\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &P = \\text{principle} \\\\ &I = \\text{daily interest rate} \\\\ &N = \\text{number of days between payments} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

### Example

Generally, simple interest paid or received over a certain period is a [fixed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp) percentage of the [[Principal|principal]] amount that was borrowed or lent. For example, say a student obtains a simple-interest [[Loan|loan]] to pay one year of college tuition, which costs $18,000, and the annual [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) on the loan is 6%. The student repays the loan over three years. The amount of simple interest paid is:

$3,240\=$18,000×0.06×3\\begin{aligned} &\\$3,240 = \\$18,000 \\times 0.06 \\times 3 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

and the total amount paid is:

$21,240\=$18,000+$3,240\\begin{aligned} &\\$21,240 = \\$18,000 + \\$3,240 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

## Who Benefits From a Simple Interest [[Loan]]?

Because simple interest is often calculated on a daily basis, it mostly benefits consumers who pay their loans on time or early each month. Under the scenario above, if you sent a $300 payment on May 1, then $238.36 goes toward [[Principal|principal]]. If you sent the same payment on April 20, then $258.91 goes toward principal. If you can pay early every month, your principal balance shrinks faster, and you pay the [[Loan|loan]] off sooner than the original estimate.

Conversely, if you pay the [[Loan|loan]] late, more of your payment goes toward interest than if you pay on time. Using the same automobile loan example, if your payment is due on May 1 and you make it on May 16, you get charged for 45 days of interest at a cost of $92.46. This means only $207.54 of your $300 payment goes toward [[Principal|principal]]. If you consistently pay late over the life of a loan, your final payment [[Will|will]] be larger than the original estimate because you did not pay down the principal at the expected rate.

## What Types of Loans Use Simple Interest?

Simple interest [[usually applies]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/101315/4-ways-simple-interest-used-real-life.asp) to automobile loans or short-term [[personal loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-personal-loans-4773300). Most mortgages do not use simple interest, although some banks use this method for mortgages for bi-weekly payment plans. Bi-weekly plans generally help consumers pay off their mortgages early because the borrowers make two extra payments a year, saving interest over the life of the [[Loan|loan]] by paying off the [[Principal|principal]] faster.

If you're looking to take out a short-term personal [[Loan|loan]], then a [[personal loan calculator]](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-loan-calculator-5082130) can be a great tool for determining an interest rate that's within your means.

## Simple Interest vs. [[Compound Interest]]

[Interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp) is the cost of borrowing money, where the borrower pays a fee to the [lender](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) for the [[Loan|loan]]. The interest, typically expressed as a percentage, can be either simple or compounded. Simple interest is based on the [principal amount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) of a loan or deposit. [[Compound interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp), on the other hand, is based on the principal amount and the interest that accumulates on it in every period. Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount of a loan or deposit, so it is easier to determine than [[Compound Interest|compound interest]].

In real-life situations, [[Compound Interest|compound interest]] is often a factor in business transactions, investments, and financial products intended to extend for multiple periods or years. Simple interest is mainly used for easy calculations: those generally for a single period or less than a year, though they also apply to open-ended situations, such as credit card balances.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is simple interest "simple"?

"Simple" interest refers to the straightforward crediting of cash flows associated with some investment or deposit. For instance 1% annual simple interest would credit $1 for every $100 invested. Simple interest does not, however, take into account the power of compounding, or [[interest-on-interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestoninterest.asp), where after the first year the 1% would actually be earned on the $101 balance.

### Which [[Will|will]] pay out more over time, simple or [[Compound Interest|compound interest]]?

[[Compound Interest|Compound interest]] [[Will|will]] always pay more after the first payment period. Suppose you borrow $10,000 at a 10% annual interest rate with the [[Principal|principal]] and [interest due](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest-due.asp) as a [lump sum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lump-sum-payment.asp) in three years. Using a simple interest calculation, 10% of the principal balance gets added to your repayment amount during each of the three years. That comes out to $1,000 per year, which totals $3,000 in interest over the life of the [[Loan|loan]]. At repayment, then, the amount due is $13,000. Now suppose you take out the same loan, with the same terms, but the interest is compounded annually. When the loan is due, instead of owing $13,000, you end up owing $13,310. While you may not consider $310 a huge difference, this example is only a three-year loan; compound interest piles up and becomes oppressive with longer loan terms.

### What are some financial instruments that use simple interest?

Most coupon-paying bonds utilize simple interest. So do most personal loans, including student loans, auto loans and home mortgages.

### What are some financial instruments that instead use [[Compound Interest|compound interest]]?

Most bank deposit accounts, credit cards, and some lines of credit [[Will|will]] tend to use [[Compound Interest|compound interest]].
