[[What You Should Know About Non-Recourse Debt]]
## What Is Non-Recourse [[Debt]]?

Non-recourse [[Debt|debt]] is a type of [[Loan|loan]] secured by [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp), which is usually property. If the borrower defaults, the issuer can seize the collateral but cannot seek out the borrower for any further compensation, even if the collateral does not cover the full value of the defaulted amount. This is one instance where the borrower does not have personal [[Liability|liability]] for the loan.

## Understanding Non-Recourse [[Debt]]

Because in many cases the resale value of the [[Collateral|collateral]] can dip below the [[Loan|loan]] balance over the course of the loan, non-recourse [[Debt|debt]] is riskier to the [[Lender|lender]] than recourse debt.

### Key Takeaways

-   Non-recourse [[Debt|debt]] is a type of [[Loan|loan]] that is secured by [[Collateral|collateral]], which is usually property.Â 
-   Lenders charge higher interest rates on non-recourse [[Debt|debt]] to compensate for the elevated [[Risk|risk]] (i.e., the [[Collateral|collateral]]'s value dipping below the amount owed on the [[Loan|loan]]).
-   Non-recourse [[Debt|debt]] is characterized by high capital expenditures, long [[Loan|loan]] periods, and uncertain revenue streams.
-   [[Loan]]-to-value ratios are usually limited to 60% in non-recourse loans.

Recourse [[Debt|debt]] allows the [[Lender|lender]] to go after the borrower for any balance that remains after liquidating the [[Collateral|collateral]]. For this reason, lenders charge higher interest rates on non-recourse debt to compensate for the elevated [[Risk|risk]].

## Recourse vs. Non-recourse [[Debt]]

Recourse [[Debt|debt]] gives the [[Creditor|creditor]] full autonomy to pursue the borrower for the total debt owed in the event of [[Default|default]]. After liquidating the [[Collateral|collateral]], any balance that remains is known as a deficiency balance. The [[Lender|lender]] may attempt to collect this balance by several means, including filing a lawsuit and obtaining a [[deficiency judgment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficiency-judgment.asp) in court. If the debt is non-recourse, the lender may [[Liquidate|liquidate]] the collateral but may not attempt to collect the deficiency balance.

With non-recourse [[Debt|debt]], the [[Creditor|creditor]]'s only protection against borrower [[Default|default]] is the ability to seize the [[Collateral|collateral]] and [[Liquidate|liquidate]] it to cover the debt owed.

For example, consider an auto [[Lender|lender]] who loans a customer $30,000 to purchase a new vehicle. New cars are notorious for declining precipitously in value the minute they are driven off the lot. When the borrower stops making [[car payments]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/061615/how-interest-rates-work-car-loans.asp) six months into the [[Loan|loan]], the vehicle is only worth $22,000, yet the borrower still owes $28,000.

The [[Lender|lender]] repossesses the car and liquidates it for its full market value, leaving a deficiency balance of $6,000. Most car loans are recourse loans, meaning the lender can pursue the borrower for the $6,000 deficiency balance. In the event it is a non-recourse [[Loan|loan]], the lender forfeits this sum.

## Special Considerations

Non-recourse [[Debt|debt]] is characterized by high capital expenditures, long [[Loan|loan]] periods, and uncertain revenue streams. Underwriting these loans requires financial modeling skills and sound knowledge of the [[Underlying|underlying]] technical domain. Lenders impose higher credit standards on borrowers to minimize the chance of [[Default|default]]. Non-recourse loans, on account of their greater [[Risk|risk]], carry higher interest rates than recourse loans.
