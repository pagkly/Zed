[[Modified Duration]]
## What Is [[Modified Duration]]?

[[Modified Duration|Modified duration]] is a formula that expresses the measurable change in the value of a [[Security|security]] in response to a change in interest rates. Modified duration follows the concept that interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions. This formula is used to determine the effect that a 100-basis-point (1%) change in [[interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) [[Will|will]] have on the price of a bond.

## Formula and Calculation of [[Modified Duration]]

Modified Duration\=Macauley Duration1+YTMnwhere:Macauley Duration\=[[Weighted|weighted]] average term tomaturity of the cash flows from a bondYTM\=[[Yield|yield]] to maturityn\=number of coupon periods per year\\begin{aligned} &\\text{[[Modified Duration]]} = \\frac{ \\text{Macauley Duration} }{ 1 + \\frac{ \\text{YTM} }{ n } } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{Macauley Duration} = \\text{weighted average term to}\\\\ &\\text{maturity of the cash flows from a bond} \\\\ &\\text{YTM} = \\text{yield to maturity} \\\\ &n = \\text{number of coupon periods per year} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

[[Modified Duration|Modified duration]] is an [[extension]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051415/what-difference-between-macaulay-duration-and-modified-duration.asp) of the [[Macaulay duration]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macaulayduration.asp), which allows investors to measure the sensitivity of a bond to changes in interest rates. Macaulay duration calculates the [[Weighted|weighted]] average time before a bondholder receives the bond's cash flows. In order to calculate modified duration, the Macaulay duration must first be calculated. The formula for the Macaulay duration is:

Macauley Duration\=∑t\=1n(PV×CF)×TMarket Price of Bondwhere:PV×CF\=present value of coupon at period tT\=time to each cash flow in yearsn\=number of coupon periods per year\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Macauley Duration} = \\frac{ \\sum\_{t=1}^{n} ( \\text{PV} \\times \\text{CF} ) \\times \\text{T} }{ \\text{Market Price of Bond} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{PV} \\times \\text{CF} = \\text{present value of coupon at period } t \\\\ &\\text{T} = \\text{time to each [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] in years} \\\\ &n = \\text{number of coupon periods per year} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Here, (PV) \* (CF) is the [[present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp) of a coupon at period t and T is equal to the time to each [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] in years. This calculation is performed and summed for the number of periods to maturity.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Modified Duration|Modified duration]] measures the change in the value of a bond in response to a change in 100-basis-point (1%) change in interest rates.
-   [[Modified Duration|Modified duration]] is an extension of the Macaulay duration, and in order to calculate modified duration, the Macaulay duration must first be calculated.
-   Macaulay duration calculates the [[Weighted|weighted]] average time before a bondholder receives the bond's cash flows.
-   As a bond's maturity increases, duration increases, and as a bond's coupon and interest rate increases, its duration decreases.

## What [[Modified Duration]] Can Tell You

[[Modified Duration|Modified duration]] measures the average cash-[[Weighted|weighted]] [[term to maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termtomaturity.asp) of a bond. It is a very important number for [[Portfolio|portfolio]] managers, [[financial advisors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-advisor.asp), and clients to consider when selecting investments because—all other [[Risk|risk]] factors equal—bonds with higher durations have greater price [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) than bonds with lower durations. There are many types of duration, and all components of a bond, such as its price, coupon, maturity date, and interest rates, are used to calculate duration.

Here are some principles of duration to keep in mind. First, as maturity increases, duration increases and the bond becomes more volatile. Second, as a bond's coupon increases, its duration decreases and the bond becomes less volatile. Third, as interest rates increase, duration decreases, and the bond's sensitivity to further interest rate increases goes down.

## Example of How to Use [[Modified Duration]]

Assume a $1,000 bond has a three-year maturity, pays a 10% coupon, and that interest rates are 5%. This bond, following the basic bond pricing formula would have a market price of:

Market Price\=$1001.05+$1001.052+$1,1001.053Market Price\=$95.24+$90.70+$950.22Market Price\=$1,136.16\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Market Price} = \\frac{ \\$100 }{ 1.05 } + \\frac{ \\$100 }{ 1.05 ^ 2 } + \\frac{ \\$1,100 }{ 1.05 ^ 3 } \\\\ &\\phantom{\\text{Market Price} } = \\$95.24 + \\$90.70 + \\$950.22\\\\ &\\phantom{\\text{Market Price} } = \\$1,136.16 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Next, using the Macaulay duration formula, the duration is calculated as:

Macauley Duration\= ($95.24×1$1,136.16)+Macauley Duration = ($90.70×2$1,136.16)+Macauley Duration = ($950.22×3$1,136.16)Macauley Duration\= 2.753\\begin{aligned} \\text{Macauley Duration} =& \\ ( \\$95.24 \\times \\frac{ 1 }{ \\$1,136.16 } ) + \\\\ \\phantom{\\text{Macauley Duration =} }& \\ ( \\$90.70 \\times \\frac{ 2 }{ \\$1,136.16} ) + \\\\ \\phantom{\\text{Macauley Duration =} }& \\ ( \\$950.22 \\times \\frac{ 3 }{ \\$1,136.16} ) \\\\ \\phantom{\\text{Macauley Duration} } =& \\ 2.753 \\end{aligned}

This result shows that it takes 2.753 years to recoup the true cost of the bond. With this number, it is now possible to calculate the [[Modified Duration|modified duration]].

To find the [[Modified Duration|modified duration]], all an investor needs to do is take the Macaulay duration and divide it by 1 + ([[Yield|yield]]-to-maturity / number of coupon periods per year). In this example that calculation would be 2.753 / (1.05 / 1), or 2.62%. This means that for every 1% movement in interest rates, the bond in this example would inversely move in price by 2.62%.
