[[Total Return Swap]]
## What Is a [[Total Return Swap]]?

A [[Total Return Swap|total return swap]] is a [[Swap|swap]] agreement in which one party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the [[Return|return]] of an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset, which includes both the income it generates and any [[capital gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp). In total return swaps, the underlying asset, referred to as the reference asset, is usually an [[Equity|equity]] index, a basket of loans, or bonds. The asset is owned by the party receiving the set rate payment.

### Key Takeaways

-   In a [[Total Return Swap|total return swap]], one party makes payments according to a set rate, while another party makes payments based on the rate of an [[Underlying|underlying]] or reference asset.
-   Total [[Return|return]] swaps permit the party receiving the total return to benefit from the reference asset without owning it.
-   The receiving party also collects any income generated by the asset but, in exchange, must pay a set rate over the life of the [[Swap|swap]].
-   The receiver assumes systematic and credit risks, whereas the payer assumes no performance [[Risk|risk]] but takes on the credit exposure the receiver may be subject to.

## Understanding Total [[Return]] Swaps

A [[Total Return Swap|total return swap]] allows the party receiving the [[total return]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121015/[[Yield|yield]]-vs-total-[[Return|return]]-how-they-differ-and-how-use-them.asp) to [[Gain|gain]] exposure and benefit from a reference asset without actually owning it. These swaps are popular with [[Hedge|hedge]] funds because they provide the benefit of a large exposure to an asset with a minimal cash outlay. The two parties involved in a total return [[Swap|swap]] are known as the total return payer and the total return receiver.

A [[Total Return Swap|total return swap]] is similar to a bullet [[Swap|swap]]; however, with a bullet swap, payment is postponed until the swap ends or the position closes.

## Requirements for Total [[Return]] Swaps

In a [[Total Return Swap|total return swap]], the party receiving the total [[Return|return]] collects any income generated by the asset and benefits if the price of the asset appreciates over the life of the [[Swap|swap]]. In exchange, the total return receiver must pay the asset owner the set rate over the life of the swap.

If the asset's price falls over the [[Swap|swap]]'s life, the total [[Return|return]] receiver [[Will|will]] be required to pay the asset owner the amount by which the asset has fallen. In a [[Total Return Swap|total return swap]], the receiver assumes systematic, or market, [[Risk|risk]] and credit risk. Conversely, the payer forfeits the risk associated with the performance of the referenced [[Security|security]] but takes on the credit exposure to which the receiver may be subject.

## [[Total Return Swap]] Example

Assume that two parties enter into a one-year [[Total Return Swap|total return swap]] in which one party receives the [[London Interbank Offered Rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) ([LIBOR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp)) in addition to a fixed margin of 2%. The other party receives the total [[Return|return]] of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) on a [[Principal|principal]] amount of $1 million.

After one year, if LIBOR is 3.5% and the S&P 500 appreciates by 15%, the first party pays the second party 15% and receives 5.5%. The payment is netted at the end of the [[Swap|swap]] with the second party receiving a payment of $95,000, or \[$1 million x (15% - 5.5%)\]. 

Conversely, consider that rather than appreciating, the S&P 500 falls by 15%. The first party would receive 15% in addition to the LIBOR rate plus the fixed margin, and the payment netted to the first party would be $205,000, or \[$1 million x (15% + 5.5%)\].
