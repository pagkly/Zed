[[Current Yield]]
## What Is the [[Current Yield]]?

[[Current Yield|Current yield]] is an investment's annual income (interest or dividends) divided by the [[current price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp) of the [[Security|security]]. This measure examines the current price of a bond, rather than looking at its [[face value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp). Current [[Yield|yield]] represents the [[Return|return]] an investor would expect to earn, if the owner purchased the bond and held it for a year. However, current yield is not the [[actual return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actualreturn.asp) an investor receives if he holds a bond until maturity.

#### Bond Yields: [[Current Yield]] And YTM

## Breaking Down [[Current Yield]]

[[Current Yield|Current yield]] is most often applied to bond investments, which are securities that are issued to an investor at a [[par value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) (face amount) of $1,000. A bond carries a [[coupon]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) amount of interest that is stated on the face of the bond certificate, and bonds are traded between investors. Since the market price of a bond changes, an investor may purchase a bond at a discount (less than par value) or a [[Premium|premium]] (more than par value), and the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of a bond affects the current [[Yield|yield]].

### Key Takeaways

-   In fixed income investing, a bond's [[Current Yield|current yield]] is an investment's annual income, including both interest payments and dividends payments, which are then divided by the current price of the [[Security|security]]. 
-   Because the market price of a bond may change, investors may purchase bonds at either a discount or a [[Premium|premium]], where the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of a bond affects the [[Current Yield|current yield]].
-   With equities, the [[Current Yield|current yield]] can also be calculated by taking the dividends received for a [[Stock|stock]] and dividing that amount by the stock’s current market price.

## How [[Current Yield]] Is Calculated

If an investor buys a 6% [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] bond for a discount of $900, the investor earns annual interest income of ($1,000 X 6%), or $60. The [[Current Yield|current yield]] is ($60) / ($900), or 6.67%. The $60 in annual interest is fixed, regardless of the price paid for the bond. On the other hand, if an investor purchases a bond at a [[Premium|premium]] of $1,100, the current [[Yield|yield]] is ($60) / ($1,100), or 5.45%. The investor paid more for the premium bond that pays the same dollar amount of interest, therefore the current yield is lower.

[[Current Yield|Current yield]] can also be calculated for [[Stocks|stocks]] by taking the [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) received for a [[Stock|stock]] and dividing the amount by the stock’s current market price.

## Factoring in [[Yield]] to Maturity

[Yield to maturity (YTM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldtomaturity.asp) is the total [[Return|return]] earned on a bond, assuming that the bond owner holds the bond until the maturity date. For example, let's assume that the 6% [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] bond purchased for a discount of $900, [[Will|will]] mature in the 10 years. To calculate YTM, an investor makes an assumption about a [[Discount Rate|discount rate]], so that the future [[Principal|principal]] and interest payments are discounted to present value.

In this example, the investor receives $60 in annual interest payments for 10 years. At maturity, the owner receives the par value of $1,000, and the investor recognizes a $100 capital [[Gain|gain]]. The present value of the interest payments and the capital gain are added to compute the bond's YTM. If the bond is purchased at a [[Premium|premium]], the YTM calculation includes a [[capital loss]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalloss.asp) when the bond matures at par value. (For related reading, see "[Current [[Yield]] vs. Yield to Maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072915/what-relationship-between-current-yield-and-yield-maturity-ytm.asp)")

As a financial theory general rule, investors should expect higher returns, for riskier investments. Therefore, if two bonds have similar [[Risk|risk]] profiles, investors should opt for the higher [[Return|return]] producing [[Offering|offering]].
