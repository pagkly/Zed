[[Risk Reversal Definition]]
## What is a [[Risk]] [[Reversal]]?

A [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] is a hedging strategy that protects a [[long]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) or short position by using [[put]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp) and [[call]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call.asp) options. This strategy protects against unfavorable price movements in the [[Underlying|underlying]] position but limits the profits that can be made on that position. If an [[investor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) is long a [[Stock|stock]], they could create a short risk reversal to [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) their position by buying a put option and selling a call option.

In [[foreign exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/what-is-foreign-exchange.asp) (FX) trading, [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] is the difference in [[implied volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp) between similar call and put options, which conveys market information used to make trading decisions. 

## [[Risk]] [[Reversal]] Explained

[[Risk]] reversals, also known as [protective collars](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collar.asp), have a purpose to protect or [[Hedge|hedge]] an [[Underlying|underlying]] position using options. One option is bought and another is [[written]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp). The bought option requires the trader to pay a [premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp), while the written option produces premium income for the trader. This income reduces the cost of the trade, or even produces a credit. While the written option reduces the cost of the trade (or produces a credit), it also limits the profit that can be made on the underlying position.

## [[Risk]] [[Reversal]] Mechanics

If an investor is [[short]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset, the investor hedges the position with a long [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] by purchasing a call option and writing a put option on the underlying instrument. If the price of the underlying asset rises, the call option [[Will|will]] become more valuable, offsetting the loss on the short position. If the price drops, the trader will profit on their short position in the underlying, but only down to the strike price of the written put.

If an investor is long an [[Underlying|underlying]] instrument, the investor shorts a [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] to [[Hedge|hedge]] the position by writing a call and purchasing a put option on the underlying instrument. If the price of the underlying drops, the put option [[Will|will]] increase in value, offsetting the loss in the underlying. If the price of the underlying rises, the underlying position will increase in value but only up to the [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) of the written call.

## [[Risk]] [[Reversal]] and Foreign Exchange Options

A [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] in [[forex trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/073115/can-forex-trading-make-you-rich.asp) refers to the difference between the implied [[Volatility|volatility]] of [[out of the money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp) (OTM) calls and OTM puts. The greater the demand for an options contract, the greater its volatility and its price. A positive risk reversal means the volatility of calls is greater than the volatility of similar puts, which implies more market participants are betting on a rise in the currency than on a drop, and vice versa if the risk reversal is negative. Thus, risk reversals can be used to gauge positions in the FX market and convey information to make trading decisions.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] hedges a long or short position using put and call options.
-   A [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] protects against unfavorable price movement but limits gains.
-   Holders of a long position short a [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] by writing a call option and purchasing a put option.
-   Holders of a short position go long a [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] by purchasing a call option and writing a put option.
-   FX traders refer to [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]] as the difference in implied [[Volatility|volatility]] between similar call and put options.

## Real World Example of a [[Risk]] [[Reversal]]

Say Sean is long General Electric Company ([GE](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=ge)) at $11 and wants to [[Hedge|hedge]] his position, he could initiate a short [[Risk|risk]] [[Reversal|reversal]]. Let’s assume the [[Stock|stock]] currently trades near $11. Sean could buy a $10 put option and sell a $12.50 call option.

Since the call option is OTM, the [[Premium|premium]] received [[Will|will]] be less than the premium paid for the put option. Thus, the trade will result in a [[debit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debit.asp). Under this scenario, Sean is protected against any price moves below $10, because below this, the put option will offset further losses in the [[Underlying|underlying]]. If the [[Stock|stock]] price rises, Sean only profits on the stock position up to $12.50, at which point the written call will offset any further gains in the General Electric’s share price.
