[[Open-Market Transaction]]
## What Is an [[Open-Market Transaction]]?

An [[Open-Market Transaction|open-market transaction]] is an order placed by an [[insider]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insider.asp), after all of the appropriate documentation has been filed with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC), to buy or sell restricted securities openly on an exchange.

An [[Open-Market Transaction|open-market transaction]] is a legal way for an individual with insider information of their company to trade securities without violating [[insider trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insidertrading.asp) laws.

### Key Takeaways

-   An [[Open-Market Transaction|open-market transaction]] refers to the buying or selling of [[Shares|shares]] in a company by insiders of that company.
-   When enacting an [[Open-Market Transaction|open-market transaction]], an insider has to fill out the appropriate paperwork with the SEC to avoid violating any insider trading laws.
-   When open-market transactions occur, outside investors pay attention as the purchase or sale of securities by insiders can indicate the outlook of the company.
-   More interest is placed on the buying of [[Shares|shares]] by insiders than the selling of shares.

## Understanding an [[Open-Market Transaction]]

The SEC defines an insider as "an officer or director of a [[public company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp) or an individual or entity owning more than 10% of a company's [[stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp)."1

When insiders are buying or selling their own company's [[Stock|stock]], investors pay attention as it provides insight into what is occurring within the confines of the company that outsiders are not privy to.

Are insiders selling their [[Shares|shares]] because [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) were drastically below estimates and they expect the share price to fall? Are insiders buying shares because they created a successful new product that [[Will|will]] send the share price skyrocketing?

The trading actions of insiders is an indicator of how the [[Stock|stock]] [[Will|will]] perform in the future. But before they can buy or sell their [[Shares|shares]], known as open-market transactions, they must file the correct paperwork and follow all procedures.

## The Process of an [[Open-Market Transaction]]

An [[Open-Market Transaction|open-market transaction]] is simply an order placed by an insider to buy or sell [[Shares|shares]] according to the rules and regulations set out by the SEC. The importance of an open [[market order]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketorder.asp) is that the insider is voluntarily buying or selling shares at or close to the [[market price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp). There is no special pricing involved in open-market transactions.

Insiders must report open-market transactions with the SEC and include relevant details about the sale or purchase of the [[Shares|shares]]. Because the reason for the transaction is given, the filings of open-market transactions might be used by other investors to [[Gain|gain]] some perspective on what insiders may believe about the company.

For example, if an insider sells a considerable portion of their [[Shares|shares]] through an [[Open-Market Transaction|open-market transaction]], the reasons [[Listed|listed]] with the filing could cause other investors to change their portfolios in response. If the reason was simply to take advantage of [[stock options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp) provided to a high-level officer, outsider investors [[Will|will]] most likely not react.

In fact, more importance is given to the purchase of [[Shares|shares]] rather than to the sale of shares as a sale could be done for many reasons.

[SEC Form 4](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form4.asp) needs to be filed by an insider before buying or selling [[Shares|shares]]. Form 4 lists information such as "the name of the insider, their relationship to the company, how many shares were traded, and at what price."2

## Why Open-Market Transactions Are Made by Insiders

There are many reasons that insiders would buy more [[Shares|shares]] or sell their current shares. As stated above, buying shares is more insightful as it indicates a belief in the success of a company.

The selling of [[Shares|shares]] can be done for many reasons, as simple as that the [[shareholder]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) needs cash and the insider wants to take advantage of profits their investment has accrued.

Conversely, the insider may have weighed long-term considerations about the company or industry that prompted the sale of those [[Shares|shares]]. The same could be said about the purchase of more shares in the company.

When certain open market transactions occur, companies might issue press statements about the open-market transactions that involve prominent insiders buying [[Shares|shares]]. For example, if a chairman buys one million shares in their own company, an accompanying statement could declare this is an affirmation of faith in the management.

The [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of those [[Shares|shares]] [[Will|will]] also be [[Listed|listed]]. There might also be a reference to how many shares in the company the insider will own after the transaction is complete.

## Open Market Operations

It is important to note that open-market transactions differ from central banking programs known as [[open market operations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openmarketoperations.asp). Under such programs, the Federal Reserve purchases or sells government securities, like bonds, in the [[open market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp) alongside investors.

Open market operations are used as a form of [[monetary policy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) to control the money [[Supply|supply]] by impacting interest rates and [[Liquidity|liquidity]] in the economy. This action is typically used during or after a [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]].
