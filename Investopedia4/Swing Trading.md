[[Swing Trading]]
## What Is [[Swing Trading]]?

[[Swing Trading|Swing trading]] is a style of trading that attempts to capture short- to medium-term gains in a [[Stock|stock]] (or any financial instrument) over a period of a few days to several weeks. Swing traders primarily use [[technical analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) to look for trading opportunities. These traders may utilize [[fundamental analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) in addition to analyzing price trends and patterns.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Swing Trading|Swing trading]] involves taking trades that last a couple of days up to several months in order to profit from an anticipated price move.
-   [[Swing Trading|Swing trading]] exposes a trader to overnight and weekend [[Risk|risk]], where the price could gap and open the following session at a substantially different price.
-   Swing traders can take profits utilizing an established [[Risk|risk]]/reward ratio based on a stop loss and profit target, or they can take profits or losses based on a technical indicator or [[Price Action|price action]] movements.

## Understanding [[Swing Trading]]

Typically, [[Swing Trading|swing trading]] involves holding a position either [[long or short]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-long-and-short-position-market.asp) for more than one trading session, but usually not longer than several weeks or a couple of months. This is a general time frame, as some trades may last longer than a couple of months, yet the trader may still consider them swing trades. Swing trades can also occur during a trading session, though this is a rare outcome that is brought about by extremely volatile conditions.

The goal of [[Swing Trading|swing trading]] is to capture a chunk of a potential price move. While some traders seek out volatile [[Stocks|stocks]] with lots of movement, others may prefer more sedate stocks. In either case, swing trading is the process of identifying where an asset's price is likely to move next, entering a position, and then capturing a chunk of the profit if that move materializes.

Successful swing traders are only looking to capture a chunk of the expected price move, and then move on to the next opportunity.

[[Swing Trading|Swing trading]] is one of the most popular forms of active trading, where traders look for intermediate-term opportunities using various forms of [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]].

Many swing traders assess trades on a [[risk/reward]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskrewardratio.asp) basis. By analyzing the chart of an asset they determine where they [[Will|will]] enter, where they will place a [[stop loss]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp), and then anticipate where they can get out with a profit. If they are risking $1 per share on a setup that could reasonably produce a $3 [[Gain|gain]], that is a favorable [[Risk|risk]]/reward ratio. On the other hand, risking $1 to make $1 or only make $0.75 isn't quite as favorable.

Swing traders primarily use [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]], due to the short-term nature of the trades. That said, [[Fundamental Analysis|fundamental analysis]] can be used to enhance the analysis. For example, if a swing trader sees a [[bullish]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp) setup in a [[Stock|stock]], they may want to verify that the [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] of the asset look favorable or are improving also.

Swing traders [[Will|will]] often look for opportunities on the daily charts and may watch 1-hour or 15-minute charts to find a precise entry, stop loss, and [[take-profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/take-profitorder.asp) levels.

Pros

-   It requires less time to trade than day trading.
    
-   It maximizes short-term profit potential by capturing the bulk of market swings.
    
-   Traders can rely exclusively on [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]], simplifying the trading process.
    

Cons

-   Trade positions are subject to overnight and weekend market [[Risk|risk]].
    
-   Abrupt market reversals can result in substantial losses.
    
-   Swing traders often miss longer-term trends in favor of short-term market moves.
    

## Day Trading vs. [[Swing Trading]]

The [[distinction between swing trading and day trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052815/pros-cons-day-trading-vs-swing-trading.asp) is, usually, the holding time for positions. [[Swing Trading|Swing trading]], often, involves at least an overnight [[Hold|hold]], whereas day traders close out positions before the [[market closes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingsession.asp). To generalize, day trading positions are limited to a single day while swing trading involves holding for several days to weeks.

By holding overnight, the swing trader incurs the unpredictability of overnight [[Risk|risk]] such as [[gaps]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gap.asp) up or down against the position. By taking on the overnight risk, swing trades are usually done with a smaller position size compared to day trading (assuming the two traders have similarly sized accounts). Day traders typically utilize larger position sizes and may use a [[day trading margin]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/071114/guide-day-trading-margin.asp) of 25%.1

Swing traders also have access to margin or [[Leverage|leverage]] of 50%. This means that if the trader is approved for margin trading, they only need to put up $25,000 in capital for a trade with a current value of $50,000, for example.

## [[Swing Trading]] Tactics

A swing trader tends to look for multi-day chart patterns. Some of the more common patterns involve moving average crossovers, cup-and-handle patterns, [[head and shoulders patterns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head-shoulders.asp), flags, and triangles. Key [[Reversal|reversal]] [[candlesticks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp) may be used in addition to other indicators to devise a solid [[trading plan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-plan.asp).

Ultimately, each swing trader devises a plan and strategy that gives them an edge over many trades. This involves looking for trade setups that tend to lead to predictable movements in the asset's price. This isn't easy, and no strategy or setup works every time. With a favorable [[Risk|risk]]/reward, winning every time isn't required. The more favorable the risk/reward of a trading strategy, the fewer times it needs to win in order to produce an overall profit over many trades.

## Real-World Example of Swing Trade in Apple

Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020

The chart above shows a period where Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)) had a strong price move higher. This was followed by a small [[Cup and Handle|cup and handle]] pattern which often signals a continuation of the price rise if the [[Stock|stock]] moves above the high of the handle.

In this case:

-   The price does rise above the handle, triggering a possible buy near $192.70.
-   One possible place to put a stop loss is below the handle, marked by the rectangle, near $187.50.
-   Based on the entry and stop-loss, the estimated [[Risk|risk]] for the trade is $5.20 per share ($192.70 - $187.50).
-   If looking for a potential reward that is at least twice the [[Risk|risk]], any price above $203.10 ($192.70 + (2 \* $5.20)) [[Will|will]] provide this.

Aside from a [[Risk|risk]]/reward, the trader could also utilize other exit methods, such as waiting for the price to make a new low. With this method, an exit signal wasn't given until $216.46, when the price dropped below the prior [[Pullback|pullback]] low. This method would have resulted in a profit of $23.76 per share. Thought of another way—a 12% profit in exchange for less than 3% risk. This swing trade took approximately two months.

Other exit methods could be when the price crosses below a moving average (not shown), or when an indicator such as the [[stochastic oscillator]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp) crosses its [[signal line]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signal_line.asp).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the "swings" in [[Swing Trading|swing trading]]?

[[Swing Trading|Swing trading]] tried to identify entry and exit points into a [[Security|security]] on the basis of its intra-week or intra-month oscillations, between cycles of optimism and pessimism.

### How does [[Swing Trading|swing trading]] differ from day trading?

Day trading, as the name suggests, involves making dozens of trades in a single day, based on [technical analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) and sophisticated charting systems. Day trading seeks to [[scalp]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/012815/top-technical-indicators-scalping-trading-strategy.asp) small profits multiple times a day, closing out positions overnight. Swing traders do not close their positions on a daily basis and instead may [[Hold|hold]] onto them for weeks or months, or even longer. Swing traders [[Will|will]] also tend to incorporate both technical and [[Fundamental Analysis|fundamental analysis]].

### What are some indicators or tools used by swing traders?

Swing traders [[Will|will]] use tools like moving averages overlaid on daily or weekly candlestick charts, [[Momentum|momentum]] indicators, price range tools, and measures of [[Market Sentiment|market sentiment]]. Swing traders are also on the lookout for technical patterns like the head-and-shoulders and cup-and-handle.

### Which types of securities are best-suited for [[Swing Trading|swing trading]]?

While a swing trader can enjoy success in any number of securities, the best candidates tend to be large-cap [[Stocks|stocks]], which are among the most actively traded stocks on the major exchanges. In an active market, these stocks [[Will|will]] often swing between broadly-defined high and low points, and the swing trader will ride the wave in one direction for a couple of days or weeks and then switch to the opposite side of the trade when the [[Stock|stock]] reverses direction. Swing trades are also viable in actively-traded commodities and forex markets.
