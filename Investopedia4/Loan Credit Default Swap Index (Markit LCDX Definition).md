[[Loan Credit Default Swap Index (Markit LCDX Definition)]]
## What is the [[Loan]] Credit [[Default]] [[Swap]] Index?

The [[Loan]] Credit [[Default]] [[Swap]] Index - Markit LCDX is a specialized index of [[loan-only credit default swaps]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan-credit-default-swap.asp) (CDS) covering 100 individual North American companies that have [[Unsecured|unsecured]] [[Debt|debt]] trading in the broad secondary markets. The LCDX is traded over the counter and is managed by a consortium of large investment banks, which provide [[Liquidity|liquidity]] and assist in pricing the individual credit default swaps. IHS Markit Ltd, headquartered in London, is the index provider.

## Understanding the [[Loan]] Credit [[Default]] [[Swap]] Index (Markit LCDX Works)

The index begins with a fixed [[coupon rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp) (225 basis points); trading moves the price and changes the [[Yield|yield]], much like a standard bond. The index rolls every six months. Buyers of the index pay the [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] (and purchase the protection against credit events), while sellers receive the coupon and sell the protection. What is being protected in this instance is a "credit event" at a particular company in the index, such as its defaulting on a [[Loan|loan]] or declaring bankruptcy.

If such a credit event occurs in one of the [[Underlying|underlying]] companies, the protection is paid out via physical delivery of the [[Debt|debt]] or through a cash settlement between the two parties. The underlying company is then removed from the index, and a new one is substituted in order to [[Return|return]] the index to an even 100 members.

Credit [[Default|default]] swaps essentially put a price on the [[Risk|risk]] that a particular [[Debt|debt]] issuer might default. Companies with strong [[credit ratings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) have low-risk premiums, so protection can be purchased for a minimal fee, assessed as a percentage of the [[notional (dollar) value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notionalvalue.asp) of the [[Underlying|underlying]] debt. Companies with low credit ratings cost more to protect against, so the credit default swaps covering them may cost several additional percentage points of the notional amount.

Minimum purchase amounts for the LCDX can run into the millions of dollars, so most investors are large institutional firms, such as asset managers, banks, [[Hedge|hedge]] funds, and insurance companies, which invest as either a hedge or as a speculative play. The advantage of the LCDX to these investors is that they can [[Gain|gain]] access to a diversified group of companies for much less than it would cost them to purchase the credit [[Default|default]] swaps individually.
