[[What Is a Joint Account]]?
## [[What Is a Joint Account]]?

A [[Joint|joint]] account is a bank or [[brokerage account]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerageaccount.asp) shared between two or more individuals. Joint accounts are most likely to be used by relatives, couples, or business partners who have a level of familiarity and trust with each other. It typically allows anyone named on the account to access funds within it. There are multiple ways accounts can be established, each with its own implications for how money or assets can be accessed within the account or how the contents of the account are handled after one of the joint holders passes away.

### Key Takeaways:

-   A [[Joint|joint]] account is a bank or brokerage account shared by two or more individuals.
-   [[Joint]] account holders have equal access to funds but also share equal responsibility for any fees or charges incurred.
-   Transactions conducted through a [[Joint|joint]] account may require the signature of all parties or just one.

## How [[Joint]] Accounts Work

[[Joint]] accounts work just like regular accounts, except they can have two or more authorized users. Joint accounts can be established on a permanent basis, such as [[an account for a couple]](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0312/should-you-open-a-joint-bank-account.aspx) into which their salaries are deposited. The account may also be temporary, such as an account between two parties who are contributing funds in the short term.

Bank accounts held jointly between two parties may be titled with an "and" or an "or" between the account holders' names. If the account is [[Listed|listed]] as an "and" account, then both/all parties must sign to access the funds. If it is an "or" account, only one of the parties needs to sign. 

Accounts that are jointly held include deposit accounts at banks including checking and savings accounts, [[credit cards]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp), and other credit products such as loans, [[lines of credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lineofcredit.asp) (LOC), and [[mortgages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp). The [[Joint|joint]] status authorizes all those [[Listed|listed]] on the account full use, but also the responsibility for any payments, fees, or charges incurred.

Opening a [[Joint|joint]] account is as simple as opening up a single account. Both parties should be present at the bank when the account is open—whether that's a deposit account or other product like a mortgage or [[Loan|loan]]. For credit cards, adding a secondary or authorized user is akin to opening a joint account. In most cases, this requires the signature of the second party.

### Uses and Benefits of [[Joint]] Accounts

[[Joint]] accounts can be useful for their holders and provide a number of benefits. Many accounts require [[minimum balances]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum-balance.asp), particularly if the holder wants to access the benefits of a specific account type. By pooling their money, two people can bypass this requirement and reap the benefits of the account.

Opening a [[Joint|joint]] account may also be helpful to [[newer couples]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/030716/managing-money-couple.asp) who are combining their finances. Couples may find it easier to have a single account into which they can deposit their paychecks and make payments for their rent or mortgage, bills, or other joint debts.

A senior may find it useful to add one of their children or another authorized user to their accounts in order to pay bills and do routine banking on their behalf if and when they are not able to do so on their own.

### Pitfalls of [[Joint]] Accounts

[[Joint]] accounts can cause problems, however, because they generally provide all parties unlimited access to the funds. Thus, if one spouse has difficulty controlling their spending habits, this may affect the other spouse, who may be more frugal. The frugal spouse cannot challenge the withdrawals or transactions of the other spouse with the bank because they are [[Listed|listed]] as a joint account holder.

Another thing to keep in mind with [[Joint|joint]] accounts is that all parties with access are responsible for any and all [[fees]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fee.asp) and charges. If your husband runs up your joint credit card, you are equally responsible for paying it back. Similarly, if your joint [[Checking Account|checking account]] goes into [[overdraft]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overdraft.asp), you are both liable for the negative balance.

The government may seize any funds in a [[Joint|joint]] account to satisfy an outstanding order. That includes [[back taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/back-taxes.asp) that may be owed, child support, or other court-ordered [[garnishments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/[[Garnishment|garnishment]].asp).

It is best for both parties to speak to discuss the responsibilities associated with opening a [[Joint|joint]] account before doing so. This can avoid any unnecessary problems and conflict that may arise.

All parties should discuss the pros and cons of opening a [[Joint|joint]] account to avoid potential future conflicts.

### [[Joint]] Account Rights

There are several titling mechanics that designate how the funds are divided if one of the parties on the account passes away. These options are required on brokerage accounts.

**[[Joint]] Tenants with Rights of Survivorship (JTWROS):** If one of the parties passes away, the assets in the account pass by the rule of law—outside of [[probate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Probate|probate]].asp)—to the surviving parties.

**Tenants in Common (TIC):** This allows each [[Joint|joint]] holder of the account to designate their own beneficiary for their portion of the assets in the event they pass away. Instead of transferring by the rule of law to the second account holder, the assets are passed to the [[beneficiary]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp). In addition, the assets may not be automatically split 50/50. The TIC designation allows the tenants to divide ownership of the property any way they choose.

**[[Joint]] Tenants option:** Selecting this option mandates a 50/50 split of the assets in the joint account.
