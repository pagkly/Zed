[[What Is Maturity]]?
## [[What Is Maturity]]?

Maturity is the date on which the life of a transaction or [[financial instrument]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp) ends, after which it must either be renewed, or it [[Will|will]] cease to exist. The term is commonly used for deposits, foreign exchange spot, and forward transactions, interest rate and commodity swaps, options, loans and [[fixed income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) instruments such as bonds. They are sometimes altered by bonus rates as part of [[promotions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promotional-cd-rate-bonus-cd-rate.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   Maturity is the agreed-upon date in which the investment ends, often triggering the repayment of a [[Loan|loan]] or bond, the payment of a commodity or cash payment, or some other payment or settlement term.
-   It's a term that is most commonly used in relation to bonds but is also used for deposits, currencies, interest rate and commodity swaps, options, loans, and other transactions.
-   The maturity date for loans and other [[Debt|debt]] can change repeatedly throughout the lifetime of a [[Loan|loan]], should a borrower renew the loan, [[Default|default]], incur higher interest fees, or pay off the total debt early.

## Understanding Maturity

Some financial instruments, such as deposits and loans, require repayment of [[Principal|principal]] and interest at maturity; others, such as [[foreign exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp) transactions, provide for the delivery of a commodity. Still others, such as [[interest rate swaps]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp), consist of a series of cash flows with the final one occurring at maturity.

## Maturity of a Deposit

The maturity of a [[deposit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deposit.asp) is the date on which the [[Principal|principal]] is returned to the investor. Interest is sometimes paid periodically during the lifetime of the deposit, or at maturity. Many interbank deposits are overnight, including most euro deposits, and a maturity of more than 12 months is rare.

## Bond

At the maturity of a fixed-income investment such as a bond, the borrower is required to repay the full amount of the outstanding [[Principal|principal]] plus any applicable interest to the [[Lender|lender]]. Nonpayment at maturity may constitute [[Default|default]], which would negatively affect the issuer's [[credit rating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp). The maturity of an investment is a primary consideration for the investor since it has to match his [[investment horizon]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment_horizon.asp). For example, a person who is saving money for the down payment on a home that he intends to purchase within a year would be ill-advised to invest in a five-year term deposit and should instead consider a money-market fund or a one-year term deposit.

## Derivatives

The term maturity can also be used concerning [[derivative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) instruments such as options and [[warrants]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Warrant|warrant]].asp), but it's important to distinguish maturity from the expiration date. For an option, the expiration date is the last date on which an American-style option can be exercised, and the only date that a European-style option can be exercised; the maturity date is the date on which the [[Underlying|underlying]] transaction settles if the option is exercised. The maturity or expiration date of a [[Stock|stock]] warrant is the last date that it can be exercised to purchase the underlying stock at the strike price.

The maturity on an interest rate [[Swap|swap]] is the settlement date of the final set of cash flows.

## Foreign Exchange

The maturity date of a spot foreign exchange transaction is two business days, with the exception of U.S. dollar vs. Canadian dollar transactions, which settle on the next business day. On that date, company A pays currency A to company B and receives currency B in [[Return|return]].

The maturity date on a foreign exchange forward or [[Swap|swap]] is the date on which the final exchange of currencies takes place; it can be anything longer than spot.
