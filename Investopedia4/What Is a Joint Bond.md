[[What Is a Joint Bond]]?
## [[What Is a Joint Bond]]?

A [[Joint|joint]] bond is sold with a guarantee of the payment of [[Principal|principal]] and interest by at least two parties. In the case of [[Default|default]] by the issuer, the [[bondholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp) have the right to claim repayment by any and all of all the issuing institutions, corporations, or individuals. This shared responsibility reduces the [[Risk|risk]] to the investor but also generally means a lower rate of [[return on the investment.]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp)

The [[Joint|joint]] bond is also known as a joint-and-several bond.

## Understanding a [[Joint]] Bond

A [[Joint|joint]] bond is most often issued when a corporate [[parent company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parentcompany.asp) is required to guarantee the obligations of a subsidiary business. Such instances are similar to a parent's decision to co-sign a car [[Loan|loan]] for a child.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Joint|joint]] bond, or joint-and-several bond, is guaranteed by at least two parties.
-   Much like the co-signer of a [[Loan|loan]], the second party guarantees payment if the issuer defaults.
-   [[Joint]] bonds are extremely safe investments, and therefore [[Offer|offer]] a more modest [[Return|return]] to the investor.

Parent companies are typically larger firms that own a majority stake in one or more smaller subsidiaries in the same industry or complementary industries.

A subsidiary that wants to raise money for a capital project may not be able to do it alone or may be able to issue it only at a high rate of interest. [[Debt]] investors may be wary of a bond issued by a subsidiary, especially if it does not have as high a credit [[Rating|rating]] as the parent company.

The parent company can step in to act as an additional guarantor on the [[Debt|debt]].

### Federal Home [[Loan]] [[Joint]] Bonds

Another example of a [[Joint|joint]] bond issuer is the [[Federal Home Loan Bank System]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhlb.asp) (FHLB). The bank was founded by Congress in 1932 in order to help [[Finance|finance]] the community banking system. The FHLB Office of Finance issues a joint bond [[Security|security]] to fund the 11 Federal Home [[Loan]] Banks that make up its regional network. This financing is then passed on to local financial institutions to support lending to home buyers, farmers, and small business owners.

The Federal Home [[Loan]] Bank’s organizational structure of [[joint-and-several liability]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/[[Joint|joint]]-and-several-[[Liability|liability]].asp) makes it unique among housing-related government-sponsored enterprises and helps it serve as a pillar of the nation’s small business and [[Home Mortgage|home mortgage]] financing systems.

### Lessons From Greece

Many economists have argued that the European Union should consider issuing [[Joint|joint]] bonds to strengthen the euro currency. They point to the aftermath of the 2008-2009 economic crisis to illustrate the point.

In 2014, Greece was mired in recession and could not take independent currency stimulus action to alleviate it because it has adopted the euro currency. Advocates of [[Joint|joint]] bonds argued that Greece needed the support and credit of its fellow [[Eurozone|eurozone]] members so that it could pay its bills until growth resumed.

Proposals for a European [[Joint|joint]] bond, or a European common bond, are floated intermittently. The latest iteration, called a European Safe Bond, was proposed in 2018 by a committee chaired by Irish central bank governor Philip Lane.1 

European banks and many governments within the [[Eurozone|eurozone]] could be supportive of such proposals since it would meet the demand for safe government [[Debt|debt]]. Previous proposals, however, have been blocked by Germany. German representatives are wary that a European [[Joint|joint]] bond would encourage fiscal irresponsibility in some of the poorer nations of the eurozone.
