[[Understanding Revenue]]
## What is Revenue?

[Revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102714/what-are-difference-between-gross-revenue-reporting-and-net-revenue-reporting.asp) is the [[income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp) generated from normal business operations and includes discounts and deductions for returned merchandise. It is the [[Top Line|top line]] or [[Gross Income|gross income]] figure from which costs are subtracted to determine net income.

Revenue is also known as sales on the income statement. It is vital for a [[startup]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp) to get positive revenue early.

### Key Takeaways

-   Revenue, often referred to as sales, is the income received from normal business operations and other business activities.
-   [[Operating income]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122714/what-difference-between-operating-income-and-revenue.asp) is income derived from normal business operations, such as sales of good or services.
-   Non-operating income is infrequent or nonrecurring income derived from secondary sources (e.g., lawsuit proceeds).

## [[Understanding Revenue]]

Revenue is money brought into a company by its business activities. Revenue is also known as sales, as in the [[price-to-sales ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-salesratio.asp) - an alternative to the [[price-to-earnings ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) that uses revenue in the denominator.

There are different ways to calculate revenue, depending on the accounting method employed. [[Accrual accounting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrualaccounting.asp) [[Will|will]] include sales made on credit as revenue for goods or services delivered to the customer. It is necessary to check the [[cash flow statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp) to assess how efficiently a company collects money owed. [Cash accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashaccounting.asp), on the other hand, will only count sales as revenue when payment is received. Cash paid to a company is known as a "receipt". It is possible to have receipts without revenue. For example, if the customer paid in advance for a service not yet rendered or undelivered goods, this activity leads to a receipt but not revenue.

Revenue is known as the [[Top Line|top line]] because it appears first on a company's [[income statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp). Net income, also known as the bottom line, is revenues minus expenses. There is a [[profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/what-difference-between-revenue-and-profit.asp) when revenues exceed expenses. To increase profit, and hence [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) for its shareholders, a company increases revenues and/or reduces expenses. Investors often consider a company's revenue and net income separately to determine the health of a business. It is possible for net income to grow while revenues remain stagnant because of cost-cutting. Such a situation does not bode well for a company's long-term growth. When public companies report their [[quarterly earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsreport.asp), the two figures that receive the most attention are revenues and earnings per share ("[earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/050604.asp)" being equivalent to net income). Subsequent price movement in [[Stocks|stocks]] generally correlates to whether a company beat or missed [[analysts']](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/092415/career-advice-financial-analyst-vsresearch-analyst.asp) revenue and earnings per share expectations.

## Types of Revenue

A company's revenue may be subdivided according to the divisions that generate it. For example, a recreational vehicles department might have a financing division, which could be a separate source of revenue. Revenue can also be divided into [[operating revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-revenue.asp) - sales from a company's core business - and non-operating revenue which is derived from secondary sources. As these non-operating revenue sources are often unpredictable or nonrecurring, they can be referred to as one-time events or gains. For example, proceeds from the sale of an asset, a windfall from investments, or money awarded through litigation are non-operating revenue.

## Examples of Revenue

In the case of government, revenue is the money received from [[Taxation|taxation]], fees, fines, inter-governmental grants or transfers, securities sales, mineral or resource rights, as well as any sales made.

For non-profits, revenues are its gross receipts. Its components include donations from individuals, foundations, and companies; grants from government entities; investments; fundraising activities; and membership fees.

In terms of real [[Estate|estate]] investments, revenue refers to the income generated by a property, such as rent, parking fees, on-site laundry costs, etc. When the operating expenses incurred in running the property is subtracted from property income, the resulting value is [[net operating income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noi.asp).
