[[Reinvestment]]
## What Is [[Reinvestment]]?

[[Reinvestment]] is the practice of using dividends, interest, or any other form of income distribution earned in an investment to purchase additional [[Shares|shares]] or units, rather than receiving the [distributions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution.asp) in cash.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Reinvestment]] is when income distributions received from an investment are plowed back into that investment instead of receiving cash.
-   [[Reinvestment]] works by using dividends received to purchase more of that [[Stock|stock]], or interest payments received to buy more of that bond.
-   Dividend [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] programs (DRIPs) automate the process of [[Stock|stock]] accumulation from dividend flows.
-   Fixed income and callable securities open up the potential for [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] [[Risk|risk]], where the new investments to be made with distributions are less opportune.

## Understanding Reinvestments

[[Reinvestment]] is a great way to significantly increase the value of a [[stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp), mutual fund, or exchange-traded fund (ETF) investment over time. It is facilitated when an investor uses proceeds distributed from the ownership of an investment to buy more [[Shares|shares]] or units of the same investment.

Proceeds can include any distribution paid out from the investment including dividends, interest, or any other form of distribution associated with the investment’s ownership. If not reinvested these funds would be paid to the investor as cash. [[Social enterprises]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-enterprise.asp) mainly reinvest back into their own operations.1

### Dividend [[Reinvestment]]

Dividend [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] plans, also known as [[DRIPs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp), allow investors the opportunity to efficiently reinvest proceeds in additional [[Shares|shares]] of the investment. Issuers of an investment can structure their investment offerings to include [[dividend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) reinvestment programs.

Corporations commonly [[Offer|offer]] dividend [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] plans. Other types of companies with public offerings such as master limited partnerships and [[real estate investment trusts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) can also institute dividend reinvestment plans. Fund companies paying distributions also decide whether or not they [[Will|will]] allow dividend reinvestment.

Investors investing in a [[Stock|stock]] that is traded on a public exchange [[Will|will]] typically enter into a dividend [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] plan through their brokerage platform elections. When buying an investment through a brokerage platform, an investor has the option to reinvest dividends if dividend reinvestment is enabled for the investment.

If dividend [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] is offered, an investor can typically change their election with their brokerage firm any time during the duration of their investment. Reinvestment is typically offered with no [[Commission|commission]] and allows the investors to buy fractional [[Shares|shares]] of a [[Security|security]] with the distributed proceeds.

### Income Investments

[[Reinvestment]] is an important consideration for all types of investments and can specifically add to investment gains for income investors. Numerous income-focused investments are offered for both [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] investments. The Vanguard High Dividend [[Yield]] Fund (VHDYX) is one of the broad market’s top dividend [[mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp). It is an index fund that seeks to track the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index.2 It offers investors the opportunity to reinvest all dividends in fractional [[Shares|shares]] of the fund.

Income investors choosing [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] should be sure to consider taxes when reinvesting paid distributions. Investors are still required to pay taxes on distributions regardless of whether or not they are reinvested.3

Zero-coupon bonds are the only fixed-income instrument to have no investment [[Risk|risk]] since they issue no coupon payments.

## Special Considerations: [[Reinvestment]] [[Risk]]

Although there are [[several advantages to reinvesting dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090915/reinvesting-dividends-pays-long-run.asp), there are times when the risks outweigh the rewards. For example, consider the [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] rate, or the amount of interest that can be earned when money is taken out of one [fixed-income investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) and put into another. Essentially, the reinvestment rate is the amount of interest the investor could earn if they purchased a new bond while holding a [callable bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callablebond.asp) called due because of an interest rate decline.

If an investor is reinvesting proceeds, they may need to consider [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] [[Risk|risk]]. [[Reinvestment risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinvestmentrisk.asp) is the chance that an investor [[Will|will]] be unable to reinvest cash flows (e.g., coupon payments) at a rate comparable to the current investment's rate of [[Return|return]]. Reinvestment risk can arise across all types of investments.

Generally, [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] [[Risk|risk]] is the risk that an investor could be earning a greater [[Return|return]] by investing proceeds in a higher returning investment. This is commonly considered with fixed income [[Security|security]] reinvestment since these investments have consistently stated rates of return that vary with new issuances and market rate changes. Prior to a significant investment distribution, investors should consider their current allocations and broad market investment options.

For example, an investor buys a 10-year $100,000 [Treasury note](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurynote.asp) with an interest rate of 6%. The investor expects to earn $6,000 per year from the [[Security|security]]. However, at the end of the term, interest rates are 4%. If the investor buys another 10-year $100,000 Treasury note, they [[Will|will]] earn $4,000 annually rather than $6,000. Also, if interest rates subsequently increase and they sell the note before its maturity date, they lose part of the [[Principal|principal]].
