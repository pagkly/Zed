[[Structured Finance]]
## What Is [[Structured Finance]]?

[[Structured Finance|Structured finance]] is a heavily involved financial instrument presented to large financial institutions or companies with complicated [financing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp) needs who are unsatisfied with conventional financial products. Since the mid-1980s, structured [[Finance|finance]] has become popular in the finance industry. [[Collateralized debt obligations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) (CDOs), [[Synthetic|synthetic]] financial instruments, [[collateralized bond obligations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cbo.asp) (CBOs), and syndicated loans are examples of structured finance instruments.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Structured Finance|Structured finance]] is a financial instrument available to companies with complex financing needs, which cannot be ordinarily solved with conventional financing.
-   Traditional lenders do not generally [[Offer|offer]] structured financing.
-   Structured financial products, such as collateralized [[Debt|debt]] obligations, are non-transferable.
-   [[Structured Finance|Structured finance]] is being used to manage [[Risk|risk]] and develop financial markets for complex emerging markets.

## Understanding [[Structured Finance]]

[[Structured Finance|Structured finance]] is typically indicated for borrowers—mostly extensive corporations—who have highly specified needs that a simple [[Loan|loan]] or another conventional financial instrument [[Will|will]] not satisfy. In most cases, structured [[Finance|finance]] involves one or several discretionary transactions to be completed; as a result, evolved and often risky instruments must be implemented.

## Benefits of [[Structured Finance]]

Structured financial products are typically not offered by traditional lenders. Generally, because [[Structured Finance|structured finance]] is required for major capital injection into a business or organization, investors are required to provide such financing. Structured financial products are almost always non-transferable, meaning that they cannot be shifted between various types of [[Debt|debt]] in the same way that a standard [[Loan|loan]] can.

Increasingly, structured financing and [[securitization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitization.asp) are used by corporations, governments, and financial intermediaries to manage [[Risk|risk]], develop financial markets, expand business reach, and design new funding instruments for advancing, evolving, and complex emerging markets. For these entities, using structured financing transforms cash flows and reshapes the [[Liquidity|liquidity]] of financial portfolios, in part by transferring risk from sellers to buyers of the structured products. [[Structured Finance|Structured finance]] mechanisms have also been used to help financial institutions remove specific assets from their balance sheets.

## Examples of [[Structured Finance]] Products

When a standard [[Loan|loan]] is not enough to cover unique transactions dictated by a corporation's operational needs, a number of [[Structured Finance|structured finance]] products may be implemented. Along with CDOs and CBOs, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), credit [[Default|default]] swaps (CDSs), and [[hybrid securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hybridsecurity.asp), combining elements of [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] securities, are often used.

Securitization is the process through which a financial instrument is created by combining financial assets, commonly resulting in such instruments as CDOs, [[asset-backed securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-backedsecurity.asp), and [[credit-linked notes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditlinkednote.asp). Various tiers of these repackaged instruments are then sold to investors. Securitization, much like [[Structured Finance|structured finance]], promotes [[Liquidity|liquidity]] and is used to develop the structured financial products used by qualified businesses and other customers. There are many benefits of securitization, including being a less expensive source of funding and better use of capital.

Mortgage-backed securities ([MBS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp)) a model example of securitization and its [[Risk|risk]]-transferring utility. Mortgages may be grouped into one large pool, leaving the issuer the opportunity to divide the pool into pieces that are based on the risk of [[Default|default]] inherent to each mortgage. The smaller pieces may then be sold to investors.
