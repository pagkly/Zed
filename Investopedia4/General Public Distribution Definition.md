[[General Public Distribution Definition]]
## What Is a General Public Distribution?

In [[Finance|finance]], the term general public distribution refers to the process by which a [[private company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatecompany.asp) becomes a [[publicly traded company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp) by selling its [[Shares|shares]] to the public at large. This is in contrast to a conventional public distribution, in which the shares are sold largely to [[institutional investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A general public distribution is the process of selling privately held [[Shares|shares]] to public stockholders for the first time.
-   It allows privately owned companies to become publicly traded, which can help them raise capital and generate [[Liquidity|liquidity]] for their early investors.
-   Once sold, the newly issued [[Shares|shares]] are then actively traded among investors in the secondary market.

## How General Public Distributions Work

The transaction whereby a private company's [[Shares|shares]] are sold to the public for the first time is known as its [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO). If the IPO involves directly selling to a large pool of investors, regardless of whether they are small [[retail investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp) or large funds, then that IPO would be referred to as a general public distribution. If on the other hand the IPO catered primarily to large and sophisticated investors_—_such as [[investment banks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentbank.asp), [[hedge funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp), and [[pension funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp)_—_then that would be considered a conventional public distribution.

When investors buy [[Shares|shares]] through an IPO, they are participating in what is known as the [[primary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarymarket.asp). In the primary market, the securities you purchase come directly from the company issuing them. By comparison, the secondary market is one where you purchase securities from other owners of that [[Security|security]] who either previously purchased them from the issuer or else purchased them from another owner entirely. The vast majority of transactions that take place are done in the secondary market, making IPOs relatively rare and closely watched events.

From the perspective of the company, there are many potential reasons to undertake an IPO. To begin, they may wish to raise funds for expansion, such as by building new facilities, hiring new employees, funding increased [[research and development]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp) (R&D) initiatives, or even [[acquiring]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp) a competitor. In this case, the IPO would represent a form of [[equity financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityfinancing.asp).

In other cases, a company may wish to IPO in order to increase the [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) available to its early investors, some of whom may wish to cash out their investment. Additional advantages may also exist, such as the increased prestige, credibility, and [[creditworthiness]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp) that is often associated with publicly traded companies.

## Real World Example of a General Public Distribution

XYZ Corporation is a prominent technology company that is contemplating how best to fund its expansion plans. Its managers feel that by opening new offices abroad and hiring new employees, they can effectively expand their customer base outside of the United States. Moreover, they see opportunities to acquire several small competitors they feel could add [[intellectual property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intellectualproperty.asp) and [[human resources]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humanresources.asp) to their [[Portfolio|portfolio]].

In considering their options for fundraising, XYZ decides to opt for [[Equity|equity]] financing through an IPO. To finalize their decision, they must decide between a general public distribution or a conventional public distribution. In the former, a greater percentage of their issued [[Shares|shares]] are likely to be held by retail investors, whereas the latter [[Will|will]] generally tend toward more institutional ownership.

In practice, however, the two different types of IPOs [[Will|will]] likely lead to similar medium and long-term results. This is because once the [[Shares|shares]] are sold in the primary market, investors will then trade them among themselves in the secondary market. 

For example, suppose the [[Shares|shares]] are issued to institutional investors but there is unmet market demand from retail investors. In that scenario, there would be nothing stopping those retail investors from making offers to purchase those shares from the institutional investors in the secondary market. 

Likewise, if the [[Shares|shares]] are sold mostly to retail investors, but demand for the shares then rises among institutional investors, retail investors [[Will|will]] be free to sell their shares. In this manner, the secondary market should ensure that XYZ's [[Stock|stock]] is ultimately held by those owners who value it most highly, regardless of who receives the shares in the IPO.
