[[What is a Loan Constant]]?
## [[What is a Loan Constant|What Is a Loan Constant]]?

A [[Loan|loan]] constant is a percentage that shows the annual [[debt service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtservice.asp) on a loan compared to its total [[Principal|principal]] value. The calculation for a loan constant is the annual [[Debt Service|debt service]] divided by the total loan amount. When shopping for a loan, borrowers can compare the loan constant of various loans before making a decision. The loan with the lowest loan constant [[Will|will]] have lower [[Debt|debt]] service requirements, meaning the borrower will pay less in interest and principal over a given period. Loan constants are only applicable to fixed interest rate loans and not [[loans with variable interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variableinterestrate.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Loan|loan]] constant is a percentage that shows the annual [[Debt Service|debt service]] of a loan compared to the total [[Principal|principal]] value of a loan.
-   [[Principal]], [[Loan|loan]] interest rate, and the length and frequency of payments are used for calculating a loan constant.
-   [[Loan]] constant tables and calculators are popular for calculating mortgage payments.
-   When shopping around for a [[Loan|loan]], borrowers [[Will|will]] often opt for the loan with the lowest loan constant as this means the [[Debt Service|debt service]] payments for that loan will be lower.

## How a [[Loan]] Constant Works

A [[Loan|loan]] constant is a comparison of a loan's annual [[Debt Service|debt service]] to the loan's total [[principal value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp). A loan's [[Debt|debt]] service is the total cash the borrower must pay to cover the repayment of interest and principal on the loan for a given period.

The [[Loan|loan]] constant is expressed as a percentage and can be determined for all [[types of loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp). It helps borrowers and analysts to understand better the factors involved with a loan and how much they are paying annually in comparison to the loan [[Principal|principal]].

## Calculating a [[Loan]] Constant

Calculating the [[Loan|loan]] constant often requires a borrower to obtain from the [[Lender|lender]] the multiple terms associated with the lending deal. Terms include factors such as total [[Principal|principal]], [[loan interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp), length of payments, and frequency of payments. Obtaining these loan term factors allows for the calculation of a simple present-value payment to arrive at the monthly payments. Once the monthly payments are identified, a borrower can easily calculate their loan constant using the following equation:

[[Loan]] Constant = Annual [[Debt Service]] / Total Loan Amount

For example, take a mortgage borrower who has obtained a $150,000 [[Loan|loan]]. The loan has a [[fixed interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp) of 6% with a 30-year duration and monthly interest payments. Using a payments calculator, the borrower would calculate monthly payments of $899.33, which results in an annual [[Debt Service|debt service]] of $10,791.96. With this annual [[Debt|debt]] service, the borrowerâ€™s loan constant would be 7.2% or $10,791.96 / $150,000.

## Special Considerations

The [[Loan|loan]] constant, when multiplied by the original loan [[Principal|principal]], gives the dollar amount of the annual periodic payments. The loan constant can be used to compare the true cost of borrowing. Loan constants are only available for loans with fixed interest rates since variable interest rates have differing annual [[Debt Service|debt service]] levels based on variable interest. Given the choice of two loans, a borrower [[Will|will]] generally opt for the one with the lower loan constant, since it will have the lower [[Debt|debt]] service requirement.

## [[Loan]] Constant Tables

[[Loan]] constant tables were widely used in the real [[Estate|estate]] industry before the advent of financial calculators since they made it relatively easy to calculate monthly [[mortgage payments]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-rates/payment-structure/). Loan constant tables provide prepopulated information for borrowers about their loan with a quoted loan constant level.

If the borrower from the example above were given their [[Loan|loan]] constant, they could find the interest and payment terms from a loan constant table without other inputs. The borrower would only need to identify 7.2% in the table. From there, they would find the corresponding interest rate of 6% on the horizontal axis. On the vertical axis, the number of payments in months would also be provided at 360.
