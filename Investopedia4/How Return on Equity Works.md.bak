# [[Return]] on [[Equity]] – ROE Definition

> ## Excerpt
> [[Return]] on [[Equity|equity]] (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its [[Debt|debt]], ROE could be thought of as the return on net assets.

[[How Return on Equity Works]]
## What Is [[Return]] on [[Equity]] (ROE)?

[[Return]] on [[Equity|equity]] (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) by [[shareholders' equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp). Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its [[Debt|debt]], ROE is considered the [[return on net assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070914/what-are-main-differences-between-return-equity-roe-and-return-assets-roa.asp). ROE is considered a measure of the profitability of a corporation in relation to stockholders’ equity.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Return]] on [[Equity|equity]] (ROE) measures how the profitability of a corporation in relation to stockholders’ equity.
-   Whether an ROE is considered satisfactory [[Will|will]] depend on what is normal for the industry or company peers.
-   As a shortcut, investors can consider an ROE near the long-term average of the S&P 500 (14%) as an acceptable ratio and anything less than 10% as poor.

## Understanding [[Return]] on [[Equity]]

ROE is expressed as a percentage and can be calculated for any company if net income and [[Equity|equity]] are both positive numbers. Net income is calculated before dividends paid to common shareholders and after dividends to preferred shareholders and interest to lenders.

[[Return]] on [[Equity]]\=Net IncomeAverage Shareholders’ Equity\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Return on Equity} = \\dfrac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

Net income is the amount of income, net of expense, and taxes that a company generates for a given period. Average shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] is calculated by adding equity at the beginning of the period. The beginning and end of the period should coincide with the period during which the net income is earned.

Net income over the last full fiscal year, or [[trailing 12 months]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp), is found on the [[income statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp)—a sum of financial activity over that period. Shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] comes from the [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp)—a running balance of a company’s entire history of changes in assets and liabilities.

It is considered best practice to calculate ROE based on average [[Equity|equity]] over a period because of the mismatch between the income statement and the balance sheet.

## What Does ROE Tell You?

Whether ROE is deemed good or bad [[Will|will]] depend on what is normal among a [[Stock|stock]]’s peers. For example, utilities have many assets and [[Debt|debt]] on the balance sheet compared to a relatively small amount of net income. A normal ROE in the utility sector could be 10% or less. A technology or retail firm with smaller balance sheet accounts relative to net income may have normal ROE levels of 18% or more.

A good [[Rule Of Thumb|rule of thumb]] is to target an ROE that is equal to or just above the average for the peer group. For example, assume a company, TechCo, has maintained a steady ROE of 18% over the last few years compared to the average of its peers, which was 15%. An investor could conclude that TechCo’s management is above average at using the company’s assets to create profits. Relatively high or low ROE ratios [[Will|will]] vary significantly from one industry group or sector to another. When used to evaluate one company to another similar company, the comparison will be more meaningful. A common shortcut for investors is to consider a [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]] near the long-term average of the S&P 500 (14%) as an acceptable ratio and anything less than 10% as poor.

### Using ROE to Estimate [[Growth Rates]]

Sustainable [[Growth Rates|growth rates]] and dividend growth rates can be estimated using ROE, assuming that the ratio is roughly in line or just above its peer group average. Although there may be some challenges, ROE can be a good starting place for developing future estimates of a [[Stock|stock]]’s growth rate and the growth rate of its [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp). These two calculations are functions of each other and can be used to make an easier comparison between similar companies.

To estimate a company’s future growth rate, multiply the ROE by the company’s [[retention ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retentionratio.asp). The [[Retention Ratio|retention ratio]] is the percentage of net income that is retained or reinvested by the company to fund future growth.

### ROE and a Sustainable Growth Rate

Assume that there are two companies with an identical ROE and net income, but different retention ratios. Company A has an ROE of 15% and returns 30% of its net income to shareholders in a dividend, which means company A retains 70% of its net income. Business B also has an ROE of 15% but returns only 10% of its net income to shareholders for a [[Retention Ratio|retention ratio]] of 90%.

For company A, the growth rate is 10.5%, or ROE times the [[Retention Ratio|retention ratio]], which is 15% times 70%. Business B's growth rate is 13.5%, or 15% times 90%.

This analysis is referred to as the [[sustainable growth rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/sustainable-growth-rate/) model. Investors can use this model to make estimates about the future and to identify [[Stocks|stocks]] that may be risky because they are running ahead of their sustainable growth ability. A [[Stock|stock]] that is growing slower than its sustainable rate could be undervalued, or the market may be discounting risky signs from the company. In either case, a growth rate that is far above or below the sustainable rate warrants additional investigation.

This comparison seems to make business B more attractive than company A, but it ignores the advantages of a higher dividend rate that may be favored by some investors. We can modify the calculation to estimate the [[Stock|stock]]’s dividend growth rate, which may be more important to income investors.

## Estimating the Dividend Growth Rate

Continuing with our example from above, the [[dividend growth rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendgrowthrate.asp) can be estimated by multiplying ROE by the [[payout ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payoutratio.asp). The [[Payout|payout]] ratio is the percentage of net income that is returned to common shareholders through dividends. This formula gives us a sustainable dividend growth rate, which favors company A.

The company A dividend growth rate is 4.5%, or ROE times the [[Payout|payout]] ratio, which is 15% times 30%. Business B's dividend growth rate is 1.5%, or 15% times 10%. A [[Stock|stock]] that is growing its dividend far above or below the sustainable dividend growth rate may indicate risks that should be investigated.

## Using ROE to Identify Problems

It is reasonable to wonder why an average or slightly above average ROE is good rather than an ROE that is double, triple, or even higher the average of their peer group. Aren’t [[Stocks|stocks]] with a very high ROE a better value?

Sometimes an extremely high ROE is a good thing if net income is extremely large compared to [[Equity|equity]] because a company’s performance is so strong. However, an extremely high ROE is often due to a small equity account compared to net income, which indicates [[Risk|risk]].

### Inconsistent Profits

The first potential issue with a high ROE could be inconsistent profits. Imagine a company, LossCo, that has been unprofitable for several years. Each year’s losses are recorded on the balance sheet in the [[Equity|equity]] portion as a “retained loss.” The losses are a negative value and reduce shareholder equity. Assume that LossCo has had a windfall in the most recent year and has returned to profitability. The denominator in the ROE calculation is now very small after many years of losses, which makes its ROE misleadingly high.

### Excess [[Debt]]

A second issue that could cause a high ROE is excess [[Debt|debt]]. If a company has been borrowing aggressively, it can increase ROE because [[Equity|equity]] is equal to assets minus debt. The more debt a company has, the lower equity can fall. A common scenario is when a company borrows large amounts of debt to buy back its own [[Stock|stock]]. This can inflate [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS), but it does not affect actual performance or [[Growth Rates|growth rates]].

### Negative Net Income

Finally, negative net income and negative shareholder [[Equity|equity]] can create an artificially high ROE. However, if a company has a net loss or negative shareholders’ equity, ROE should not be calculated.

If shareholders’ [[Equity|equity]] is negative, the most common issue is excessive [[Debt|debt]] or inconsistent profitability. However, there are exceptions to that rule for companies that are profitable and have been using [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] to buy back their own [[Shares|shares]]. For many companies, this is an alternative to paying dividends, and it can eventually reduce equity (buybacks are subtracted from equity) enough to turn the calculation negative.

In all cases, negative or extremely high ROE levels should be considered a warning sign worth investigating. In rare cases, a negative ROE ratio could be due to a [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] supported share buyback program and excellent management, but this is the less likely outcome. In any case, a company with a negative ROE cannot be evaluated against other [[Stocks|stocks]] with positive ROE ratios.

## Limitations of ROE

A high ROE might not always be positive. An outsized ROE can be indicative of a number of issues—such as inconsistent profits or excessive [[Debt|debt]]. Also, a negative ROE due to the company having a net loss or negative shareholders’ [[Equity|equity]] cannot be used to analyze the company, nor can it be used to compare against companies with a positive ROE.

## ROE vs. [[Return]] on Invested Capital

While [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]] looks at how much profit a company can generate relative to shareholders’ equity, [[return on invested capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp) (ROIC) takes that calculation a couple of steps further.

The purpose of ROIC is to figure out the amount of money after dividends a company makes based on all its sources of capital, which includes shareholders [[Equity|equity]] and [[Debt|debt]]. ROE looks at how well a company uses shareholder equity while ROIC is meant to determine how well a company uses all its available capital to make money.

## Example of ROE in Use

For example, imagine a company with an annual income of $1,800,000 and average shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] of $12,000,000. This company’s ROE would be as follows:

ROE\=($1,800,000$12,000,000)\=15%ROE=\\left(\\frac{\\$1,800,000}{\\$12,000,000}\\right )=15\\%

Consider Apple Inc. ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl))—for the fiscal year ending Sept. 29, 2018, the company generated US$59.5 billion in net income. At the end of the fiscal year, its shareholders’ [[Equity|equity]] was $107.1 billion versus $134 billion at the beginning.1 Apple’s [[Return|return]] on equity, therefore, is 49.4%, or $59.5 billion / (($107.1 billion + $134 billion) / 2).

Compared to its peers, Apple has a very strong ROE.

-   Amazon.com Inc. ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn)) had a [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]] of 27% in 2018,2
-   Microsoft Corp. ([MSFT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=msft)) 23% in Q3 2018,3 and
-   Google—now know as Alphabet Inc. ([GOOGL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=googl)) 12% for 2018 Q3.4

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a good [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]] (ROE)?

As with most other performance metrics, what counts as a “good” ROE [[Will|will]] depend on the company’s industry and competitors. While the long-term average ROE for companies in the S&P 500 has been around 14%, specific industries can be significantly higher or lower than this average. All else being equal, an industry will likely have a lower average ROE if it is highly competitive and requires substantial assets in order to generate revenues. On the other hand, industries with relatively few players and where only limited assets are needed to generate revenues may show a higher average ROE.

### How do you calculate ROE?

To calculate ROE, analysts simply divide the company’s net income by its average [[shareholders’ equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp). Since shareholders’ [[Equity|equity]] is equal to assets minus liabilities, ROE is essentially a measure of the [[Return|return]] generated on the net assets of the company. The reason average shareholders’ equity is used is that this figure might fluctuate during the accounting period in question.

### What is the difference between [[Return]] on Assets (ROA) and ROE?

[ROA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp) and ROE are similar, in that they are both trying to gauge how efficiently the company generates its profits. However, whereas ROE compares net income to the _net_ assets of the company, ROA compares net income to the company’s assets alone, without deducting its liabilities. In both cases, companies in industries where significant assets are needed for operations [[Will|will]] likely show a lower average [[Return|return]].
