[[Golden Cross]]
## What Is a [[Golden Cross]]?

The [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] is a chart pattern that is a bullish signal in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a [[Security|security]]'s short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a [[bull market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading [[volumes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] is a technical chart pattern indicating the potential for a major [[Rally|rally]].
-   The [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] appears on a chart when a [[Stock|stock]]’s short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average.
-   The [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] can be contrasted with a death cross indicating a bearish price movement.

## What Does a [[Golden Cross]] Tell You?

There are three stages to a [[Golden Cross|golden cross]]. The first stage requires that a [[downtrend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtrend.asp) eventually bottoms out as selling is depleted. In the second stage, the shorter moving average forms a crossover up through the larger moving average to trigger a breakout and confirmation of trend [[Reversal|reversal]]. The last stage is the continuing uptrend for the follow through to higher prices. The moving averages act as support levels on pullbacks, until they crossover back down at which point a [[death cross]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathcross.asp) may form. The [[death cross is the opposite of the golden cross]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121114/what-difference-between-golden-cross-and-death-cross-pattern.asp) as the shorter moving average forms a crossover down through the longer moving average.

The most commonly used moving averages are the 50-period and the 200-period moving average. The period represents a specific time increment. Generally, larger time periods tend to form stronger lasting breakouts. For example, the daily 50-day moving average crossover up through the 200-day moving average on an index like the S&P 500 is one of the most popular bullish market signals. With a [[bellwether index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bellwether.asp), the motto "A rising tide lifts all boats" applies when a [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] forms as the buying resonates throughout the index components and sectors.

Day traders commonly use smaller time periods like the 5-period and 15-period moving averages to trade intra-day [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] breakouts. The time interval of the charts can also be adjusted from 1 minute to weeks or months. Just as larger periods make for stronger signals, the same applies to chart time periods as well. The larger the chart time frame, the stronger and lasting the golden cross breakout tends to be.

## Example of a [[Golden Cross]]

As a hypothetical example, a monthly 50-period and 200-period moving average [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] is significantly stronger and longer lasting than the same 50, 200-period moving average crossover on a 15-minute chart. Golden cross breakout signals can be utilized with various [[Momentum|momentum]] oscillators like stochastic, [[moving average convergence divergence (MACD)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) and [[relative strength index (RSI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) to track when the uptrend is [[Overbought|overbought]] and oversold. This helps to spot ideal entries and exits.

## The Difference Between a [[Golden Cross]] and a Death Cross

A [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] and a death cross are exact opposites. A golden cross indicates a long-term [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) going forward, while death cross signals a long-term [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp). Both refer to the solid confirmation of a long-term trend by the occurrence of a short-term [moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) crossing over a major long-term moving average.

The [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] occurs when a short-term moving average crosses over a major long-term moving average to the [[Upside|upside]] and is interpreted by analysts and traders as signaling a definitive upward turn in a market. Conversely, a similar downside moving average [crossover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossover.asp) constitutes the death cross and is understood to signal a decisive downturn in a market. Either crossover is considered more significant when accompanied by high trading volume. Once the crossover occurs, the long-term moving average is considered a major [support level](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp) (in the case of the golden cross) or [resistance level](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp) (in the instance of the death cross) for the market from that point forward. Either cross may occur as a signal of a trend change, but they more frequently occur as a strong confirmation of a change in trend that has already taken place.

## Limitations Of Using The [[Golden Cross]]

All indicators are “lagging,” and no indicator can truly predict the future. Many times, an observed [[Golden Cross|golden cross]] produces a false signal, and a trader placing a long at that time could subsequently find himself in some near-term trouble. Despite its apparent predictive power in forecasting prior large bull markets, golden crosses also do regularly fail to manifest. Therefore, a golden cross should always be confirmed with other signals and indicators before putting on a trade. The key to using the golden cross correctly_—_with additional filters and indicators_—_is to always use proper [[Risk|risk]] parameters and ratios. Remembering to always keep to a favorable [risk-to-reward ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskrewardratio.asp) and to time your trade properly can lead to better results than just following the cross blindly.
