[[Inside Purchase Money Security Interest]]
## What Is a Purchase Money [[Security]] Interest (PMSI)?

The term purchase money [[Security|security]] interest (PMSI) refers to a legal claim that allows a [[Lender|lender]] to either repossess property financed with its [[Loan|loan]] or to demand [[repayment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp) in cash if the borrower defaults. It gives the [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp) priority over claims made by other creditors. In simpler terms, a PSMI gives initial claims on property to entities that [[Finance|finance]] purchases made by a consumer or other [[debtor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debtor|debtor]].asp).

## Understanding Purchase Money [[Security]] Interest

Lenders have several options to protect their financial interests in the event that debtors fail to live up to their financial obligations. Financial companies may be able to pursue consumers who stop making payments on their [[debts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp) by sending them to collections, taking legal action, enforcing [[liens]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp), or by taking out special interests such as purchase money [[Security|security]] interests. This interest gives a specific [[Lender|lender]] a right to [[property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property.asp) or its full cash value before any other [[creditor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp)—as long as that lender's money was used to [[Finance|finance]] the purchase.

A PMSI is used by some commercial lenders and [[credit card]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp) issuers as well as by retailers who [[Offer|offer]] financing options. It effectively gives them [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp) to confiscate if a borrower [[defaults]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on payment for a large purchase. It also is used in [[business-to-business]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btob.asp) (B2B) transactions. The option of obtaining a PMSI encourages companies to increase sales by directly financing new equipment or inventory purchases.

A purchase money [[Security|security]] interest is valid in most jurisdictions once the buyer agrees to it in writing and the [[Lender|lender]] files a financing statement. The procedure is outlined in [[Article 9]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/article-9.asp) of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uniform-commercial-code.asp) (UCC)—the standardized business regulations adopted by most states. These regulations were adopted in order to make it easier for corporations to conduct business with others across state lines. Article 9 is the section of the code that outlines the treatment of secured transactions including how [[security interests]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security-interest.asp) are created and enforced.

The procedures permitting enforcement of a PMSI are strict and outlined in the Uniform Commercial Code.

The protection provided by a PMSI is one reason for the growth of [[point of sale]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/point-of-sale.asp) financing, in which a retailer offers buyers direct financing for major purchases. If the purchaser defaults, the retailer may repossess the items purchased and may do so before any other creditors are satisfied.

### Key Takeaways

-   A PMSI gives a retailer or supplier priority for collecting on [[Debt|debt]] when a borrower or buyer defaults.
-   The goods sold in such cases serve as [[Collateral|collateral]] that can be seized for nonpayment.
-   Retailers who [[Offer|offer]] point-of-sale financing are generally protected by a PMSI.

## Special Considerations

The rules regarding a [[Lender|lender]]'s use of a PMSI are strict. These guidelines are outlined in the UCC. The lender must be able to prove that the goods seized were owned by the lender and were purchased using the lender's money. This is why lenders routinely pay [[vendors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vendor.asp) for goods directly before arranging for their sale on credit to a buyer. This establishes the lender's ownership of the goods in question.

For example, if a consumer arranged to buy a custom-made sofa on credit from a furniture retailer, the retailer would put through an order with the manufacturer and pay for the sofa before finalizing the [[financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp) agreement. In this case, the retailer is the owner selling the sofa—not the manufacturer. In legal terms, the retailer has a [[Security|security]] interest in the property just sold and can obtain and enforce a PMSI.

For the same reason, if the buyer puts down a [[security deposit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]]-deposit.asp) on the sofa, the retailer may insist that the buyer pays for it in full before the security deposit is returned. This establishes the full dollar value that the [[Lender|lender]] is entitled to demand in case of [[Default|default]]. Court rulings regarding PMSI claims have established the lender's right to demand [[reimbursement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Reimbursement|reimbursement]].asp) of other costs related to the purchase such as freight charges and sales taxes.
