[[Zero Plus Tick]]
## What Is a [[Zero Plus Tick]]?

A [[Zero Plus Tick|zero plus tick]] or zero [[uptick]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptick.asp) is a [[Security|security]] trade that is executed at the same price as the preceding trade but at a higher price than the last trade of a different price. For example, if a succession of trades occurs at $10, $10.01, and $10.01 again, the latter trade would be considered a zero plus tick, or [[Zero Uptick|zero uptick]] trade, because it is the same price as the previous trade, but a higher price than the last trade at a different price.

The term [[Zero Plus Tick|zero plus tick]] or [[Zero Uptick|zero uptick]] can be applied to [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, commodities, and other traded securities, but most often is used for [[Listed|listed]] [[Equity|equity]] securities. The opposite of a zero plus tick is a zero minus tick.

### Key Takeaways

-   A zero tick plus is when a [[Security|security]] has a transaction above the national best bid (uptick), and then another transaction occurs at that same price.
-   Up until 2007, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]] had a rule stating that a [[Stock|stock]] could only be shorted on an uptick or a [[Zero Plus Tick|zero plus tick]] in order to prevent the destabilization of a stock.1
-   As of 2010, an alternate [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] states that if a [[Stock|stock]] has declined more than 10% that day traders may only short on an uptick. They may short freely if the stock hasn't declined by more than 10%.2

## Understanding a [[Zero Plus Tick]]

An uptick, and [[Zero Plus Tick|zero plus tick]], means the price of a [[Stock|stock]] moved higher and then stayed there, albeit briefly. It was for this reason that, for more than 70 years, there was an [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] as established by the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC), which stated that [[Stocks|stocks]] could only be [[shorted]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) on an uptick or a zero plus tick, not on a [[downtick]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtick.asp).1

The [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] was intended to stabilize the market by preventing traders from destabilizing a [[Stock|stock]]â€™s price by shorting it on a downtick. Prior to the implementation of the uptick rule, it was common for groups of traders to pool capital and sell short in order to drive down the price of a specific [[Security|security]]. The goal of this was to cause a panic among shareholders, who would then sell their [[Shares|shares]] at a lower price. This manipulation of the market caused securities to decline even further in value.1

It was thought that [[Short Selling|short selling]] on downticks may have led to the [[Stock|stock]] market crash of 1929, following inquiries into short selling that occurred during the 1937 market break. The [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] was implemented in 1938 and lifted in 2007 after the SEC concluded that markets were advanced and orderly enough to not need the restriction. It is also believed that the advent of decimalization on the major stock exchanges helped to make the rule unnecessary.13

During the [2008 financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/09/financial-crisis-review.asp), widespread calls for the reinstatement of the [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] led the SEC to implement an alternative [[uptick rule]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickrule.asp) in 2010. This rule stated that if a [[Stock|stock]] dropped more than 10% in a day, [[Short Selling|short selling]] would only be allowed on an uptick. Once the 10% drop has been triggered the alternate uptick rule remains in effect for the rest of the day and the following day.2

## Example of a [[Zero Plus Tick]]

Assume that Company ABC has a bid price of $273.36 and an [[Offer|offer]] of $273.37. Transactions have occurred at both of these prices in the last second as the price holds there. A transaction occurring at $273.37 is an uptick. If another transaction occurs at $273.37, that is a zero tick plus.

In most circumstances, this doesn't matter. But say the [[Stock|stock]] has fallen by 10% from the [[prior close price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/previousclose.asp) at one point in the day. Then the upticks matter because a trader could only short if the price is on an uptick. Essentially this means they can only get filled on the [[offer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ask.asp) side. They can't cross the market to remove [[Liquidity|liquidity]] off the [[bid]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid.asp). This is per the alternative [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] established in 2010.
