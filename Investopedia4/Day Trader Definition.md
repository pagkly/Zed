[[Day Trader Definition]]
## What Is a Day Trader?

A day trader is a type of trader who executes a relatively large volume of short and long trades to capitalize on [[intraday]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intraday.asp) market [[Price Action|price action]]. The goal is to profit from very short-term price movements. Day traders can also use [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp) to amplify returns, which can also amplify losses.

While many strategies are employed by day traders, the [[Price Action|price action]] sought after is a result of temporary [[supply and demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-[[Supply|supply]]-demand.asp) inefficiencies caused due to purchases and sales of the asset. Typically positions are held from periods of milliseconds to hours and are generally closed out before the end of the day, so that no [[Risk|risk]] is held after hours or overnight.

### Key Takeaways

-   Day traders are traders who execute intraday strategies to profit off relatively short-lived price changes for a given asset.
-   Day traders employ a wide variety of techniques in order to capitalize on market inefficiencies, often making many trades a day and closing positions before the trading day ends.
-   Day trading is often characterized by [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] and requires a high degree of self-discipline and objectivity.
-   Day trading can be a lucrative undertaking, but it also comes with a high degree of [[Risk|risk]] and uncertainty.

## Basics of a Day Trader

There is no special qualification required to [[become a day trader]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/051415/10-steps-becoming-day-trader.asp). Instead, day traders are classified based on the frequency of their trading. The [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp) (FINRA) and [[New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE) classify day traders based on whether they trade four or more times during a five-day span, provided the number of day trades is more than 6% of the customer's total trading activity during that period or the brokerage/investment firm where they have opened an account considers them a day trader.

A day trader often closes all trades before the end of the trading day, so as not to [[Hold|hold]] [[open positions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-position.asp) overnight. A day traders' effectiveness may be limited by the [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp), trading commissions, as well as expenses for real-time news feeds and analytics software. Successful day trading requires extensive knowledge and experience. Day traders employ a variety of methods to make trading decisions. Some traders employ computer trading models that use [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]] to calculate favorable probabilities, while some trade on their instinct.

A day trader is primarily concerned with the [[price action]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp) characteristics of a [[Stock|stock]]. This is unlike investors, who use [[fundamental]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) data to analyze the long-term growth potential of a company to decide whether to buy, sell or [[Hold|hold]] its stock.

Price [[Volatility|volatility]] and average day [[range]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/range.asp) are critical to a day trader. A [[Security|security]] must have sufficient price movement for a day trader to achieve a profit. [[Volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) and [[Liquidity|liquidity]] are also crucial because entering and exiting trades quickly is vital to capturing small profits per trade. Securities with a small daily range or light daily volume would not be of interest to a day trader.

### Pattern Day Trader Designation

A [[pattern day trader]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patterndaytrader.asp) (PDT) is a regulatory designation for those traders or investors that execute four or more day trades over the span of five business days using a [[margin account]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp).

The number of day trades must constitute more than 6% of the margin account's total trade activity during that five-day window. If this occurs, the trader's account [[Will|will]] be flagged as a PDT by their [[broker]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp). The PDT designation places certain restrictions on further trading; this designation is put in place to discourage investors from trading excessively.

## Day Trader Techniques

Day traders are attuned to events that cause short-term market moves. Trading the news is a popular technique. Scheduled announcements such as economic statistics, corporate earnings, or [[interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) are subject to market expectations and [[market psychology]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketpsychology.asp). Markets react when those expectations are not met or are exceeded, usually with sudden, significant moves, which can benefit day traders.

Another trading method is known as fading the gap at the open. When the opening price shows a [[gap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gap.asp) from the previous day’s close, taking a position in the opposite direction of the gap is known as fading the gap. For days when there is no news or there are no gaps, early in the morning, day traders [[Will|will]] take a view on the general direction of the market.

If they expect the market to move up, they would buy securities that exhibit strength when their prices dip. If the market is trending down, they would [[short]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) securities that exhibit weakness when their prices bounce.

Most independent day traders have short days, working two to five hours per day. Often they [[Will|will]] practice making simulated trades for several months before beginning to make live trades. They track their successes and failures versus the market, aiming to learn by experience.

## Day Trader Strategies

Day traders use several intraday strategies. These may include:

-   [**Scalping**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalping.asp): this strategy attempts to make numerous small profits on small price changes throughout the day, and may also include identifying short-lived [[arbitrage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp) opportunities.
-   [**Range trading**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rangeboundtrading.asp): this strategy primarily uses support and resistance levels to determine buy and sell decisions. This trading style may also go by the name [[swing trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swingtrading.asp) if positions are held for weeks rather than hours or days.
-   [**News-based trading**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/news-trader.asp): this strategy typically seizes trading opportunities from the heightened [[Volatility|volatility]] around news events and headlines.
-   [**High-frequency trading (HFT)**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-frequency-trading.asp): these strategies use sophisticated [algorithms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithm.asp) to exploit small or short-term market inefficiencies up to several thousand times in a single day.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Day Trading

The most significant benefit of day trading is that positions are not affected by the possibility of negative overnight news that has the potential to impact the price of securities materially. Such news includes vital economic and earnings reports, as well as broker upgrades and downgrades that occur either before the market opens or after the market closes.

Trading on an intraday basis offers several other key advantages. One advantage is the ability to use tight [[stop-loss orders]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/stoplossorderdetails.asp)—the act of raising a stop price to minimize losses from a [[long position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp). Another includes the increased access to margin—and hence, greater [[Leverage|leverage]]. Day trading also provides traders with more learning opportunities. 

However, with every silver lining, there are also storm clouds. While [[day trading can be highly profitable]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/053115/average-rate-[[Return|return]]-day-traders.asp), it still comes with plenty of risks.

Disadvantages of day trading include insufficient time for a position to see increases in profit, in some cases any profit at all, and increased [[Commission|commission]] costs due to trading more frequently, which eats away at the profit margins a trader can expect. Day traders that engage in [[short selling]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100913/basics-short-selling.asp) or use margin to [[Leverage|leverage]] long positions can see losses amplify quickly, leading to [[margin calls]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp).

Pros

-   Positions are usually closed at the end of each day, and are so unaffected by [[Risk|risk]] from overnight news or off-hours broker moves.
    
-   Tight stop-loss orders can protect positions from extreme movements.
    
-   Regular traders have access to increased [[Leverage|leverage]] and lower commissions.
    
-   Numerous trades increase hands-on learning experience.
    

Cons

-   Frequent trades do mean multiple [[Commission|commission]] costs.
    
-   Some assets are off-limits, like mutual funds.
    
-   There may not be sufficient time for a position to realize a profit before it has to be closed out.
    
-   Losses can mount quickly, especially if margin is used to [[Finance|finance]] purchases. Margin calls are a real [[Risk|risk]].
