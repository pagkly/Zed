[[Rate of Return (RoR)]]
## What Is a [[Rate of Return (RoR)]]?

A [[Rate of Return (RoR)|rate of return (RoR)]] is the net [[Gain|gain]] or loss of an investment over a specified time period, expressed as a percentage of the investment’s initial cost. When calculating the rate of [[Return|return]], you are determining the percentage change from the beginning of the period until the end.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Rate of Return (RoR)|rate of return (RoR)]] is used to measure the profit or loss of an investment over time.
-   The metric of RoR can be used on a variety of assets, from [[Stocks|stocks]] to bonds, real [[Estate|estate]], and art.
-   The effects of inflation are not taken into consideration in the simple rate of [[Return|return]] calculation but are in the real rate of return calculation.
-   The internal rate of [[Return|return]] (IRR) takes into consideration the time value of money.

## Understanding a [[Rate of Return (RoR)]]

A [[Rate of Return (RoR)|rate of return (RoR)]] can be applied to any investment vehicle, from real [[Estate|estate]] to bonds, [[Stocks|stocks]], and [[fine art]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/fine-art.asp). RoR works with any asset provided the asset is purchased at one point in time and produces [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] at some point in the future. Investments are assessed based, in part, on past rates of [[Return|return]], which can be compared against assets of the same type to determine which investments are the most attractive. Many investors like to pick a [[required rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredrateofreturn.asp) before making an investment choice.

## The Formula for [[Rate of Return (RoR)]]

The formula to calculate the [[Rate of Return (RoR)|rate of return (RoR)]] is:

Rate of [[Return|return]]\=\[(Current value−Initial value)Initial value\]×100\\text{Rate of return} = \[\\frac{(\\text{Current value} - \\text{Initial value})}{\\text{Initial value}}\]\\times 100

This simple rate of [[Return|return]] is sometimes called the basic [[growth rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aagr.asp), or alternatively, [[return on investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) (ROI). If you also consider the effect of the time value of money and inflation, the real rate of return can also be defined as the net amount of [[discounted cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) (DCF) received on an investment after adjusting for inflation.

## [[Rate of Return (RoR)]] on [[Stocks]] and Bonds

The rate of [[Return|return]] calculations for [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds is slightly different. Assume an investor buys a [[Stock|stock]] for $60 a share, owns the stock for five years, and earns a total amount of $10 in [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp). If the investor sells the stock for $80, his per share [[Gain|gain]] is $80 - $60 = $20. In addition, he has earned $10 in dividend income for a total gain of $20 + $10 = $30. The rate of return for the stock is thus a $30 gain per share, divided by the $60 cost per share, or 50%.

On the other hand, consider an investor that pays $1,000 for a $1,000 par value 5% [[coupon bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/couponbond.asp). The investment earns $50 in interest income per year. If the investor sells the bond for $1,100 in [[Premium|premium]] value and earns $100 in total interest, the investor’s rate of [[Return|return]] is the $100 [[Gain|gain]] on the sale, plus $100 interest income divided by the $1,000 initial cost, or 20%.

## Real [[Rate of Return (RoR)]] vs. Nominal Rate of [[Return]] (RoR)

The simple rate of [[Return|return]] is considered a [nominal rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominal-rate-of-return.asp) since it does not account for the effect of inflation over time. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money, and so $335,000 six years from now is not the same as $335,000 today.

Discounting is one way to account for the time value of money. Once the effect of inflation is taken into account, we call that the [[real rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realrateofreturn.asp) (or the inflation-adjusted rate of [[Return|return]]).

## Real [[Rate of Return (RoR)]] vs. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

A closely related concept to the simple rate of [[Return|return]] is the [[compound annual growth rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp) (CAGR). The CAGR is the mean annual rate of return of an investment over a specified period of time longer than one year, which means the calculation must factor in growth over multiple periods.

To calculate compound annual growth rate, we divide the value of an investment at the end of the period in question by its value at the beginning of that period; raise the result to the power of one divided by the number of holding periods, such as years; and subtract one from the subsequent result.

## Example of a [[Rate of Return (RoR)]]

The rate of [[Return|return]] can be calculated for any investment, dealing with any kind of asset. Let's take the example of purchasing a home as a basic example for understanding how to calculate the RoR. Say that you buy a house for $250,000 (for simplicity let's assume you pay 100% cash).

Six years later, you decide to sell the house—maybe your family is growing and you need to move into a larger place. You are able to sell the house for $335,000, after deducting any [[Realtor|realtor]]'s fees and taxes. The simple rate of [[Return|return]] on the purchase and sale of the house is as follows:

(335,000−250,000)250,000×100\=34%\\frac{(335,000-250,000)}{250,000} \\times 100 = 34\\%

Now, what if, instead, you sold the house for less than you paid for it—say, for $187,500? The same equation can be used to calculate your loss, or the negative rate of [[Return|return]], on the transaction: 

(187,500−250,000)250,000×100\=−25%\\frac{(187,500 - 250,000)}{250,000} \\times 100 = -25\\%

## Internal Rate of [[Return]] (IRR) and [[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)]]

The next step in understanding RoR over time is to account for the [[time value of money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) (TVM), which the CAGR ignores. Discounted cash flows take the earnings of an investment and discount each of the cash flows based on a [[discount rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp). The [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] represents a minimum rate of [[Return|return]] acceptable to the investor, or an assumed rate of inflation. In addition to investors, businesses use discounted cash flows to assess the profitability of their investments.

Assume, for example, a company is considering the purchase of a new piece of equipment for $10,000, and the firm uses a [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] of 5%. After a $10,000 cash outflow, the equipment is used in the operations of the business and increases cash inflows by $2,000 a year for five years. The business applies present value table factors to the $10,000 outflow and to the $2,000 inflow each year for five years.

The $2,000 inflow in year five would be discounted using the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] at 5% for five years. If the sum of all the adjusted cash inflows and outflows is greater than zero, the investment is profitable. A positive [[net cash]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-cash.asp) inflow also means that the rate of [[Return|return]] is higher than the 5% discount rate.

The rate of [[Return|return]] using discounted cash flows is also known as the [[internal rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp) (IRR). The internal rate of return is a [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] that makes the [[net present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) (NPV) of all cash flows from a particular project or investment equal to zero. IRR calculations rely on the same formula as NPV does and utilizes the time value of money (using interest rates). The formula for IRR is as follows:

IRR\=NPV\=∑t\=1TCt(1+r)t−C0\=0where:T\=total number of time periodst\=time periodCt\=net cash inflow-outflows during a single period tC0\=baseline cash inflow-outflowsr\=discount rate\\begin{aligned} &IRR = NPV = \\sum\_{t = 1}^T \\frac{C\_t}{(1+ r)^t} - C\_0 = 0 \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &T=\\text{total number of time periods}\\\\ &t = \\text{time period}\\\\ &C\_t = \\text{[[Net Cash|net cash]] inflow-outflows during a single period }t \\\\ &C\_0 = \\text{baseline cash inflow-outflows}\\\\ &r = \\text{[[Discount Rate|discount rate]]}\\\\ \\end{aligned}
