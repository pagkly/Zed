[[Good Faith Money]]
## What Is [[Good Faith Money]]?

[[Good Faith Money|Good faith money]] is a deposit of money into an account by a buyer to show that they have the intention of completing a deal. Good faith money is often later applied to the purchase but may be non-refundable if the deal does not go through.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Good Faith Money|Good faith money]] acts as a [[Security|security]] deposit towards completing a purchase.
-   This payment is usually nonrefundable but credited towards the final [[Purchase Price|purchase price]].
-   When the seller wants to both qualify and motivate a buyer, the deposit amount asked for [[Will|will]] be larger.
-   Depending on the [[Supply|supply]] and demand, [[Good Faith Money|good faith money]] amounts can vary as a percentage of the final price.
-   Both seller and buyer should specify [[Good Faith Money|good faith money]] terms in writing.
-   [[Good Faith Money|Good faith money]] often acts as a strong motivator for a buyer to close the deal as it represents a possible sunk cost; the higher the cost, the more likely they are to go through with the purchase.

## Understanding [[Good Faith Money]]

[[Good Faith Money|Good faith money]] can also be known as earnest money and acts similar to a [[security deposit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]]-deposit.asp) on a rental property. Where a security deposit for a rental home, vehicle, or equipment may be taken as [[insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp) against damages, good faith money is usually taken as insurance against a lost opportunity should the buyer not go through with completing a purchase.

In most cases, the deposit amount [[Will|will]] be a percentage of the total amount owed—a small percentage for something large like a house or [[Lease|lease]] contract, and a larger percentage for smaller purchases of consumable items. A common example of [[Good Faith Money|good faith money]] is the so-called "earnest money" [escrow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp) deposit required by most home sellers to enter into a sales contract with a buyer.

## [[Good Faith Money]] Amounts

The amount of [[Good Faith Money|good faith money]] used to initiate a contract with a seller [[Will|will]] vary considerably depending on the asset, the local market, and the credibility of the buyer. For example, when the [[housing market]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040215/how-does-law-[[Supply|supply]]-and-demand-affect-housing-market.asp) in a given locale is very hot and multiple buyers make offers on the same properties, the expected earnest money deposit, in some areas, can rise higher than the standard 1% to 3% of the potential [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of the home.1

In expensive neighborhoods, this can be such a substantial amount that the buyer has much more incentive to merely make the purchase, rather than delay while working out [[financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp). Those buyers who do not have financing available already are thus weeded out in favor of buyers with stronger financial footing.

## [[Good Faith Money]] as Motivation

This phenomenon reflects the fact that although the money is ostensibly for the seller to offset the opportunity cost of doing business with a different buyer, the higher demand allows the seller to command more earnest money, pushing the buyer to quickly make a decision right away.

This also creates a [[sunk-cost]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sunkcost.asp) bias in the buyers that may help them get past their buyer's remorse if they bid up the property too high. Either way, a large earnest money requirement works in favor of the seller and should be a bit of a warning sign that they are about to pay an extra [[Premium|premium]] for the property. For someone who is looking to make a shrewd purchase, this would be a warning sign to let the property go.

Most [[Good Faith Money|good faith money]] deposits are part of an agreement that spells out the conditions under which a buyer may lose their deposit if they are unable or unwilling to complete the contract. The written agreement is important for the buyer to ensure that the deposit [[Will|will]] actually go towards the purchase.

The potential buyer can sometimes get their [[Good Faith Money|good faith money]] back depending on the terms of the agreement. For example, if the home fails a [[Home Inspection|home inspection]] by a professional, it is usually a fair and justifiable reason to get the good faith money back.

A good faith deposit may seem a little like a [[call option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) because the buyer has the right to complete the ultimate purchase. However, unlike an option, [[Good Faith Money|good faith money]] is usually applied to the final [[Purchase Price|purchase price]], while a call option [[Premium|premium]] is not.
