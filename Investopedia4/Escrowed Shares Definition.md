[[Escrowed Shares Definition]]
## What Are Escrowed [[Shares]]?

Escrowed [[Shares|shares]] are shares held in an [[escrow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp) account, secured by a [[Third Party|third party]], pending the completion of a corporate action or an elapse of time leading up to an event. Shares are escrowed in three common cases: merger and acquisition transactions; bankruptcy or reorganization of a company; and granting of restricted shares to an employee of a firm.

### Key Takeaways

-   Escrowed [[Shares|shares]] are [[Stocks|stocks]] that are held in an escrow account.
-   Escrow means that the [[Shares|shares]] are held by a third-party until certain conditions have been met in order to reduce [[Counterparty|counterparty]] [[Risk|risk]] in a transaction.
-   Companies [[Will|will]] also issue [[Stock|stock]] in escrow, imposing limitations on when the [[Shares|shares]] can be sold, as part of an employee's compensation plan.
-   Mergers and acquisitions often require [[Shares|shares]] of the target company to be held in escrow until the deal is finalized.

## Understanding Escrowed [[Shares]]

Escrow is a process whereby money or a financial asset is held by a [[Third Party|third party]] on behalf of two other parties. The assets or funds that are held in escrow remain there and are not released until all of the obligations outlined in the agreement are fulfilled. Escrow reduces the [[Risk|risk]] in a transaction by having a third party [[Hold|hold]] assets, which prevents one party from having to pursue the other party for the funds or assets.

In [[Stock|stock]] transactions, the [[Equity|equity]] [[Shares|shares]] are held in escrow–essentially a holding account–until a transaction or other specific requirements have been satisfied. Many times, a stock issued in escrow [[Will|will]] be owned by the shareholder. However, the shareholder may be prevented from selling the stock immediately or may have limited access to selling the shares.

## Examples of Escrowed [[Shares]]

### Employee Compensation

Oftentimes, companies issue [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock|stock]] as a bonus or as part of the company's compensation program for executive employees. In these scenarios, the employees are typically required to wait a specified period of time before selling their shares. These shares are called [[restricted shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp) since the employee must wait until the [[vesting period]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp) has elapsed to own the shares. Between the [[Grant|grant]] date and vesting date, the shares are held in escrow. Upon the vesting date, the shares are released to the employee.

The reason companies [[Hold|hold]] their [[Stock|stock]] in escrow is that it provides an extra incentive for the employees to remain with the company for the long-term. [[Shares]] of stock can be held in escrow for anywhere between one to three years before an employee or executive can cash them out.

### Mergers and Acquisitions

A merger or acquisition can result in the buyer (acquirer) requesting a portion of the deal in consideration– typically 10% to 15%–to be held in escrow. Typically, [[Shares|shares]] of the seller or target company would be held. The escrowed shares protect the buyer from potential breaches in seller representation and [[warranties]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warranty.asp), [[covenants]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp), contingencies, and working capital adjustments, among other material adverse items that may affect the valuation of deal or the closing itself.

For example, funds for an acquisition can be held in escrow until government regulatory authorities approve the transaction. Other times, the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] might need to be adjusted at some point during the process, and as a result, funds are placed in escrow to cover for the variance.

A targeted company may also request that a holdback–in the form of acquirer [[Shares|shares]]–be held in escrow to protect against non-performance by the acquirer in a business combination. However, the holdback can be in the form of escrow shares, cash, or a combination of both. The practice of placing shares in escrow for a specified period of time is common for non-public companies as well as public ones.

### Bankruptcy or Reorganization

A company's [[Shares|shares]] may be suspended from trading during a [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) filing or a company reorganization, pending the resolution of the corporate action. In this case, a shareholder's holding [[Will|will]] be converted to escrow shares and then converted back to their original form if any [[Equity|equity]] remains in the company after the completion of the bankruptcy or reorganization process.
