[[Non-Deliverable Swap (NDS) Definition]]
## What Is a Non-Deliverable [[Swap]] (NDS)?

A non-deliverable [[Swap|swap]] (NDS) is a variation on a [[currency swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyswap.asp) between major and minor currencies that is restricted or not convertible. This means that there is no actual delivery of the two currencies involved in the swap, unlike a typical currency swap where there is physical exchange of currency flows. Instead, periodic settlement of a NDS is done on a cash basis, generally in U.S. dollars.

The settlement value is based on the difference between the exchange rate specified in the [[Swap|swap]] contract and [[the spot rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/spot-rate/), with one party paying the other the difference. A non-deliverable swap can be viewed as a series of [[non-deliverable forwards]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ndf.asp) bundled together.

### Key Takeaways

-   A non-deliverable [[Swap|swap]] (NDS) is a type of currency swap that is paid and settled in U.S. dollar equivalents rather than the two currencies involved in the swap itself.
-   As a result, the [[Swap|swap]] is considered non-convertible (restricted) since there is no physical delivery of the [[Underlying|underlying]] currencies.
-   NDS are typically used when the [[Underlying|underlying]] currencies are difficult to obtain, are illiquid, or are volatile - for instance, for developing country currencies or restricted currencies like Cuba or North Korea.

## Understanding Non-Deliverable Swaps (NDS)

Non-deliverable swaps are used by multi-national corporations to mitigate the [[Risk|risk]] that they may not be allowed to repatriate profits because of currency controls. They also use NDSs to [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) the risk of abrupt devaluation or [[depreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) in a restricted currency with little [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp), and to avoid the prohibitive cost of exchanging currencies in the local market. Financial institutions in nations with exchange restrictions use NDSs to hedge their foreign currency [[Loan|loan]] exposure.

The key variables in a NDS are:

-   the notional amounts (that is, the amounts of the transaction)
-   the two currencies involved (the non-deliverable currency and the settlement currency)
-   the settlement dates
-   the contract rates for the [[Swap|swap]], and
-   the fixing rates and dates – the specific dates on which the spot rates [[Will|will]] be sourced from reputable and independent market sources.

## NDS Example

Consider a financial institution – let’s call it LendEx – based in Argentina, that has taken a five-year US$10 million [[Loan|loan]] from a U.S. [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) at a fixed interest rate of 4% per annum payable semi-annually. LendEx has converted the U.S. dollar into Argentine pesos at the current exchange rate of 5.4, for lending to local businesses. However, it is concerned about the future depreciation of the peso, which [[Will|will]] make it more expensive to make the interest payments and [[Principal|principal]] repayment in U.S. dollars. It therefore enters into a currency [[Swap|swap]] with an overseas [[counterparty]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Counterparty|counterparty]].asp) on the following terms:

-   _Notional amounts (N)_ – US$400,000 for interest payments and US$10 million for the [[Principal|principal]] repayment.
-   _Currencies involved_ – Argentine peso and U.S. dollar.
-   _Settlement dates_ – 10 in all, the first one coinciding with the first interest payment and the 10th and final one coinciding with the final interest payment plus [[Principal|principal]] repayment.
-   _Contract rates for the [[Swap|swap]] (F)_ – For the sake of simplicity, say a contract rate of 6 (pesos per dollar) for the interest payments and 7 for the [[Principal|principal]] repayment.
-   _Fixing rates and dates (S)_ – Two days before the settlement date, sourced at 12 noon EST from Reuters.

The methodology for determining the NDS follows the following equation:

> Profit = (NS – NF) / S = N (1 – F/S)

Here’s how the NDS works out in this example. On the first fixing date – which is two days before the first interest payment / settlement date – assume the [[Spot Exchange Rate|spot exchange rate]] is 5.7 pesos to the U.S. dollar. Since LendEx has contracted to buy dollars at a rate of 6, it would have to pay the difference between this contract rate and the [[Spot Rate|spot rate]] times the notional interest amount to the [[Counterparty|counterparty]]. This net settlement amount would be in U.S. dollars and works out to -$20,000 \[i.e. (5.7 - 6.0) x 400,000 = -120,000 / 6 = -$20,000\].

On the second fixing date, assume the [[Spot Exchange Rate|spot exchange rate]] is 6.5 to the U.S. dollar. In this case, because the spot exchange rate is worse than the contracted rate, LendEx [[Will|will]] receive a net payment of $33,333 \[calculated as (6.5 – 6.0) x 400,000 = 200,000 / 6 = $33,333\].

This process continues until the final repayment date. A key point to note here is that because this is a non-deliverable [[Swap|swap]], settlements between the counterparties are made in U.S. dollars, and not in Argentine pesos.
