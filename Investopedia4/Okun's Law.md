# [[Okun's Law]] Definition

> ## Excerpt
> [[Okun's Law|Okun's law]] is the relationship between an economy's [[Unemployment|unemployment]] rate and its gross national product (GNP). The law only holds true for the U.S. economy and only applies when the unemployment rate is between 3% and 7.5%.

[[Okun's Law]]
## What Is [[Okun's Law]]?

[[Okun's Law|Okun's law]] pertains to the relationship between the U.S. economy's [[unemployment rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemploymentrate.asp) and its [[gross national product]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gnp.asp) (GNP). It states that when [[Unemployment|unemployment]] falls by 1%, GNP rises by 3%. However, the law only holds true for the U.S. economy and only applies when the unemployment rate is between 3% and 7.5%.

## [[Okun's Law]] Explained

[[Okun's Law|Okun's law]] can also pertain to how a rise in [[Unemployment|unemployment]] affects [gross domestic product](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) (GDP), where a percentage increase in unemployment causes a 2% fall in GDP.

Arthur Okun was a Yale professor and economist who studied the relationship between [[Unemployment|unemployment]] and production. He first published his research on the topic in the 1960s, and his findings were established as Okun’s law. It provides a general notion construing that when unemployment falls, the production of a country [[Will|will]] increase. This measure can be used for estimating both GNP and GDP.

The percentage increase by which GNP changes when [[Unemployment|unemployment]] falls by 1% is the Okun coefficient.

The relationship between [[Unemployment|unemployment]] and GNP or GDP varies by country. In the United States, the Okun coefficient estimates that when unemployment falls by 1%, GNP [[Will|will]] rise by 3% and GDP will rise by 2%. When unemployment rises by 1%, then GNP is expected to fall by 3% and GDP is expected to fall by 2%.

Industrialized nations with labor markets that are less flexible than those of the United States, such as France and Germany, tend to have higher Okun coefficients. In those countries, the same percentage change in GNP has a smaller effect on the [[Unemployment|unemployment]] rate than it does in the United States.

## [[Okun's Law]] Shortfalls 

Economists broadly support [[Okun's Law|Okun's law]], but it's considered to be inaccurate. This comes as numerous variables are involved with changes in GNP and GDP. Economists support an inverse relationship between [[Unemployment|unemployment]] and production, believing that when unemployment rises, GNP and GDP [[Will|will]] simultaneously fall, and when unemployment declines, GNP and GDP are expected to increase, but the exact amount varies. 

Further studies on the relationship of [[Unemployment|unemployment]] to production include a broader set of [[Labor Market|labor market]] variables to analyze the effects of the labor market on GNP and GDP. More detailed labor market variables include the level of the total labor market, hours worked by employed workers and [[Productivity|productivity]] levels for workers. Under further analysis, economists have found the change in production for every 1% change in unemployment to vary with more [[Volatility|volatility]] than [[Okun's Law|Okun's law]] sets forth.
