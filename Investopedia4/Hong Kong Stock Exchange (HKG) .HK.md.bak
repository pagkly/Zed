The [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKG) .HK]] is a member of the [[HKEX]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hkex.asp) Group and the leading venue for capital raising activity for Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese issuers. One of the world's largest securities markets by [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]], the Hong Kong [[Stock]] Exchange traces its origins to the founding of China's first formal securities market, the Association of Stockbrokers in Hong Kong, in 1891.

## BREAKING DOWN [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKG) .HK]]

The [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKG) .HK]] is one of the largest markets in Asia with over 2,500 [[Listed|listed]] companies of the end of Nov. 2020, up from 1,200 in 2008. The aggregate [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] of companies listed on the exchange was around HK$45.5 trillion as of Nov. 2020.6 The growth has been fueled by listings by Mainland Chinese companies ("[H-shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hshares.asp)" on the Hong Kong [[Stock]] Exchange) whose rapid development has gone hand-in-hand with the enormous economic rise of the country. The minimum market capitalization for a listing is currently HK$500 million and the minimum value of public float is HK$125 million. The exchange raised these minimum amounts in 2017 to strengthen trading [[Liquidity|liquidity]] for market participants and enhance the quality of the exchange's listed issuers.7
