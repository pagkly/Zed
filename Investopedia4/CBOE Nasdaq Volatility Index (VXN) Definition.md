[[CBOE Nasdaq Volatility Index (VXN) Definition]]
## What Is CBOE [[Nasdaq]] [[Volatility]] Index (VXN)?

The CBOE [[Nasdaq]] [[Volatility]] Index (VXN) is a measure of market expectations of 30-day [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) for the [[Nasdaq 100]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq100.asp) index, as implied by the prices of [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) [[Listed|listed]] on this index. The Chicago Board Options Exchange ([CBOE](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cboe.asp)) launched the VXN on January 23, 2001.1

### Key Takeaways

-   The CBOE [[Nasdaq]] [[Volatility]] Index (VXN) is a real-time [[Market Index|market index]] representing the market's expectations for volatility in the [[Nasdaq 100 Index|Nasdaq 100 index]] over the coming 30 days.1
-   The VXN was created as a counterpart to the [[Investopedia3/Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)|VIX]], which measures S&P 500 [[Volatility|volatility]], since the tech-heavy [[Nasdaq]] often diverges from the broader market.
-   The VXN, like the [[Investopedia3/Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)|VIX]], is computed using the implied volatilities of options [[Listed|listed]] on the [[Nasdaq 100 Index|Nasdaq 100 index]] and functions best as a “fear gauge” or indicator of market nervousness about the technology sector.

## Understanding CBOE [[Nasdaq]] [[Volatility]] Index (VXN)

The VXN index is a widely watched gauge of [[Market Sentiment|market sentiment]] and [[Volatility|volatility]] for the [[Nasdaq]]-100, which includes the top 100 U.S. and international non-financial securities by [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] [[Listed|listed]] on the Nasdaq. The VXN is quoted in percentage terms, just like its better-known counterpart the [[CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp), which measures 30-day implied volatility for the [[S&P 500 Index|S&P 500 index]].2

The CBOE [[Nasdaq]] [[Volatility]] Index was introduced in 2001 as the [[dot-com bubble]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in technology [[Stocks|stocks]] was deflating. CBOE developed the VXN because of the massive divergence between the volatility seen in the Nasdaq market compared to the broader U.S. [[Equity Market|equity market]] from early 1999 onward.

Indeed, the [[Nasdaq]] soared 137% in a 15-month period from January 1999 to its peak level of 5,132 in March 2000, before plunging 52% to just below 2,500 by December 2000.3 The [[S&P 500]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp), by comparison, only gained 26% from January 1999 to its March 2000 peak, and then declined 15% by the end of 2000.14

The higher the VXN level, the greater the expectation for [[Nasdaq]]-100 [[Volatility|volatility]]. Like the [[Investopedia3/Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)|VIX]], the VXN functions best as a “fear gauge” or indicator of market nervousness about the technology sector.

Since its introduction, the highest level reached by the VXN was 91.79 in September 2001, brought on by the 9/11 attack. Other notable peaks include 86.52 in October 2008, at the height of the global [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]], and 84.67 in March 2020, as the world reeled under the COVID-19 onslaught. The lowest level was 9.75 in March 2017. The average level for the VXN over this period was 21.14.5 By way of comparison, the average level for the [[Investopedia3/Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)|VIX]] over this time frame was 19.89.6 These two [[Volatility|volatility]] measures usually correlate closely with the VXN generally showing slightly higher volatility. The COVID-19 induced VXN spike proved to be short-lived as the gauge returned to levels in the 30s.5

## VXN Methodology and Interpretation

The methodology used by the CBOE to calculate the VXN—whose value it disseminates continuously during trading hours—is identical to that used for the [[Investopedia3/Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)|VIX]]. VXN components are near-term (with at least one week to expiration) put and call options, and next-term options in the first and second [[Nasdaq]]-100 contract months (options with more than 23 days and less than 37 days to expiration). The selected options are out-of-the-money Nasdaq-100 puts and calls centered on an at-the-money strike price.

Movement in the VXN represents the level of [[implied volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp) from the prices of [[Listed|listed]] options on the [[Nasdaq 100 Index|Nasdaq 100 index]]. Increases in the VXN and positive movement represents higher variances in the [[Underlying|underlying]] securities’ price from their average. This usually occurs with uncertainty. Decreases in the VXN and negative movement represents lower [[Volatility|volatility]] and a greater propensity for prices to trade in a tighter range. The VXN is generally followed along with the [[Nasdaq 100]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq100.asp) to understand volatility in relation to positive or negative movements in the prices of the index.
