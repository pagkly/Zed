[[Greensheet]]
## What Is a [[Greensheet]]?

A [[Greensheet|greensheet]] is a document prepared by an [[underwriter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp) to summarize the main components of a [[New Issue|new issue]] or [initial public offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO). Such documents are for internal use only, functioning as a marketing tool to help drum up interest from prospective institutional investors and [[brokers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Greensheet|greensheet]] is a document prepared by an underwriter to summarize the main components of a [[New Issue|new issue]] or initial public [[Offering|offering]] (IPO).
-   It is distributed to brokers and institutional sales desks of the underwriting firm to determine which clients may be interested in becoming large volume buyers.
-   The document generally includes a brief overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the [[New Issue|new issue]] and information on initial pricing.

## Understanding a [[Greensheet]]

Companies mainly [[issue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/newissue.asp) new [[Stock|stock]] or bonds to raise [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) for expansion. Any time a [[security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) is sold on the market for the first time, it can be described as a [[New Issue|new issue]]. That includes securities for IPOs: the process whereby a private corporation gives up part of its ownership by [[Offering|offering]] [[Shares|shares]] to the general public.

Though potentially lucrative, issuing new securities is a complicated and challenging process that requires significant legwork. Companies are legally obligated to follow certain protocols and file lots of paperwork when taking this route. Companies [[Will|will]] also do plenty of their own [[due diligence]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to ensure that this expensive, time-consuming task is worth pursuing.

One of the many important steps that must be taken is the hiring of an underwriter. These financial specialists work closely with the issuing body to determine the initial [offering price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offeringprice.asp) of the securities, buy the securities from the issuer, and then sell them to investors via their [[distribution network]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution-network.asp).

A key part of the underwriter’s job involves putting together a [[Greensheet|greensheet]]: an internal marketing document circulated to [[brokers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) and [[institutional]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) sales desks of the underwriting firm laying out the main information related to the [[Offering|offering]]. The purpose of a greensheet is to prepare salespeople to effectively market a new [[issue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issue.asp) to the public and to determine which clients may be interested in becoming large volume buyers.

## [[Greensheet]] vs. Prospectus

A [[Greensheet|greensheet]] is only an introduction to a new [[Security|security]] issue and is not intended to be comprehensive in nature. For a complete breakdown of what an investment [[Offering|offering]] represents, it is necessary to consult the [[prospectus]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp): a formal document required by and filed with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) that is made available to everyone.

The prospectus is used to help sell an investment to the general public. A [[Greensheet|greensheet]], on the other hand, is only designed for internal use and contains information considered most important to a [[registered representative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/registeredrepresentative.asp) (RR).

Generally, a [[Greensheet|greensheet]] [[Will|will]] contain a brief overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the [[New Issue|new issue]], including any benefits and risks, as well as insights on initial pricing. Armed with these basic details, an RR can then decide whether it wants to [[Offer|offer]] the issue to its clients.

### Important

A [[Greensheet|greensheet]] must not be circulated outside of the brokers and institutional sales desks of the underwriting firm. By law, it should only contain information that would appear in the issue's prospectus.

## Special Considerations

A [[Greensheet|greensheet]], by law, contains only information that would appear in the issue's prospectus. Its job is to make a balanced presentation of the contents found in a prospectus and not add anything new.

The [[Greensheet|greensheet]] should also contain a disclosure that explains the purpose of the document, the restrictions on its distribution, the limitations on the information it contains, and a statement that specifies that the information is not a solicitation of securities.
