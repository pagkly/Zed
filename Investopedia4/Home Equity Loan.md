[[Home Equity Loan]]
## What Is a [[Home Equity Loan]]?

A [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]]—also known as an [[Equity|equity]] [[Loan|loan]], [[Home Equity|home equity]] installment loan, or [[second mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondmortgage.asp)—is a type of consumer [[Debt|debt]]. Home equity loans allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their home. The loan amount is based on the difference between the home’s current market value and the homeowner’s mortgage balance due. Home equity loans tend to be fixed-rate, while the typical alternative, [[home equity lines of credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/) (HELOCs), generally have variable rates.

## How a [[Home Equity Loan]] Works

Essentially, a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]] is akin to a mortgage, hence the name second mortgage. The [[Equity|equity]] in the home serves as [[Collateral|collateral]] for the [[Lender|lender]]. The amount a homeowner is allowed to borrow [[Will|will]] be partially based on a [combined [[Loan|loan]]-to-value (CLTV) ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/combinedloantovalue.asp) of 80% to 90% of the home’s [[appraised]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp) value. Of course, the amount of the loan and the rate of interest charged also depend on the borrower’s [[credit score]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) and payment history.

Traditional [[Home Equity|home equity]] loans have a set repayment term, just like conventional mortgages. The borrower makes regular, fixed payments covering both [[Principal|principal]] and interest. As with any mortgage, if the [[Loan|loan]] is not paid off, the home could be sold to satisfy the remaining [[Debt|debt]].

A [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]] can be a good way to convert the [[Equity|equity]] you’ve built up in your home into cash, especially if you invest that cash in home renovations that increase the value of your home. However, always remember that you’re putting your home on the line—if real [[Estate|estate]] values decrease, you could end up owing more than your home is worth.

Should you want to relocate, you might end up losing money on the sale of the home or be unable to move. And if you’re getting the [[Loan|loan]] to pay off credit card [[Debt|debt]], resist the temptation to run up those credit card bills again. Before doing something that puts your house in jeopardy, weigh all of your options.

## Special Considerations

[[Home Equity|Home equity]] loans exploded in popularity after the [Tax Reform Act of 1986](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxreformact1986.asp) because they provided a way for consumers to get around one of its main provisions—the elimination of deductions for the interest on most consumer purchases. The act left in place one big exception: interest in the service of residence-based [[Debt|debt]]. 

However, the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/how-gop-tax-bill-affects-you/) suspended the deduction for interest paid on [[Home Equity|home equity]] loans and HELOCs until 2026, unless, according to the IRS, “they are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]’s home that secures the [[Loan|loan]].” The interest on a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]] used to consolidate debts or pay for a child’s college expenses, for example, is not tax-deductible.1

Before you take a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]], be sure to compare terms and interest rates. When looking, “don’t focus solely on large banks, but instead consider a [[Loan|loan]] with your local credit union,” recommends [[Clair Jones]](https://www.imove.com/blog/author/cjones/), a real [[Estate|estate]] and relocation expert who writes for Movearoo.com and iMove.com. “Credit unions sometimes [[Offer|offer]] better interest rates and more-personalized account service if you’re willing to deal with a slower application processing time.”

As with a mortgage, you can ask for a [good faith estimate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/good_faith_estimate.asp), but before you do, make your own honest estimate of your finances. [[Casey Fleming]](https://www.facebook.com/CaseyFleming.sbcglobal/), mortgage advisor at C2 Financial Corporation and author of _The [[Loan]] Guide: How to Get the Best Possible Mortgage_, says, “You should have a good sense of where your credit and home value are before applying, in order to save money. Especially on the appraisal \[of your home\], which is a major expense. If your appraisal comes in too low to support the loan, the money is already spent”—and there are no refunds for not qualifying.

Before signing—especially if you’re using the [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]] for [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]]—run the numbers with your bank and make sure the [[Loan|loan]]’s monthly payments [[Will|will]] indeed be lower than the combined payments of all your current obligations. Even though [[Home Equity|home equity]] loans have lower interest rates, your term on the new loan could be longer than that of your existing debts.

The interest on a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]] is only tax deductible if the [[Loan|loan]] is used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home that secures the loan.

## [[Home Equity]] Loans vs. HELOCs

[[Home Equity|Home equity]] loans provide a single lump-sum payment to the borrower, which is repaid over a set period of time (generally five to 15 years) at an agreed-upon interest rate. The payment and interest rate remain the same over the lifetime of the [[Loan|loan]]. The loan must be repaid in full if the home on which it is based is sold.

A HELOC is a revolving line of credit, much like a credit card, that you can draw on as needed, payback, and then draw on again, for a term determined by the [[Lender|lender]]. The draw period (five to 10 years) is followed by a repayment period when draws are no longer allowed (10 to 20 years). HELOCs typically have a variable interest rate, but some lenders [[Offer|offer]] [[HELOC fixed-rate options]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/fixed-rate-option/).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of a [[Home Equity Loan]]

There are a number of key benefits to [[Home Equity|home equity]] loans, including cost, but there are also drawbacks.

Pros

-   Easy to obtain
    
-   Lower interest rates than other [[Debt|debt]]
    
-   Possible tax deduction for interest paid
    

Cons

-   Easy to obtain
    
-   Possible spiraling [[Debt|debt]]—hence why "easy to obtain" is also a con
    
-   Can lead to home foreclosure
    

### Advantages

[[Home Equity|Home equity]] loans provide an easy source of cash and can be valuable tools for responsible borrowers. If you have a steady, reliable source of income and know that you [[Will|will]] be able to repay the [[Loan|loan]], low-interest rates and possible tax deductions make home [[Equity|equity]] loans a sensible choice.

Obtaining a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]] is quite simple for many consumers because it is a secured [[Debt|debt]]. The [[Lender|lender]] runs a credit check and orders an appraisal of your home to determine your [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]] and the combined [[Loan|loan]]-to-value ratio.

The interest rate on a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]]—although higher than that of a first mortgage—is much lower than that on credit cards and other consumer loans. That helps explain why the primary reason consumers borrow against the value of their homes via a fixed-rate [[Home Equity|home equity]] [[Loan|loan]] is to pay off credit card balances.

[[Home Equity|Home equity]] loans are generally a good choice if you know exactly how much you need to borrow and what you’ll use the money for. You’re guaranteed a certain amount, which you receive in full at closing. “Home [[Equity|equity]] loans are generally preferred for larger, more expensive goals such as remodeling, paying for higher education, or even [debt consolidation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtconsolidation.asp), since the funds are received in one lump sum,” says [[Richard Airey]](https://www.rickairey.com/), a [[Loan|loan]] officer with First Financial Mortgage in Portland, Maine.

### Disadvantages

The main problem with [[Home Equity|home equity]] loans is that they can seem an all-too-easy solution for a borrower who may have fallen into a perpetual cycle of spending, borrowing, spending, and sinking deeper into [[Debt|debt]]. Unfortunately, this scenario is so common that lenders have a term for it: “[reloading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reloading.asp),” which is basically the habit of taking out a [[Loan|loan]] in order to pay off existing debt and free up additional credit, which the borrower then uses to make additional purchases.

Reloading leads to a spiraling cycle of [[Debt|debt]] that often convinces borrowers to turn to [[Home Equity|home equity]] loans [[Offering|offering]] an amount worth 125% of the [[Equity|equity]] in the borrower’s house. This type of [[Loan|loan]] often comes with higher fees because—as the borrower has taken out more money than the house is worth—the loan is not fully secured by [[Collateral|collateral]]. Also, know that interest paid on the portion of the loan that is above the value of the home is never tax-deductible.

When applying for a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]], there can be some temptation to borrow more than you immediately need, as you only get the [[Payout|payout]] once, and you don’t know if you’ll qualify for another [[Loan|loan]] in the future.

If you are contemplating a [[Loan|loan]] that is worth more than your home, it might be time for a reality check. Were you unable to live within your means when you owed only 100% of the [[Equity|equity]] in your home? If so, it [[Will|will]] likely be unrealistic to expect that you’ll be better off when you increase your [[Debt|debt]] by 25%, plus interest and fees. This could become a slippery slope to bankruptcy and [foreclosure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp).

## Example of a [[Home Equity Loan]]

Say you have an auto [[Loan|loan]] with a balance of $10,000 at an interest rate of 9% with two years remaining on the term. Consolidating that [[Debt|debt]] to a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]] at a rate of 4% with a term of five years would actually cost you more money if you took all five years to pay off the [[Home Equity|home equity]] loan. Also, remember that your home is now [[Collateral|collateral]] for the loan instead of your car. Defaulting could result in its loss, and losing your home would be significantly more catastrophic then surrendering a car.
