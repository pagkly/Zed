## What Is a [[Z-Share]]?

A [[Z-Share|Z-share]] is a class of [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) [[Shares|shares]] that employees of the fund's management company are allowed to own. Employees may have the option to buy [[Z]]-shares. They are also used in employee benefit plans and offered as a part of compensation or through a reward package.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Z]]-[[Shares|shares]] are the class of mutual funds that employees of the fund's management company are allowed to own.
-   Typically, [[Z]]-[[Shares|shares]] are offered as part of employees' benefits packages, and some employers even match the number of Z-shares purchased. They can be a valuable [[Offering|offering]] for employees considering long-term employment prospects.
-   While [[Z-Share|Z-share]] investors [[Will|will]] pay the same management and miscellaneous fund expenses as other investors, [[Z]]-[[Shares|shares]] typically do not charge any front-end or back-end fees.

## How [[Z]]-[[Shares]] Work

[[Z]]-[[Shares|shares]] are typically no-load funds which can make them an even more attractive investment for employees. They usually have no [[front-end]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/front-endload.asp) or back-end fees. Generally, they also have one of the lowest [[expense ratios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp). While [[Z-Share|Z-share]] investors [[Will|will]] pay the same management and miscellaneous fund expenses as other investors, their expenses usually do not include distribution or service fees since they are bought and sold directly through the management company without the involvement of an intermediary.

Similar to [[Stock|stock]] options and stock incentive grants, mutual fund companies [[Offer|offer]] [[Z]]-[[Shares|shares]] as compensation or through a reward package. In some cases, employers may match the number of shares purchased as a [[bonus]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bonus.asp) for employees. Z-shares are held in employee benefits accounts. All [[Z-Share|Z-share]] transactions are managed by the fund company which provides reporting for the employees on the investments.

Other aspects of [[Z]]-[[Shares|shares]] are similar to the other share classes in the fund. [[Z-Share|Z-share]] assets are pooled by the fund for management and operational [[Economies of Scale|economies of scale]]. [[Open-End Fund|Open-end fund]] Z-shares must be transacted at the forward price, which is its next reported [[net asset value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp).

Overall, mutual fund companies structure their offerings to include [[Z]]-[[Shares|shares]] as a firm-wide incentive. Z-shares are a valuable instrument that mutual fund companies can use in all types of employee compensation. They are also used broadly in employee benefit plans. Z-shares can be a valuable [[Offering|offering]] for employees considering long-term employment prospects. Companies also use Z-shares to support employee morale, loyalty, and long-term career development.
