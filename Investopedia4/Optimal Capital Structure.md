[[Optimal Capital Structure]]
## What Is [[Optimal Capital Structure]]?

The [[Optimal Capital Structure|optimal capital structure]] of a firm is the best mix of [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] financing that maximizes a company’s market value while minimizing its [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]]. In theory, [[Debt Financing|debt financing]] offers the lowest cost of capital due to its tax deductibility. However, too much debt increases the financial [[Risk|risk]] to shareholders and the [[return on equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) that they require. Thus, companies have to find the optimal point at which the [[Marginal Benefit|marginal benefit]] of debt equals the marginal cost.

### Key Takeaways

-   An [[Optimal Capital Structure|optimal capital structure]] is the best mix of [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] financing that maximizes a company’s market value while minimizing its [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]].
-   Minimizing the [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] (WACC) is one way to optimize for the lowest cost mix of financing.
-   According to some economists, in the absence of taxes, bankruptcy costs, agency costs, and asymmetric information, in an efficient market, the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure.

#### [[Optimal Capital Structure]]

## Understanding [[Optimal Capital Structure]]

The [[Optimal Capital Structure|optimal capital structure]] is estimated by calculating the mix of [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] that minimizes the [[weighted average cost of capital (WACC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) of a company while maximizing its market value. The lower the [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]], the greater the present value of the firm’s future cash flows, discounted by the WACC. Thus, the chief goal of any corporate [[Finance|finance]] department should be to find the optimal capital structure that [[Will|will]] result in the lowest WACC and the maximum value of the company (shareholder wealth).

According to economists [Franco Modigliani](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/franco-modigliani.asp) and [Merton Miller](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merton-miller.asp), in the absence of taxes, [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) costs, agency costs, and asymmetric information, in an efficient market, the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure.1

## [[Optimal Capital Structure]] and WACC

The [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]] is less expensive than [[Equity|equity]] because it is less risky. The required [[Return|return]] needed to compensate [[Debt|debt]] investors is less than the required return needed to compensate equity investors, because interest payments have priority over dividends, and debt holders receive priority in the event of a liquidation. Debt is also cheaper than equity because companies get tax relief on interest, while dividend payments are paid out of after-tax income.

However, there is a limit to the amount of [[Debt|debt]] a company should have because an excessive amount of debt increases interest payments, the [[Volatility|volatility]] of earnings, and the [[Risk|risk]] of bankruptcy. This increase in the financial risk to shareholders means that they [[Will|will]] require a greater [[Return|return]] to compensate them, which increases the WACC—and lowers the market value of a business. The optimal structure involves using enough [[Equity|equity]] to mitigate the risk of being unable to pay back the debt—taking into account the variability of the business’s [[cash flow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp).

Companies with consistent cash flows can tolerate a much larger [[Debt|debt]] load and [[Will|will]] have a much higher percentage of debt in their [[Optimal Capital Structure|optimal capital structure]]. Conversely, a company with volatile cash flows will have little debt and a large amount of [[Equity|equity]].

## Determining the [[Optimal Capital Structure]]

As it can be difficult to pinpoint the [[Optimal Capital Structure|optimal capital structure]], managers usually attempt to operate within a range of values. They also have to take into account the signals their financing decisions send to the market.

A company with good prospects [[Will|will]] try to raise capital using [[Debt|debt]] rather than [[Equity|equity]], to avoid [[dilution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp) and sending any negative signals to the market. Announcements made about a company taking debt are typically seen as positive news, which is known as [[debt signaling]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtsignaling.asp). If a company raises too much capital during a given time period, the costs of debt, [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], and common equity will begin to rise, and as this occurs, the marginal [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] will also rise.

To gauge how risky a company is, potential [[Equity|equity]] investors look at the [[debt/equity ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp). They also compare the amount of [[Leverage|leverage]] other businesses in the same industry are using—on the assumption that these companies are operating with an [[Optimal Capital Structure|optimal capital structure]]—to see if the company is employing an unusual amount of [[Debt|debt]] within its capital structure.

Another way to determine optimal [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] levels is to think like a bank. What is the optimal level of debt a bank is willing to lend? An analyst may also utilize other debt ratios to put the company into a credit profile using a bond [[Rating|rating]]. The [[Default|default]] spread attached to the bond rating can then be used for the spread above the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of a AAA-rated company.

## Limitations of [[Optimal Capital Structure]]

Unfortunately, there is no magic ratio of [[Debt|debt]] to [[Equity|equity]] to use as guidance to achieve real-world [[Optimal Capital Structure|optimal capital structure]]. What defines a healthy blend of debt and equity varies according to the industries involved, line of business, and a firm's stage of development, and can also vary over time due to external changes in interest rates and regulatory environment.

However, because investors are better off putting their money into companies with strong balance sheets, it makes sense that the optimal balance generally should reflect lower levels of [[Debt|debt]] and higher levels of [[Equity|equity]].

## Theories on Capital Structure

### Modigliani-Miller (M&M) Theory

The Modigliani-Miller (M&M) theorem is a capital structure approach named after Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller. Modigliani and Miller were two [[Economics|economics]] professors who studied capital structure theory and collaborated to develop the capital structure irrelevance proposition in 1958.1

This proposition states that in perfect markets the capital structure a company uses doesn't matter because the market value of a firm is determined by its earning power and the [[Risk|risk]] of its [[Underlying|underlying]] assets. According to Modigliani and Miller, value is independent of the method of financing used and a company's investments. The [M&M theorem](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modigliani-millertheorem.asp) made the two following propositions:1

### Proposition I

This proposition says that the capital structure is irrelevant to the value of a firm. The value of two identical firms would remain the same and value would not be affected by the choice of financing adopted to [[Finance|finance]] the assets. The value of a firm is dependent on the expected future earnings. It is when there are no taxes.2

### Proposition II

This proposition says that the financial [[Leverage|leverage]] boosts the value of a firm and reduces WACC. It is when tax information is available. While the Modigliani-Miller theorem is studied in [[Finance|finance]], real firms do face taxes, credit [[Risk|risk]], [[Transaction Costs|transaction costs]], and inefficient markets, which makes the mix of [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] financing important.3

### Pecking Order Theory

The pecking order theory focuses on asymmetrical information costs. This approach assumes that companies prioritize their financing strategy based on the path of least resistance. Internal financing is the first preferred method, followed by [[Debt|debt]] and external [[Equity|equity]] financing as a last resort.
