[[Non-Qualified Stock Option (NSO) Definition]]
## What Is a Non-Qualified [[Stock Option]] (NSO)?

A non-qualified [[Stock Option|stock option]] (NSO) is a type of [[Define Employee Stock Option (ESO)|employee stock option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eso.asp) wherein you pay [[Ordinary Income|ordinary income]] tax on the difference between the [[Grant|grant]] price and the price at which you exercise the option.1

### Key Takeaways

-   Non-qualified [[Stock|stock]] options require payment of income tax of the [[Grant|grant]] price minus the price of the exercised option.
-   NSOs might be provided as an alternative form of compensation.
-   Prices are often similar to the market value of the [[Shares|shares]].

## Breaking Down Non-Qualified [[Stock Option]] (NSO)

NSOs are simpler and more common than [[incentive stock options (ISOs).]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iso.asp) They are called non-qualified [[Stock|stock]] options because they do not meet all of the requirements of the [[Internal Revenue Code]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internal-revenue-code.asp) to be qualified as ISOs.2

## How Non-Qualified [[Stocks]] Are Used

Non-qualified [[Stock|stock]] options give employees the right, within a designated timeframe, to buy a set number of [[Shares|shares]] of their company’s shares at a preset price. It may be offered as an alternative form of compensation to workers and also as a means to encourage their loyalty with the company.1

### Important

Non-qualified [[Stock|stock]] options often reduce the cash compensation employees earn from employment.

The price of these [[Stock|stock]] options is typically the same as the market value of the [[Shares|shares]] when the company makes such options available, also known as the [[Grant|grant]] date. Employees [[Will|will]] have a deadline to exercise these options, known as the expiration date. If the date passes without the [[options being exercised]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/putoptionexcercise.asp), the employee would lose those options.

There is an expectation that the company’s share price [[Will|will]] increase over time. That means employees stand potentially to acquire [[Stock|stock]] at a discount if the [[Grant|grant]] price—also known as the [[Exercise Price|exercise price]]—is lower than later market prices. However, the employee will pay income tax against the difference with a [[market share price]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp) of the stock when the option is exercised. Once the options are exercised, the employee can choose to sell the [[Shares|shares]] immediately or retain them.1

Non-qualified [[Stock|stock]] options (NSOs) allow employees to buy a company’s [[Shares|shares]] at a preset price.

As with other types of [[Stock|stock]] options, non-qualified stock options can be a way to reduce the cash compensation that companies pay directly to their employees while also connecting part of their compensation to the growth of the companies. The terms of the options may require employees to wait a period of time for the options to vest. Furthermore, the employee could lose the options if they left the company before the stock options are vested. There might also be [[clawback]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clawback.asp) provisions that allow the company to reclaim NSOs for a variety of reasons. This can include insolvency of the company or a buyout.

For smaller and younger businesses with limited resources, such options that can be offered in lieu of salary increases. They can also be used as a recruiting tool to make up for shortcomings in the salaries offered when hiring talent.
