[[Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)]]
## What is the [[Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)]]?

The term [[Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)]] refers to a Canadian [[stock exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/092404.asp) located in Toronto, Ontario. Founded in 1861, the TSX is Canada's premier [[Stock|stock]] exchange with more than 1,500 [[Listed|listed]] companies, including those from the energy, [[Mining|mining]], technology, and real [[Estate|estate]] [[sectors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector.asp). The exchange is also home to international listings and exchange-traded products.1 It became fully electronic after closing its trading floor in 1997.2 In 2007, the TSX merged with the [[Montreal Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montrealexchange.asp) (MX) to form the [[TMX Group]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tmx-group.asp).2

## Understanding the [[Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)]]

The Toronto [[Stock]] Exchange is one of the largest stock exchanges in the world and is the third-largest in North America after the [[New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE) and the [[Nasdaq]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/[[Nasdaq|nasdaq]].asp).34 The exchange's history dates back to the mid-1800s. It was established in 1861 and was officially incorporated in 1878 under the name Toronto Stock Exchange or TSE.2 It became known as the TSX after the company was rebranded in 2002.2

The exchange operates Monday to Friday, except for statutory holidays. The [[market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp) opens with regular [[trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/trading-4427765) activity taking place between 9:30 a.m. ET and 4:00 p.m. ET. Trading orders may be entered but not executed during the pre-open between 7:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. ET.5

As noted above, the exchange eliminated its [[trading floor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading_floor.asp) in 1997. Trades on the TSX became electronic, similar to the [[Nasdaq]] in the United States.2 Traded instruments include [[Shares|shares]] in companies, investment trusts, and [[exchange-traded products]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-products-etp.asp) (ETPs). Other financial instruments such as [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), commodities, [[Futures|futures]], options, and other [[derivative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) products are also actively traded.6 All transactions are executed in the [[Canadian dollar]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/c/cad-canadian-dollar.asp). According to the 2020 Guide to Listing, there were 1,572 [[Listed|listed]] issuers on the exchange.7

The exchange launched the TSE 300 Composite Index in 1977, which was similar to the [[S&P 500]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp).2 Composed of the most influential [[Stocks|stocks]] on the exchange, the name of the index was changed to the [[S&P/TSX Composite Index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp-tsx-composite-index.asp) in 2002. The index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis in March, June, September, and December.8

## Special Considerations

In 1999, the TSX became Canada's only exchange for senior equities. Two years later, it acquired the [[TSX Venture Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tsxventureexchange.asp), which primarily lists [[small-cap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp) [[Stocks|stocks]]. As noted above, the exchange is now operated by the TMX Group, a result of the [[merger]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger.asp) between the TSX and the MX. In addition to the TSX, the MX, and the TSX Venture Exchange, the group also operates the TSX Alpha Exchange, Shorcan, which specializes in fixed income products in Canada, and the [[Canadian Derivates Clearing Corporation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/canadian-derivatives-clearing-corporation.asp) (CDCC).910 The CDCC facilitates the clearing of Canadian exchange-traded [[Derivative|derivative]] products and other financial instruments.11

The TSX and the [[London Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lse.asp) (LSE) explored the opportunity for a merger. The deal fell through in 2011 after it failed to receive the required two-thirds majority of votes from shareholders. TMX proposed the merger to avoid a takeover by Maple Group Acquisition Corporation, a [[consortium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consortium.asp) of Canadian investors including the Canadian Plan Investment Board, Scotia Capital, and TD Securities.12 The TMX Group agreed to the Maple Group [[takeover]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/takeover.asp), which was completed in 2012.13
