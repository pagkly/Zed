[[Warrant Coverage Definition]]
## What Is [[Warrant]] Coverage?

[[Warrant]] coverage is an agreement between a company and one or more [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) where the company issues a warrant equal to some percentage of the dollar amount of an investment. Warrants, similar to options, allow investors to acquire [[Shares|shares]] at a designated price.

[[Warrant]] coverage agreements are designed to sweeten the deal for an investor because the agreement [[leverages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp) their investment and increase their [[Return|return]] if the value of the company increases as hoped.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Warrant]] coverage gives one or more shareholders the opportunity to [[Gain|gain]] additional [[Shares|shares]] as a benefit for buying ownership of the company.
-   It comes in the form of an agreement that the investor [[Will|will]] be issued warrants.
-   Warrants function much like options, except that they are issued by the company and dilute overall [[Equity|equity]] ownership.

## Understanding [[Warrant]] Coverage

[[Warrant]] coverage assures investors that they can increase their share of ownership in the company should circumstances rapidly improve. This is done by means of issuing warrants as a condition of the investors' participation.

A [[warrant]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Warrant|warrant]].asp) is a type of [[Derivative|derivative]] which gives the holder the right to buy the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] at a specified price before or at [[maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp). The warrant does not obligate the holder to purchase the underlying stock. A warrant coverage is simply the agreement to issue [[Stocks|stocks]] to cover the possible future execution of the warrant instrument.

Warrants are similar to an [[option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) but have three main exceptions. First, they originate from a company, not from traders. Second, warrants are dilutive to the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]]. When the holder exercises a [[Warrant|warrant]], the company issues new stock, rather than delivering existing stock. Finally, they can be attached to other securities, most notably [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), giving the holder the right to purchase [[Shares|shares]] of stock, as well.

While warrants come in both [[put]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) and [[call]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) varieties, for use in [[Warrant|warrant]] coverage they typically are the latter.

For example, an investor purchases 1,000,000 [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock|stock]] at a price of $5 per share, totaling a $5,000,000 investment. The company grants a 20% [[Warrant|warrant]] coverage, and issues to the investor $1,000,000 in warrants. In technical terms, the company guarantees 200,000 additional shares at an [[exercise price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp) of $5 per share.

Issuing warrants do not give the investor any additional [[downside protection]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downside-protection.asp), as the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Shares|shares]] would be issued at the same price they paid for the [[Stock|stock]]. However, the [[Warrant|warrant]] coverage would give the investor additional [[upside]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Upside|upside]].asp), if the company goes public or is sold at a price above $5 per share.

## Reasons for [[Warrant]] Coverage

[[Warrant]] coverage allows and possibly encourages the holder to participate in the success of the company, manifested in the [[appreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appreciation.asp) of the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]].

It also gives the holder protection against the [[dilutive]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp) effects of any future new share offerings. This future protection is ironic because the exercise of the [[Warrant|warrant]] is dilutive itself to the existing [[Shares|shares]].

One reason a company might issue warrants is to attract more [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp). For example, if it cannot issue bonds at a satisfactory rate or amount, warrants attached to a bond can make them more attractive to investors. Often warrants are seen as [[speculative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Speculation|speculation]].asp).

One of the best examples of [[Warrant|warrant]] coverage took place during the [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] of 2008. Wall Street giant, Goldman Sachs, needed to increase capital and raise the perception of its financial health. Goldman sold $5 billion of [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. The warrants to purchase $5 billion of [[Common Stock|common stock]] with a [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) of $115 per share had a five-year maturity. Goldman's [[Shares|shares]] were trading near $129 at that time, giving Berkshire an instant, although not guaranteed, profit.
