[[What Is a Weighted Average Coupon (WAC)]]?
## What Is the [[Weighted]] Average Coupon (WAC)?

The [[Weighted|weighted]] average coupon (WAC) is a measurement of the rate of [[Return|return]] on a pool of mortgages that is sold to investors as a mortgage-backed [[Security|security]] (MBS). The [[Underlying|underlying]] mortgages are repaid at different lengths of time, so the WAC represents its return at the time it was issued and may differ from its WAC later.

### Key Takeaways

-   The WAC is the average [[Gross Interest|gross interest]] rate of the [[Underlying|underlying]] mortgages in a mortgage-backed [[Security|security]] at the time it was issued.
-   The WAC on a mortgage-backed [[Security|security]] is used by analysts of these investments to estimate its pre-pay characteristics.
-   The WAC [[Will|will]] change over time as the mortgages [[Underlying|underlying]] the [[Security|security]] are repaid.

## Understanding a [[Weighted]] Average Coupon (WAC)

Banks routinely sell the mortgages they issue on a secondary mortgage market. The buyers are institutional investors such as [[Hedge|hedge]] funds, and investment banks. These buyers package the mortgages into [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]] that can be traded to investors on the open market as [[mortgage-backed securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp) (MBS).

In the [[Weighted|weighted]] average calculation, the [[Principal|principal]] balance of each mortgage is used as its weighting factor.

MBS holders receive interest or [[coupon payments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) which are calculated as the [[Weighted|weighted]] average of the [[Underlying|underlying]] coupon of the mortgage loans backing the MBS.

### Calculating the WAC

The [[Weighted|weighted]] average coupon (WAC) is calculated by taking the gross of the interest rates owed on the [[Underlying|underlying]] mortgages of the MBS and weighting them according to the percentage of the [[Security|security]] that each mortgage represents.

The WAC represents the average interest rate of different pools of mortgages with varying interest rates. In the [[Weighted|weighted]] average calculation, the [[Principal|principal]] balance of each [[Underlying|underlying]] mortgage is used as the weighting factor.

To calculate the WAC, the [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] of each mortgage or MBS is multiplied by its remaining [[Principal|principal]] balance. The results are added together, and the sum total is divided by the remaining balance.

Another way to calculate the [[Weighted|weighted]] average coupon is by taking the weights of each mortgage pool, multiplying by their respective coupon rates, and adding the result to get the WAC.

For example, suppose a MBS is composed of three different pools of mortgages with a [[Principal|principal]] balance of $11 million. The first mortgage bundle, or tranche, consists of $4 million worth of mortgages that [[Yield|yield]] 7.5%. The second pool has a $5 million mortgage balance at a 5% rate. The third pool has $2 million worth of mortgages with a rate of 3.8%.

Using the first method outlined above:

WAC = \[($4 million x 0.075) + ($5 million x 0.05) + ($2 million x 0.038)\] / $11 million

WAC = ($300,000 + $250,000 + $76,000) / $11 million

WAC = $626,000/$11 million = 5.69%

Alternatively, the WAC an be computed by evaluating the weight of each of the mortgage [[Tranches|tranches]] first:

Pool 1 weight: $4 million / $11 million = 36.36%

Pool 2 weight: $5 million / $11 million = 45.45%

Pool 3 weight: $2 million / $11 million = 18.18%

Sum of the weights is 100%. The WAC is, therefore, calculated as:

WAC = (36.36 x 0.075) + (45.45 x 0.05) + (18.18 x 0.038)

WAC = 2.727 + 2.2725 + 0.6908 = 5.69%

The [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] may change over the life of the MBS, as various mortgage holders pay down their mortgages at different interest rates and on different timetables.

### When an MSB Gets Risky

No mention of mortgage-backed securities is complete without a reference to the 2007-2008 [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]], which was blamed on them in large part.

Many of the MBS investments of that period were backed by mortgages issued during the nationwide housing bubble and, in many cases, issued to borrowers who could not afford to repay them. When the bubble burst, many of these borrowers were forced into [[Default|default]] and the value of the securitization of these assets melted away.

They were, in fact, collateralized with [[subprime loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/09/financial-crisis-review.asp).
