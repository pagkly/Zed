[[What Is an Options Contract]]?
## [[What Is an Options Contract]]?

An options contract is an agreement between two parties to facilitate a potential transaction on the [[underlying security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-[[Security|security]].asp) at a preset price, referred to as the [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp), prior to the expiration date.

The two types of contracts are put and call options, both of which can be purchased to speculate on the direction of [[Stocks|stocks]] or [[Stock|stock]] indices, or sold to generate income. For stock options, a single contract covers 100 [[Shares|shares]] of the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock.

### Key Takeaways

-   An options contract is an agreement between two parties to facilitate a potential transaction involving an asset at a preset price and date.
-   Call options can be purchased as a leveraged bet on the appreciation of an asset, while put options are purchased to profit from price declines.
-   Buying an option offers the right, but not the obligation to purchase or sell the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset.
-   For [[Stock|stock]] options, a single contract covers 100 [[Shares|shares]] of the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock.

## The Basics of an Options Contract

In general, call options can be purchased as a leveraged bet on the appreciation of a [[Stock|stock]] or index, while put options are purchased to profit from price declines. The buyer of a call option has the right but not the obligation to buy the number of [[Shares|shares]] covered in the contract at the strike price.

Put buyers have the right but not the obligation to sell [[Shares|shares]] at the strike price in the contract. Option sellers, on the other hand, are obligated to transact their side of the trade if a buyer decides to execute a call option to buy the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] or execute a put option to sell.

Options are generally used for hedging purposes but can be used for [[Speculation|speculation]]. That is, options generally cost a fraction of what the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Shares|shares]] would. Using options is a form of [[Leverage|leverage]], allowing an investor to make a bet on a [[Stock|stock]] without having to purchase or sell the shares outright.

## Call Option Contracts

The terms of an option contract specify the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]], the price at which that security can be transacted (strike price) and the expiration date of the contract. A standard contract covers 100 [[Shares|shares]], but the share amount may be adjusted for [[Stock|stock]] splits, special dividends or mergers.

In a call option transaction, a position is opened when a contract or contracts are purchased from the seller, also referred to as a writer. In the transaction, the seller is paid a [[Premium|premium]] to assume the obligation of selling [[Shares|shares]] at the strike price. If the seller holds the shares to be sold, the position is referred to as a covered call.

## Put Options

Buyers of put options are speculating on price declines of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] or index and own the right to sell [[Shares|shares]] at the strike price of the contract. If the share price drops below the strike price prior to expiration, the buyer can either assign shares to the seller for purchase at the strike price or sell the contract if shares are not held in the [[Portfolio|portfolio]].

## Real World Example of an Options Contract

Company ABC's [[Shares|shares]] trade at $60, and a call writer is looking to sell calls at $65 with a one-month expiration. If the share price stays below $65 and the options expire, the call writer keeps the shares and can collect another [[Premium|premium]] by writing calls again.

If the share price appreciates to a price above $65, referred to as being in-the-money, the buyer calls the [[Shares|shares]] from the seller, purchasing them at $65. The call-buyer can also sell the options if purchasing the shares is not the desired outcome.
