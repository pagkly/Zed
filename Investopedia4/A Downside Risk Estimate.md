[[A Downside Risk Estimate]]
## What Is Downside [[Risk]]?

Downside [[Risk|risk]] is an estimation of a [[Security|security]]'s potential to suffer a decline in value if the market conditions change, or the amount of loss that could be sustained as a result of the decline. Depending on the measure used, downside risk explains a worst-case scenario for an investment or indicates how much the investor stands to lose.

Downside [[Risk|risk]] measures are considered [[one-sided]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/one-tailed-test.asp) tests since they do not care about the symmetric case of [[Upside|upside]] potential, but only about potential losses.

#### Understanding [[Risk]] And Time Horizon

### Key Takeaways

-   Downside [[Risk|risk]] is a general term for the risk of a loss in particular, as opposed to the symmetrical likelihood of a loss or [[Gain|gain]].
-   Some investments have a finite amount of downside [[Risk|risk]], while some have limited downside risk.
-   Examples of downside [[Risk|risk]] calculations include semi-deviation, value-at-risk (VaR), and Roy's Safety First ratio.

## What Does Downside [[Risk]] Tell You?

Some investments have a finite amount of downside [[Risk|risk]], while others have infinite risk. The purchase of a [[Stock|stock]], for example, has a finite amount of downside risk bounded by zero; the investor can lose his entire investment. A short position in a stock, however, as accomplished through a [[short sale]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp), entails unlimited downside risk since the price of the [[Security|security]] could continue rising indefinitely.

Similarly, being a long an [[option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp)—either a call or a put—has a downside limited to the price of the option's [[Premium|premium]], while a short options position has an unlimited potential downside.

Investors, traders, and analysts use a variety of technical and fundamental [[metrics]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) to estimate the likelihood that an investment's value [[Will|will]] decline, including historical performance and [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) calculations. In general, many investments that have a greater potential for downside [[Risk|risk]] also have an increased potential for positive rewards.

Investors often compare the potential risks associated with a particular investment to its possible rewards. Downside [[Risk|risk]] is in contrast to [[Upside|upside]] potential, which is the likelihood that a [[Security|security]]'s value [[Will|will]] increase.

## Example of Downside [[Risk]]: Semi-Deviation

With investments and portfolios, a very common downside [[Risk|risk]] measure is downside deviation, which is also known as [[semi-deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/semideviation.asp). This measurement is a variation of [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] in that it measures the deviation of only bad [[Volatility|volatility]]. It measures how large the deviation in losses is. Since [[Upside|upside]] deviation is also used in the calculation of [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp), investment managers may be penalized for having large swings in profits. Downside deviation addresses this problem by only focusing on negative returns.

For example, assume the following 10 annual returns for an investment: 10%, 6%, -12%, 1%, -8%, -3%, 8%, 7%, -9%, -7%.

[[Standard Deviation|Standard deviation]] (σ), which measures the dispersion of data from its average, is calculated as follows:

σ\=∑i\=1N(xi−μ)2Nwhere:x\=Data point or observationμ\=Data set’s averageN\=Number of data points\\begin{aligned} &\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\sum\_{i=1}^{N} (x\_i - \\mu)^2 }{ N } } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &x = \\text{Data point or observation} \\\\ &\\mu = \\text{Data set's average} \\\\ &N = \\text{Number of data points} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

The formula for downside deviation uses this same formula, but instead of using the average, it uses some [[Return|return]] threshold. Often the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate is used or a hard target return. In the above example, any returns that were less than 0% were used in the downside deviation calculation.

The [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] for this data set is 7.69%. The downside deviation of this data set is 3.27%. Breaking out the bad [[Volatility|volatility]] from the good volatility shows investors a better picture. This shows that about 40% of the total volatility is coming from negative returns. This implies that 60% of the volatility is coming from positive returns. Broken out this way, it is clear that most of the volatility of this investment is "good" volatility.

## Other Measures of Downside [[Risk]]

Other downside [[Risk|risk]] measurements are employed by investors and analysts. One of these is known as [[Roy's Safety-First Criterion]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roys-safety-first-criterion.asp), or the SFRatio. This measurement allows portfolios to be evaluated based on the probability that their returns [[Will|will]] fall below this minimum desired threshold, where the optimal [[Portfolio|portfolio]] will be the one that minimizes the probability that the portfolio's [[Return|return]] will fall below a threshold level.

At an enterprise level, the most common downside [[Risk|risk]] measure is probably Value-at-Risk ([VaR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp)). VaR estimates how much a company and its [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of investments might lose with a given probability, given typical market conditions, during a set time period such as a day, week or year.

VaR is regularly employed by analysts and firms, as well as regulators in the financial industry to estimate the total amount of assets needed to cover potential losses predicted at a certain probability—say something is likely to occur 5% of the time. For a given [[Portfolio|portfolio]], time horizon, and established probability _p_, the _p_\-VaR can be described as the maximum estimated dollar amount loss during the period if we exclude worse outcomes whose probability is less than _p_.
