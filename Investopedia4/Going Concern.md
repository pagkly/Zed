[[Going Concern]]
## What Is [[Going Concern]]?

[[Going Concern|Going concern]] is an accounting term for a company that has the resources needed to continue operating indefinitely until it provides evidence to the contrary. This term also refers to a company's ability to make enough money to stay afloat or to avoid [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp). If a business is not a going concern, it means it's gone bankrupt and its assets were [liquidated](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidate|liquidate]].asp). As an example, many dot-coms are no longer going concern companies after the tech bust in the late 1990s.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Going Concern|Going concern]] is an accounting term for a company that is financially stable enough to meet its obligations and continue its business for the foreseeable future.
-   Certain expenses and assets may be deferred in financial reports if a company is assumed to be a [[Going Concern|going concern]].
-   If a company is no longer a [[Going Concern|going concern]], it must start reporting certain information on its financial statements.
-   Negative trends that lead to no longer being a [[Going Concern|going concern]] include denial of credit, continued losses, and lawsuits.

## Understanding [[Going Concern]]

Accountants use [[Going Concern|going concern]] principles to decide what types of reporting should appear on financial statements. Companies that are a going concern may defer reporting [[long-term assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermassets.asp) at current value or liquidating value, but rather at cost. A company remains a going concern when the sale of assets does not impair its ability to continue operation, such as the closure of a small branch office that reassigns the employees to other departments within the company.

Accountants who view a company as a [[Going Concern|going concern]] generally believe a firm uses its assets wisely and does not have to [[Liquidate|liquidate]] anything. Accountants may also employ going concern principles to determine how a company should proceed with any sales of assets, reduction of expenses, or shifts to other products.

[[Going Concern|Going concern]] is not included in the [[generally accepted accounting principles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) (GAAP) but is included in the [[generally accepted auditing standards]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaas.asp) (GAAS).

## Red Flags Indicating a Business Is Not a [[Going Concern]]

Certain [[red flags]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redflag.asp) may appear on financial statements of publicly traded companies that may indicate a business [[Will|will]] not be a [[Going Concern|going concern]] in the future. Listing of long-term assets normally does not appear in a company's quarterly statements or as a line item on balance sheets. Listing the value of long-term assets may indicate a company plans to sell these assets.

A firm's inability to meet its obligations without substantial restructuring or selling of assets may also indicate it is not a [[Going Concern|going concern]]. If a company acquires assets during a time of restructuring, it may plan to resell them later.

## [[Going Concern]] Conditions

[Accounting standards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-standard.asp) try to determine what a company should disclose on its financial statements if there are doubts about its ability to continue as a [[Going Concern|going concern]]. In May 2014, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fasb.asp) determined financial statements should reveal the conditions that support an entity's substantial doubt that it can continue as a going concern.1 Statements should also show management's interpretation of the conditions and management's future plans.

In general, an auditor examines a company's financial statements to see if it can continue as a [[Going Concern|going concern]] for one year following the time of an audit. Conditions that lead to substantial doubt about a going concern include negative trends in operating results, continuous losses from one period to the next, [[Loan|loan]] defaults, lawsuits against a company, and denial of credit by suppliers.
