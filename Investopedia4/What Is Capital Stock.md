[[What Is Capital Stock]]?
## [[What Is Capital Stock]]?

Capital [[Stock|stock]] is the amount of common and preferred [[Shares|shares]] that a company is authorized to issue, according to its corporate charter. Capital stock can only be issued by the company and is the maximum number of shares that can ever be outstanding. The amount is [[Listed|listed]] on the balance sheet in the company's [[shareholders' equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp) section.

### Key Takeaways

-   Capital [[Stock|stock]] is the amount of common and preferred [[Shares|shares]] that a company is authorized to issue—recorded on the balance sheet under shareholders' [[Equity|equity]].
-   The amount of capital [[Stock|stock]] is the maximum amount of [[Shares|shares]] that a company can ever have outstanding.
-   Issuing capital [[Stock|stock]] allows a company to raise money without incurring [[Debt|debt]].
-   The drawbacks of issuing capital [[Stock|stock]] are that the company relinquishes more control and dilutes the value of outstanding [[Shares|shares]].

## Understanding Capital [[Stock]]

Capital [[Stock|stock]] can be issued by a company to raise capital to grow its business. Issued [[Shares|shares]] can be bought by investors—who seek price appreciation and dividends—or exchanged for assets, such as equipment needed for operations.

The number of [[outstanding shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp), which are [[Shares|shares]] issued to investors, is not necessarily equal to the number of available or [[authorized shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedstock.asp). Authorized shares are those that a company is legally able to issue—the capital [[Stock|stock]], while outstanding shares are those that have actually been issued and remain outstanding to shareholders.

Issuing capital [[Stock|stock]] can allow a company to raise money without incurring a [[Debt|debt]] burden and the associated interest charges. The drawbacks are that the company would be relinquishing more of its [[Equity|equity]] and diluting the value of each outstanding share.

The amount that a company receives from issuing capital [[Stock|stock]] is considered to be capital contributions from investors and is reported as [[paid-in capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paidincapital.asp) and [[additional paid-in capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/additionalpaidincapital.asp) in the stockholder's [[Equity|equity]] section of the balance sheet.

The [[Common Stock|common stock]] balance is calculated as the nominal or [[par value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) of the common [[Stock|stock]] multiplied by the number of common stock [[Shares|shares]] outstanding. The [[nominal value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalvalue.asp) of a company's stock is an arbitrary value assigned for balance sheet purposes when the company is issuing shares—and is generally $1 or less. It has no relation to the market price.

## Example of Capital [[Stock]]

If a company obtains authorization to raise $5 million and its [[Stock|stock]] has a par value of $1, it may issue and sell up to 5 million [[Shares|shares]] of stock. The difference between the par value and the sale price of the stock is logged under shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] as [[additional paid-in capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/additionalpaidincapital.asp).

If the [[Stock|stock]] sells for $10, $5 million [[Will|will]] be recorded as paid-in capital, while $45 million will be treated as additional paid-in capital.

Consider, Apple (AAPL), which has authorized 12.6 million [[Shares|shares]] with a $0.00001 par value. The 12.6 million is its capital [[Stock|stock]]. Meanwhile, as of June 27, 2020, Apple had issued 4,283,939 shares and had 4,443,236 outstanding.

## Special Considerations

Firms can issue some of the capital [[Stock|stock]] over time or buy back [[Shares|shares]] that are currently owned by shareholders. Previously outstanding shares that are bought back by the company are known as [[Treasury shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurystock.asp).

Authorized [[Stock|stock]] refers to the maximum number of [[Shares|shares]] a firm is allowed to issue based on the board of directors' approval. Those shares can be either common or [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] shares. A business can issue shares over time, so long as the total number of shares does not exceed the authorized amount. Authorizing a number of shares is an exercise that incurs legal cost, and authorizing a large number of shares that can be issued over time is a way to optimize this cost.

[Preferred stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) is [[Listed|listed]] first in the shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] section of the balance sheet, because its owners receive dividends before the owners of [[Common Stock|common stock]], and have preference during liquidation. Its par value is different from the common [[Stock|stock]], and sometimes represents the initial selling price per share, which is used to calculate its dividend payments.

Total par value equals the number of [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] [[Shares|shares]] outstanding times the par value per share. For example, if a company has 1 million shares of preferred [[Stock|stock]] at $25 par value per share, it reports a par value of $25 million.
