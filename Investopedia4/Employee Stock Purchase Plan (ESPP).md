[[Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)]]
## What Is an Employee [[Stock]] Purchase Plan?

An [[Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)|employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)]] is a company-run program in which participating employees can purchase company [[Stock|stock]] at a discounted price. Employees contribute to the plan through [[payroll]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Payroll|payroll]].asp) deductions which build up between the [[Offering|offering]] date and the purchase date. At the purchase date, the company uses the employee's [[accumulated funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulated-fund.asp) to purchase stock in the company on behalf of the participating employees.

### Key Takeaways

-   _An ESPP is a program in which employees can purchase company [[Stock|stock]] at a discounted price._
-   _Employees contribute through [[Payroll|payroll]] deductions, which build until the purchase date._
-   _The discount can be as much as 15% in some cases._

## Understanding Employee [[Stock]] Purchase Plans (ESPP)

With employee [[Stock|stock]] purchase plans, the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] on company [[Shares|shares]] depends on the specific plan but can be as much as 15% lower than the [[market price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp). ESPPs may have a “look back” provision allowing the plan to use a historical closing price of the stock. This price may be either the price of the stock [[Offering|offering]] date or the purchase date – often whichever figure is lower.

### Qualified Vs. Non-qualified Plans

ESPPs are categorized in two ways: qualified and non-qualified. Qualified plans require the approval of shareholders before implementation, and all plan participants have equal rights in the plan. The [[Offering|offering]] period of a qualified ESPP cannot be greater than three years and there are restrictions on the maximum price discount allowable. Non-qualified plans are not subject to as many restrictions as a qualified plan. However, non-qualified plans do not have the tax advantages of after-tax deductions that qualified plans do.

### Important Dates

Participation in the company ESPP may only commence after the [[Offering|offering]] period has begun. This period begins on the offering date, and this date corresponds with the [[Grant|grant]] date for the [[Stock Option|stock option]] plans. The purchase date [[Will|will]] mark the end of the [[Payroll|payroll]] deduction period. Some offering periods have multiple purchase dates in which [[Stock|stock]] may be purchased.

### Eligibility

ESPPs typically do not allow individuals who own more than 5% of company [[Stock|stock]] to participate. Restrictions are often in place to disallow employees who have not been employed with the company for a specified duration – often one year. All other employees typically have the option, but not the obligation, to participate in the plan.

### Key Figures

During the application period, employees state the amount to be deducted from their pay and contributed to the plan. This may be subject to a percentage limitation. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) restricts the total dollar amount to be contributed to $25,000 per calendar year. Most ESPPs [[Grant|grant]] employees a price discount of up to 15%.

### Dispositions

The [[Taxation|taxation]] rules regarding ESPPs are complex. In general, qualifying dispositions are taxed during the year of the sale of [[Stock|stock]]. Any discount offered to the original stock price is taxed as [[Ordinary Income|ordinary income]], while the remaining [[Gain|gain]] is taxed as a long-term capital gain. Unqualified dispositions can result in the entire gain being taxed at ordinary income tax rates.
