[[Rights Offering (Issue) Definition]]
## What Is a Rights [[Offering]] (Issue)?

A rights [[Offering|offering]] (rights issue) is a group of rights offered to existing shareholders to purchase additional [[Stock|stock]] [[Shares|shares]], known as subscription [[warrants]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Warrant|warrant]].asp), in proportion to their existing [[Holdings|holdings]]. These are considered to be a type of option since it gives a company's stockholders the right, but not the obligation, to purchase additional shares in the company.

In a rights [[Offering|offering]], the subscription price at which each share may be purchased is generally discounted relative to the current market price. Rights are often transferable, allowing the holder to sell them in the open market.

## How a Rights [[Offering]] (Issue) Works

In a rights [[Offering|offering]], each shareholder receives the right to purchase a pro-rata allocation of additional [[Shares|shares]] at a specific price and within a specific period (usually 16 to 30 days). [[Shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp), notably, are not obligated to exercise this right. 

A rights [[Offering|offering]] is effectively an invitation to existing shareholders to purchase additional new [shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Shares|shares]].asp) in the company. More specifically, this type of issue gives existing shareholders [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) called "rights," which, well, give the shareholders the right to purchase new shares at a discount to the [market price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) on a stated future date. The company is giving shareholders a chance to increase their [exposure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketexposure.asp) to the [stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp) at a discount price. (For more, watch the [_Stock Rights Issue_](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/stock-rights-issue/) video.)

But until the date at which the new [[Shares|shares]] can be purchased, shareholders may trade the rights on the market the same way that they would trade [ordinary shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryshares.asp). The rights issued to a shareholder have value, thus compensating current shareholders for the future [dilution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp) of their existing shares' value. Dilution occurs because a rights [[Offering|offering]] spreads a company’s net profit over a wider number of shares. Thus, the company’s earnings per share, or EPS, decreases as the allocated earnings result in share dilution.

### Key Takeaways

-   A rights issue is an invitation to existing shareholders to purchase additional new [[Shares|shares]] in the company.
-   In a rights [[Offering|offering]], each shareholder receives the right to purchase a pro-rata allocation of additional [[Shares|shares]] at a specific price and within a specific period (usually 16 to 30 days).
-   Shareholders are not obligated to exercise this right. 
-   Cash-strapped companies can turn to rights issues to raise money when they really need it.

## Types of Rights Offerings

There are two general types of rights offerings: direct rights offerings and insured/standby rights offerings. 

-   In direct rights offerings, there are no [[standby/backstop purchasers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backstop_purchaser.asp) (purchasers willing to purchase unexercised rights) as the issuer only sells the number of exercised [[Shares|shares]]. If not subscribed properly, the issuer may be undercapitalized. 
-   Insured/standby rights offerings, usually the more expensive type, allow third-parties/backstop purchasers (e.g. investment banks) to purchase unexercised rights. The backstop purchasers agree to the purchase prior to the rights [[Offering|offering]]. This type of agreement ensures the issuing company that their capital requirements [[Will|will]] be met. 

In some cases, rights issued are not transferable. These are known as "[non-renounceable rights](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonrenounceablerights.asp)." In other cases, the beneficiary of a rights issue may sell them to another party.

## Rights [[Offering]] Advantages

Companies generally [[Offer|offer]] rights when they need to raise money. Examples include when there is a need to pay off [[Debt|debt]], purchase equipment, or acquire another company. In some cases, a company may use a rights [[Offering|offering]] to raise money when there are no other viable financing alternatives. Other significant benefits of a rights offering are that the issuing company can bypass [[underwriting fees]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting-fees.asp), there is no shareholder approval needed, and market interest in the issuer's [[Common Stock|common stock]] generally peaks. For existing shareholders, rights offerings present the opportunity to purchase additional [[Shares|shares]] at a discount.

## Rights [[Offering]] Disadvantages

Sometimes, rights offerings present disadvantages to the issuing company and existing shareholders. Shareholders may disapprove because of their concern with [[dilution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp). The [[Offering|offering]] may result in more concentrated investor positions. The issuing company, in an attempt to raise capital, may find that additional required filings and procedures associated with the rights offering are too costly and time-consuming; the costs of the rights offering may outweigh the benefits [(cost-benefit principle)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-benefitanalysis.asp).
