[[Marginal Revenue (MR) Definition]]
## What Is Marginal Revenue?

Marginal revenue (MR) is the increase in revenue that results from the sale of one additional unit of output. While marginal revenue can remain constant over a certain level of output, it follows from the [[law of diminishing returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingmarginalreturn.asp) and [[Will|will]] eventually slow down as the output level increases. In economic theory, [[perfectly competitive]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfectcompetition.asp) firms continue producing output until marginal revenue equals [[marginal cost]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalcostofproduction.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   Marginal revenue refers to the incremental change in earnings resulting from the sale of one additional unit.
-   Analyzing marginal revenue helps a company identify the revenue generated from one additional unit of production.
-   A company that is looking to maximize its profits [[Will|will]] produce up to the point where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.
-   When marginal revenue falls below marginal cost, firms typically do a cost-benefit analysis and halt production

## Understanding Marginal Revenue

A company calculates marginal revenue by dividing the change in [[total revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-revenue.asp) by the change in total output quantity. Therefore, the sale price of a single additional item sold equals marginal revenue. For example, a company sells its first 100 items for a total of $1,000. If it sells the next item for $8, the marginal revenue of the 101st item is $8. Marginal revenue disregards the previous average price of $10, as it only analyzes the incremental change.

Any benefits gained from adding the additional unit of activity are marginal benefits. One such benefit occurs when marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, resulting in a profit from new items sold. A company experiences the best results when production and sales continue until [[marginal revenue equals marginal cost]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/how-marginal-revenue-related-marginal-cost-production.asp). Beyond that point, the cost of producing an additional unit [[Will|will]] exceed the revenue generated. When marginal revenue falls below marginal cost, firms typically adopt the [[cost-benefit principle]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-benefitanalysis.asp) and halt production, as no further benefits are gathered from additional production.

The formula for marginal revenue can be expressed as:

Marginal Revenue\=Change in RevenueChange in QuantityMR\=ΔTRΔQ\\begin{aligned}\\text{Marginal Revenue}&=\\frac{\\text{Change in Revenue}}{\\text{Change in Quantity}}\\\\\\\\\[-9pt\]MR&=\\frac{\\Delta TR}{\\Delta Q}\\end{aligned}

## Example of Marginal Revenue

To assist with the calculation of marginal revenue, a revenue schedule outlines the total revenue earned, as well as the incremental revenue for each unit. The first column of a revenue schedule lists the projected quantities [[demanded]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp) in increasing order, and the second column lists the corresponding [[market price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp). The product of these two columns results in projected total revenues, in column three.

The difference between the total projected revenue of one [[Quantity Demanded|quantity demanded]] and the total projected revenue from the line below it is the marginal revenue of producing at the quantity demanded on the second line. For example, 10 units sell at $9 each, resulting in total revenues of $90; 11 units sell at $8.50, resulting in total revenues of $93.50. This indicates the marginal revenue of the 11th unit is $3.50 ($93.50 - $90).

## Competitive Firms vs. Monopolies

Marginal revenue for competitive firms is typically constant. This is because the market dictates the optimal [[Price Level|price level]] and companies do not have much—if any—discretion over the price. As a result, perfectly competitive firms maximize profits when marginal costs equal market price and marginal revenue. Marginal revenue works differently for [[monopolies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[Monopoly|monopoly]].asp). For a [[Monopolist|monopolist]], the [[Marginal Benefit|marginal benefit]] of selling an additional unit is less than the market price. 

A perfectly competitive firm can sell as many units as it wants at the market price, whereas the [[Monopolist|monopolist]] can do so only if it cuts prices for its current and subsequent units.

A firm's [[average revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arpu.asp) is its [[total revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/what-relationship-between-marginal-revenue-and-total-revenue.asp) earned divided by the total units. A competitive firm’s marginal revenue always equals its average revenue and price. This is because the price remains constant over varying levels of output. In a [[Monopoly|monopoly]], because the price changes as the quantity sold changes, marginal revenue diminishes with each additional unit and [[Will|will]] always be equal to or less than average revenue.
