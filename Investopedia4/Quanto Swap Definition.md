[[Quanto Swap Definition]]
## What Is a Quanto [[Swap]]?

A quanto [[Swap|swap]] is a cash-settled, cross-currency interest rate swap, where one of the [[counterparties]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Counterparty|counterparty]].asp) pays a foreign interest rate to the other. The notional amount is denominated in the domestic currency. [[Interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) may be fixed or floating.

Because they depend on the currency [[exchange rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp) and differences in interest rates in those currencies, they are also known as differential, rate differential, or just "diff" swaps. Another name for these swaps could also be guaranteed exchange rate [[Swap|swap]] because they naturally embed a fixed currency exchange rate in the [[swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp) contract.

## Understanding a Quanto [[Swap]]

Though they deal with two different currencies, payments are settled in just one. For example, a typical quanto [[Swap|swap]] would involve a U.S. investor paying six-month [[LIBOR]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) in U.S. dollars, for a US$1 million [[Loan|loan]], and receive in [[Return|return]], payments in U.S. dollars at the six-month [[EURIBOR]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euribor.asp) + 75 [[basis points]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp).

Fixed-for-floating quanto swaps allow an investor to minimize [[foreign exchange risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreignexchangerisk.asp). This avoidance of [[Risk|risk]] is achieved by fixing both the exchange rate and interest rate at the same time.

Floating-for-floating swaps have a slightly higher [[Risk|risk]]. In this [cross-currency swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross-currency-[[Swap|swap]].asp), exposure of each party to the spread of each country's currency interest rate happens.

## Why Use Quanto Swaps?

Investors [[Will|will]] use quanto swaps when they believe that a particular asset will do well in a country, but at the same time, fear that the country's currency will not perform as well. Thus, the investor will [[Swap|swap]] the interest rates with another investor while keeping the [[Payout|payout]] in their home currency. In this way, they can separate [[interest rate risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) from exchange rate [[Risk|risk]].

In a typical [[interest rate swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp), two agreeable counterparties exchange one stream of future interest payments for another, which has a basis of a specific [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) amount. These swaps require the exchange of a [[fixed interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp) value for a floating rate value. The [[Swap|swap]] may be either direction but is built to reduce or to increase exposure to the changes in interest rates. An interest rate swap may also help obtain a marginally lower interest rate than would have been possible without the swap.

However, for an investor in a different country wishing to engage in a [[Swap|swap]] in the U.S. market, they first would have to exchange their asset from their home currency into U.S. dollars. Each payment is made in U.S. dollars, which the foreign investor must then transfer back into their home [[currency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp).

This strategy [[Will|will]] involve potential interest rate [[Risk|risk]], depending on whether the foreign investor receives [[floating rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatinginterestrate.asp) payments. It also creates a foreign exchange, or currency risk. A quanto [[Swap|swap]] solves this problem because all future exchange rates are fixed at the time of the swap contract writing.
