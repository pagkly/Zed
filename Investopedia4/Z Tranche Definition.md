[[Z Tranche Definition]]
## What Is a [[Z]] Tranche?

A [[Z]] tranche is the lowest-ranked [[tranche]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/[[Tranches|tranches]].asp) of a [collateralized mortgage obligation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmo.asp) (CMO) in terms of seniority. Its owners are not entitled to any [[coupon]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) payments, receiving no [[cash flow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) from [[underlying]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]].asp) [[mortgages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) until the more senior tranches are retired, or paid off.

Instead of paying [[interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp) to the [[Z]] tranche, the money is used to pay off the [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) of the upper [[Tranches|tranches]] faster. In turn, the principal of the Z tranche increases over this time due to the [[accrued interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruedinterest.asp). The Z tranche is also written as "Z-tranche" and referred to as the "accrual tranche." 

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Z]] tranche is a portion of a structured financial product that only receives payments once all the other [[Tranches|tranches]] have been retired.
-   Instead of paying interest to the [[Z]] tranche, the money is used to pay off the [[Principal|principal]] of the upper [[Tranches|tranches]] faster.
-   Waiting for everyone else to collect first means holders of [[Z]] [[Tranches|tranches]] are the most likely to come up empty.

## Understanding a [[Z]] Tranche

CMOs, a type of [mortgage-backed security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp) (MBS) that contains a pool of home [[loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Loan|loan]].asp) bundled together and sold as an [[investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp), are stratified so that the contrasting needs of various [investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) can be met using the same pool of [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp). 

[[Tranches]] are created to divide up different mortgage profiles into slices that have financial terms suitable for specific investors. The A tranche, for example, may [[Offer|offer]] short-term [[income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp) and a shorter time to [[maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp). The B tranche would then offer a longer time frame of steady [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]. 

At the bottom of the structure is the [[Z]] tranche. The Z tranche is mainly used to improve the attractiveness of the [[Tranches|tranches]] above it. The payments that would be going to the Z tranche instead are dedicated to speeding up the maturity of the senior tranches.

## Limitations of a [[Z]] Tranche

The [[Z]] tranche plays a critical role in the creation and long-term success of a CMO, helping to make its senior [[Tranches|tranches]] more secure. That also means that they don't tend to make very attractive investments. Z tranches are described as the riskiest tranche for a reason. It can take decades before an investor sees any money from them, so their holders are up against the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp).

[[Z]] [[Tranches|tranches]] have average life spans of 18 to 22 years, of which the accrual period is expected to last eight to 10 years, although a [[prepayment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepayment.asp) rate above expectations can significantly shorten both.

Waiting for everyone else to collect first comes with several other caveats. As we saw during the [[Great Recession]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp), homeowners can eventually [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on loans. Another big [[Risk|risk]] that increases over time is outstanding balances on mortgages being paid off ahead of schedule. This phenomenon, known as [[prepayment risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaymentrisk.asp), prevents MBS holders from recouping all the interest payments they expected to receive as part of their investment.

[[Z]] [[Tranches|tranches]] face a lot of [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) over their lifespans as [[interest rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) fluctuate and the mortgage pool goes through its [[refinancing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refinance.asp) bouts and refinancing [[burnout]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/burnout.asp).

The [[Volatility|volatility]] that the [[Z]] tranche experiences provides additional stability to the upper [[Tranches|tranches]], making it the ultimate team player within the CMO stratification.

## Benefits of a [[Z]] Tranche

Despite these flaws, there is a market for [[Z]] [[Tranches|tranches]], indicating that there are people out there who choose to invest in them. These individuals usually have [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) on hand and want to park it rather than have to reinvest regularly.

Typical [[Z]] tranche investors include those that possess long-term [[liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liability|liability]].asp) or those who worry about [reinvestment risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinvestmentrisk.asp), the possibility of being unable to reinvest cash flows at a rate comparable to their current rate of [[return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Return|return]].asp).
