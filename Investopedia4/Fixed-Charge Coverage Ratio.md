[[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio]]
## What Is the [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio]]?

The [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio|fixed-charge coverage ratio]] (FCCR) measures a firm's ability to cover its [[fixed charges]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-charge.asp), such as [[Debt|debt]] payments, interest expense, and equipment [[Lease|lease]] expense. It shows how well a company's earnings can cover its fixed expenses. Banks [[Will|will]] often look at this ratio when evaluating whether to lend money to a business.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio|fixed-charge coverage ratio]] (FCCR) shows how well a company's earnings can be used to cover its fixed charges such as rent, utilities, and [[Debt|debt]] payments.
-   Lenders often use the [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio|fixed-charge coverage ratio]] to assess a company's overall [[Creditworthiness|creditworthiness]].
-   A high FCCR ratio result indicates that a company can adequately cover fixed charges based on its current earnings alone.

#### Fixed Charge [[Coverage Ratio]]

## The Formula for the [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio]] Is:

FCCR\=EBIT+FCBTFCBT+iwhere:EBIT\=earnings before interest and taxesFCBT\=fixed charges before taxi\=interest\\begin{aligned} &FCCR = \\frac{EBIT + FCBT}{FCBT + i} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &EBIT=\\text{earnings before interest and taxes}\\\\ &FCBT=\\text{fixed charges before tax}\\\\ &i=\\text{interest}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

## How to Calculate the [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio]]

The calculation for determining a company's ability to cover its fixed charges starts with [[earnings before interest and taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT) from the company's income statement and then adds back interest expense, [[Lease|lease]] expense, and other fixed charges.

Next, the adjusted EBIT is divided by the amount off fixed charges plus interest. A ratio result of 1.5, for example, shows that a company can pay its fixed charges and interest 1.5 times out of earnings.

## What Does the [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio]] Tell You?

The fixed-charge ratio is used by lenders looking to analyze the amount of [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] a company has available for [[Debt|debt]] repayment. A low ratio often reveals a drop in earnings and could be dire for the company, which is a situation that lenders try to avoid.

As a result, many lenders use coverage ratios, including the [[times-interest-earned ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tie.asp) (TIE) and the fixed-charge coverage ratio, to determine a company's ability to take on and pay for additional [[Debt|debt]]. A company that can cover its fixed charges at a faster rate than its peers is not only more efficient but more profitable. This is a company that wants to borrow to [[Finance|finance]] growth rather than to get through a hardship.

A company's sales and the costs related to its sales and operations make up the information shown on its [[income statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp). Some costs are variable costs and dependent on the volume of sales over a particular time period. As sales increase, so do the variable costs. Other costs are fixed and must be paid regardless of whether or not the business has activity. These fixed costs can include items such as equipment [[Lease|lease]] payments, insurance payments, installment payments on existing [[Debt|debt]], and preferred dividend payments.

## Example of the Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio in Use

The goal of computing the [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio|fixed-charge coverage ratio]] is to see how well earnings can cover fixed charges. This ratio is a lot like the TIE ratio, but it is a more conservative measure, taking additional fixed charges, including [[Lease|lease]] expenses, into consideration.

The [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio|fixed-charge coverage ratio]] is slightly different from the TIE, though the same interpretation can be applied. The fixed-charge [[Coverage Ratio|coverage ratio]] adds [[Lease|lease]] payments to earnings before income & taxes (i.e., [[EBIT]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp)) and then divides by the total interest and lease expenses.

For example, say Company A records EBIT of $300,000, [[Lease|lease]] payments of $200,000, and $50,000 in interest expense. The calculation is $300,000 plus $200,000 divided by $50,000 plus $200,000, which is $500,000 divided by $250,000, or a [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio|fixed-charge coverage ratio]] of 2x. The company's earnings are two times greater than its fixed costs, which is low.

Like the TIE, the higher the FCCR ratio, the better.

## Limitations of the Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio

The FCCR doesn't consider rapid changes in the amount of capital for new and growing companies. The formula also doesn't consider the effects of funds taken out of earnings to pay an owner's draw or pay dividends to investors. These events affect the ratio inputs and can give a misleading conclusion unless other metrics are also considered.

For this reason, when banks evaluate a company's [[creditworthiness]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp) for a [[Loan|loan]], they typically look at several other benchmarks in addition to the [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio|fixed-charge coverage ratio]] in order to [[Gain|gain]] a more complete view of the company's financial condition.
