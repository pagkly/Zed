[[One-Cancels-the-Other Order - (OCO) Definition]]
## What is a One-Cancels-the-Other Order (OCO)

A one-cancels-the-other order (OCO) is a pair of [[conditional orders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conditionalorder.asp) stipulating that if one order executes, then the other order is automatically canceled. An OCO order often combines a [[stop order]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stoporder.asp) with a [[limit order]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) on an automated trading platform. When either the stop or limit price is reached and the order executed, the other order automatically gets canceled. Experienced traders use OCO orders to mitigate [[Risk|risk]] and to enter the market.

OCO orders may be contrasted with order-sends-order (OSO) conditions that trigger, rather than cancel, a second order.

### Key Takeaways

-   One-cancels-the-other (OCO) is a type of conditional order for a pair of orders in which the execution of one automatically cancels the other.
-   OCO orders are generally used by traders for volatile [[Stocks|stocks]] that trade in a wide price range.
-   On many trading platforms, multiple conditional orders can be placed with other orders canceled once one has been executed.Â 

## Basics of a One-Cancels-the-Other Order

Traders can use OCO orders to trade [[retracements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Retracement|retracement]].asp) and breakouts. If a trader wanted to trade a break above resistance or below support, they could place an OCO order that uses a buy stop and sell stop to enter the market.

For example, if a [[Stock|stock]] is trading in a range between $20 and $22, a trader could place an OCO order with a buy stop just above $22 and a sell stop just below $20. Once the price breaks above [[resistance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp) or below support, a trade is executed and the corresponding [[Stop Order|stop order]] is canceled. Conversely, if a trader wanted to use a [[Retracement|retracement]] strategy that buys at [[support]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp) and sells at resistance, they could place an OCO order with a buy limit order at $20 and a sell limit order at $22.

If OCO orders are used to enter the market, the trader needs to manually place a stop loss order once the trade gets executed. The [[Time In Force]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timeinforce.asp) for OCO orders should be identical, meaning that the timeframe specified for execution of both stop and limit orders should be the same.

## Example of an OCO order

Suppose an investor owns 1,000 [[Shares|shares]] of a volatile [[Stock|stock]] that is trading at $10. The investor expects this stock to trade in a wide range in the near term, and has a target of $13; for [[Risk|risk]] mitigation, they do not not want to lose more than $2 per share. The investor could, therefore, place an OCO order, which would consist of a stop-loss order to sell 1,000 shares at $8, and a simultaneous limit order to sell 1,000 shares at $13, whichever occurs first. These orders could either be [[day orders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dayorder.asp) or [[good-till-canceled orders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gtc.asp).

If the [[Stock|stock]] trades up to $13, the limit order to sell executes, and the investor's holding of 1,000 [[Shares|shares]] gets sold at $13. Concurrently, the $8 stop-loss order gets automatically canceled by the trading platform. If the investor places these orders independently, there is a [[Risk|risk]] that they might forget to cancel the stop-loss order, which could result in an unwanted [[short position]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) of 1,000 shares if the stock subsequently trades down to $8.
