[[Home Mortgage]]
## What Is a [[Home Mortgage]]?

A [[Home Mortgage|home mortgage]] is a [[Loan|loan]] given by a bank, [[mortgage company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage-company.asp) or other financial institution for the purchase of a residence—either a primary residence, a secondary residence, or an investment residence—in contrast to a piece of commercial or industrial property. In a home mortgage, the owner of the property (the borrower) transfers the title to the [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) on the condition that the title [[Will|will]] be transferred back to the owner once the final loan payment has been made and other terms of the mortgage have been met.

#### Should You Buy a Home With Cash Or a Mortgage?

A home [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) is one of the most common forms of [[Debt|debt]], and it is also one of the most recommended. Because they are secured debt—there is an asset (the residence) acts as backing for the [[Loan|loan]]—mortgages come with lower interest rates than almost any other kind of loan an individual consumer can find.

### key takeaways

-   A [[Home Mortgage|home mortgage]] is a [[Loan|loan]] given by a bank, mortgage company or other financial institution for the purchase of a residence.
-   A [[Home Mortgage|home mortgage]] [[Will|will]] have either a fixed or floating interest rate, and a lifespan of anywhere from three to 30 years.
-   The [[Lender|lender]] who extends the [[Home Mortgage|home mortgage]] retains the title to the property, which it gives to the borrower when the mortgage is paid off.

## How a [[Home Mortgage]] Works

Home mortgages allow a much broader group of citizens the chance to own [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp), as the entire [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of the house doesn't have to be provided up front. But because the [[Lender|lender]] actually holds the title for as long as the mortgage is in effect, it has the right to foreclose one the home (seize it from the homeowner, and sell it on the open market) if the borrower can't make the payments.

A [[Home Mortgage|home mortgage]] [[Will|will]] have either a fixed or floating interest rate, which is paid monthly along with a contribution to the [[Principal|principal]] [[Loan|loan]] amount. In a [[fixed-rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-rate_mortgage.asp) mortgage, the interest rate and the periodic payment are generally the same each period. In an [[adjustable rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp) home  
mortgage, the interest rate and periodic payment vary. Interest rates on adjustable-rate home mortgages are generally lower than fixed-rate home mortgages because the borrower bears the [[Risk|risk]] of an increase in interest rates.

Either way, the mortgage works the same way: As the homeowner pays down the [[Principal|principal]] over time, the interest is calculated on a smaller base so that future mortgage payments apply more towards [[principal reduction]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-reduction.asp) as opposed to just paying the interest charges.

In a mortgage transaction, the [[Lender|lender]] is known as the mortgagee and the borrower is known as the mortgagor.

## Getting a [[Home Mortgage]]

To obtain a mortgage, the person seeking the [[Loan|loan]] must submit an application and information about his or her financial history to a [[Lender|lender]], which is done to demonstrate that the borrower is capable of [[repaying the loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-calculator-5084794). Sometimes, borrowers look to a [[mortgage broker]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgagebroker.asp) for help in choosing a lender. 

The process has several steps. First, borrowers might seek to be pre-qualified. Getting pre-qualified involves supplying a bank or [[Lender|lender]] with your overall financial picture, including your [[Debt|debt]], income, and assets. The lender reviews everything and gives you an estimate of how much you can expect to borrow. [[Pre-qualification]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/prequalified-approved.asp) can be done over the phone or online, and there’s usually no cost involved.

Getting preapproved is the next step. You must complete an official mortgage application to be preapproved, and you must [[Supply|supply]] the [[Lender|lender]] with all the necessary documentation to perform an extensive check on your financial background and current credit [[Rating|rating]].You’ll receive a conditional commitment in writing for an exact [[Loan|loan]] amount, allowing you to look for a home at or below that [[Price Level|price level]].

After you've found a residence you want, the final step in the process is a [[loan commitment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Loan|loan]]-commitment.asp), which is only issued by a bank when it has approved you as the borrower, as well as the home in question—meaning that the property is appraised at or above the sales price.

When the borrower and the [[Lender|lender]] have agreed on the terms of the [[Home Mortgage|home mortgage]], the lender puts a [lien](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp) on the home as [[Collateral|collateral]] for the [[Loan|loan]]. This lien gives the lender the right to take possession of the house if the borrower defaults on the repayments.
