[[Taxable Wage Base]]
## What Does [[Taxable Wage Base]] Mean?

The [[Taxable Wage Base|taxable wage base]] is the maximum amount of [[earned income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnedincomecredit.asp) that employees must pay [[Social Security]] taxes on. Generally, the employee's gross wages [[Will|will]] be equal to the taxable wage base. Typically, an employer will handle this calculation and withhold the correct amount of taxes from each of the employee's paychecks; however, the employee is still responsible for reporting the tax.

The [[Taxable Wage Base|taxable wage base]] is also known as the [[Social Security]] wage base.

## [[Taxable Wage Base]] Explained

[Social [[Security]] tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-tax.asp) is not applied on wages, salaries, and bonuses in excess of the stipulated maximum amount of wages that are subject to [[Social Security]] taxes. As of 2018, the Social Security tax rate is 12.4%. Half of the tax is paid by the employer, and the employee is responsible for paying the other half, which is 6.2%. For earnings in 2020, the maximum amount of income that taxpayers must pay Social Security tax on is $137,700. In other words, the [[Taxable Wage Base|taxable wage base]] is $137,700.1

Consider an employee, Rob, who earns $85,000 in [[gross income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp) and has a 6.2% [[Social Security]] tax withheld from his pay. The federal government, in effect, [[Will|will]] collect 6.2% x $85,000 = $5,270 from Rob to help fund [[retirement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement-planning.asp) and disability benefits for retirees. In some instances, an employee will earn wages that can be classified as excess wage. The excess wage can be subtracted from [[Gross Income|gross income]] so that the [[Taxable Wage Base|taxable wage base]] is lower than gross income. For example, assume another employee, Sue, earns $175,000 gross income. The Social [[Security]] tax rate will only be applied up to the taxable wage base of $137,700, which is less than her gross income. Therefore, Sue will pay 6.2% x $137,700 = $8,537.40 as her contribution to the countryâ€™s Social Security account for retirees and the disabled.

[[Taxable Wage Base|Taxable wage base]] is most often used in reference to [[Social Security]] taxes, though it can apply to any income-based tax. For example, some state [[Unemployment|unemployment]] agencies use a taxable wage base to calculate [[unemployment taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-insurance.asp). In California, the taxable wage base as of 2020 is $7,000, Ohio - $9,000, Pennsylvania - $10,000, New York - $11,600, Connecticut - $15,000, Oklahoma - $18,700, Wyoming - $26,400, Nevada - $32,500, Hawaii - $48,100, etc. Refer to the American [[Payroll]] Association website for the [[Unemployment Insurance|unemployment insurance]] taxable wage base for all states.2

The [[Taxable Wage Base|taxable wage base]] for [[Social Security]] and [[Unemployment]] taxes increases every year or every few years. Note that although Social [[Security]] tax is applied up to the taxable wage base, [[Medicare tax]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp) is applied on 100% of income.1
