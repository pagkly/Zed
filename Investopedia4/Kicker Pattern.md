[[Kicker Pattern]]
## What Is a [[Kicker Pattern]]?

A [[Kicker Pattern|kicker pattern]] is a two-bar [[candlestick]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp) pattern that predicts a change in the direction of an asset's price trend. This pattern is characterized by a sharp [[Reversal|reversal]] in price over the span of two candlesticks. Traders use it to determine which group of market participants is in control of the direction.

The pattern points to a strong change in investors' attitudes toward a [[security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp). The change in direction usually occurs following the release of valuable information about a company, industry, or economy.

## Understanding the [[Kicker Pattern]]

The [[Stock|stock]] market is characterized by competing buyers (bulls) and sellers (bears). The constant tug of war among these players is what forms [[candlesticks patterns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp). Candlestick charting originated from a technique developed in Japan in the 1700s that tracked the price of rice. Candlesticks are a suitable technique for trading any liquid financial asset such as [[Stocks|stocks]], [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Futures|futures]].asp), and [[foreign exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp).

The [[Kicker Pattern|kicker pattern]] is considered one of the most reliable [[Reversal|reversal]] patterns and usually indicates a dramatic change in a company's [[fundamentals]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Fundamentals|fundamentals]].asp). The [[Kicker|kicker]] pattern is a reversal pattern, and it differs from a gap pattern, which tends to show a gap up or down and stay in that trend. The patterns look similar, but each implies something different.

[[Kicker]] patterns are either [[bullish]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp) or [[bearish]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear.asp). Bullish kickers start with a bearish candle and then show a bullish gap up. Bearish kickers start with a bullish candle and then show a bearish gap down.

## How the [[Kicker Pattern]] Works

To traders observing the [[Kicker Pattern|kicker pattern]], it may seem like the price has moved too quickly, and they may wait for a [[Pullback|pullback]]. However, those traders may find themselves wishing they had entered a position when they originally identified the [[Kicker|kicker]] pattern.

While the [[Kicker Pattern|kicker pattern]] is one of the strongest bull or bear sentiment indicators, the pattern is rare. Most professional traders do not rapidly overreact in one direction or another. However, if and when the [[Kicker|kicker]] pattern presents itself, money managers are quick to take notice.

The [[Kicker Pattern|kicker pattern]] is one of the most powerful signals available to [[technical analysts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp). Its relevance is magnified when it occurs in [[Overbought|overbought]] or oversold markets. The two candles behind the pattern take on visible significance. The first candle opens and moves in the direction of a current trend and the second candle opens at the same open of the previous day (a gap open) and then heads in the opposite direction of the prior day’s candle.

The bodies of the candles are opposite colors on many trading platforms, creating a colorful display of the dramatic change in investor sentiment. Because the [[Kicker Pattern|kicker pattern]] occurs only after a significant change in the investor attitude; the indicator is often studied with other measures of market psychology or behavioral [[Finance|finance]].

## Example of a Bearish [[Kicker]] Candlestick Pattern

The Bearish [[Kicker]] Candlestick Chart pattern's reliability is high when it is formed at the uptrend or formed in an [[Overbought|overbought]] area.

On day 1**,** one candlestick continues an uptrend and is, therefore, bullish in nature. It has no significance on its own when formed in an uptrend.

On day 2, a bearish candlestick emerges. The candlestick opens at the same price as the previous day (or a gap down) and then heads in the opposite direction of the Day 1 candle. For this pattern to be valid, the open price of the day 2 candlestick must be the same as the open price of the day 1 candlestick. However, a gap down [[Will|will]] further strengthen the pattern.
