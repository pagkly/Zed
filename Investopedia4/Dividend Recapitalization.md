[[Dividend Recapitalization]]
## What Is [[Dividend Recapitalization]]?

A [[Dividend Recapitalization|dividend recapitalization]] (also known as a _dividend recap)_ happens when a company takes on new [[Debt|debt]] in order to pay a [[special dividend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specialdividend.asp) to private investors or shareholders. This usually involves a company owned by a private investment firm, which can authorize a dividend recapitalization as an alternative to the company declaring regular dividends, based on earnings.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Dividend Recapitalization|Dividend recapitalization]] is when a private [[Equity|equity]] firm issues new [[Debt|debt]] so as to raise money to pay a special dividend to the investors who helped fund the initial purchase of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] company.
-   The dividend reduces the [[Risk|risk]] for the PE firm by providing early and immediate returns to shareholders but increases [[Debt|debt]] on the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] company's balance sheet.
-   A [[Dividend Recapitalization|dividend recapitalization]] is often undertaken as a way to free up money for the PE firm to give back to its investors, without necessitating an IPO, which might be risky.
-   A [[Dividend Recapitalization|dividend recapitalization]] is an infrequent occurrence, and different from a company declaring regular dividends, derived from earnings.

## Understanding [[Dividend Recapitalization]]

The dividend recap has seen explosive growth, primarily as an avenue for private [[Equity|equity]] firms to recoup some or all of the money they used to purchase their stake in a business. The practice is generally not looked upon favorably by [[creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) or [[common shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common_shareholder.asp) as it reduces the credit quality of the company while benefiting only a select few.

Prior to exiting a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] company, some [[private equity firms]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp) and [[activist investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activist-investor.asp) opt to incur additional [[Debt|debt]] on the balance sheet of the company in order to deliver early payments to their limited partners and/or managers. This reduces the [[Risk|risk]] for the firms and their shareholders.

This special dividend, in addition to not funding the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] company’s growth, weighs further on its balance sheet in the form of [[Leverage|leverage]]. Significant new [[Debt|debt]] has the potential to become a drag in adverse market conditions, following the company’s exit.

Yet [[Portfolio|portfolio]] companies selected for dividend recapitalizations have historically been generally healthy and able to withstand additional [[Debt|debt]]. This is usually due to new developments, pushed for by private [[Equity|equity]] sponsors, which produce stronger cash flows. The healthy cash flows enable private equity sponsors to get immediate partial returns on their investment since other avenues of [[Liquidity|liquidity]], such as public markets and mergers, take more time and effort.

Dividend recapitalizations reached a high during the 2006-2007 buyout boom.

## Example of a [[Dividend Recapitalization]]

In December 2017, Dover Corp. announced that it would [[spin off]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spinoff.asp) its oilfield services business, Wellsite. Wellsite would become a separate company, focused on specialized equipment – specifically, artificial lifts, which squeeze the final drops from oil wells after they’ve been fully drilled. As part of the creation of this distinct entity, parent company Dover planned a [[Dividend Recapitalization|dividend recapitalization]] of ~$700 million, leaving Wellsite with long-term [[Debt|debt]] of 3.4 X [[EBITDA]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp). While regular dividends go to the preferred and common shareholders, in this example, the dividend funded a $1 billion buyback on Dover’s behalf, supported by activist investor Third Point, LLC.
