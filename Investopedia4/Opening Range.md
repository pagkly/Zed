[[Opening Range]]
## What Is the [[Opening Range]]?

The [[Opening Range|opening range]] shows a [[Security|security]]'s high and low price of a given period after the market opens. Day traders monitor a [[Stock|stock]]'s opening range because it can provide an indication of [[sentiment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsentiment.asp) and price trend for the day.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Opening Range|opening range]] shows a [[Security|security]]'s high and low price of a given period after the market opens.
-   Opening ranges are important to traders because they can provide an indication of sentiment and price trend for the day.
-   Traders often monitor opening ranges before or after periods of heightened [[Volatility|volatility]].

## Understanding the [[Opening Range]]

The [[Opening Range|opening range]] is one of several price ranges that [[technical analysts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analyst.asp) follow when watching a chart. Trading ranges, in general, can be a powerful indicator for technical analysts. The opening range often shows strength, weakness, or a [[sideways trend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sidewaystrend.asp) with no clear sentiment. Most charts display the day's high and low, which shows the exact trading range from open through the current time period.

Many investors follow the [[Opening Range|opening range]] of a [[security's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) price before or after a significant announcement, such as when a company releases its [[Quarterly Earnings Report|quarterly earnings report]], to gauge price direction. Investors may also choose to follow a [[Stock|stock]]'s opening range to consider its sentiment in conjunction with a potential trading idea.

## Monitoring the [[Opening Range]]

Traders can use varying patterns, other forms of [[Technical Analysis|technical analysis]], and multiple timeframes to track the [[Opening Range|opening range]]. A [[Stock|stock]]'s opening price in comparison to the previous day's closing price, for example, may help determine the day's trend. Traders can apply [[Bollinger Bands]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp) to the opening range, which shows a [[support and resistance]](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/) band drawn two standard deviations above and below a stock price's moving average. When price violates the opening range band, traders can position for either a [[breakout]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp) or [[reversion to the mean]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/meanreversion.asp). Some investors may choose to follow only a few minutes of the opening [[Price Action|price action]], while others may prefer to see an hour or more before drawing a conclusion from the opening range.

## [[Opening Range]] Trading Example

Investors and traders can monitor opening ranges using a variety of charting resources. The chart below shows the [[Opening Range|opening range]] of social networking service Twitter Inc., several days after the company released its 2019 second quarter (Q2) earnings.

The [[Opening Range|opening range]] between the dotted trendlines shows the first 25 minutes of trading activity, with the [[Stock|stock]]'s price printing a low at $41.08 and a high at $41.65. A breakout at 9:55 a.m. above the opening range and the previous day's high gives traders an indication of further [[Upside|upside]] intraday [[Momentum|momentum]], and to favor [[long positions over short positions]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-long-and-short-position-market.asp).

[Stop-loss orders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) could sit below the breakout candle or beneath the [[Opening Range|opening range]] low, depending on preferred [[Risk|risk]] tolerance. Traders may decide to take profits using a multiple of risk. For example, if using a 30-cent stop, traders might set a 60-cent profit target. Alternatively, traders may implement a [[trailing stop]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingstop.asp), such as exiting if the price closes below a moving average, to let profits run. For example, those who used this exit strategy got stopped out at 11:50 a.m. when the [[Stock|stock]]'s price closed below the 10-day [[simple moving average]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp) (SMA).
