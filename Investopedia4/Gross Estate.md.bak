[[Gross Estate]]
## What is [[Gross Estate]]

The term "[[Gross Estate|gross estate]]" refers to the total dollar value of an individual’s property and assets at the time of his or her death. This figure does not factor in any liabilities, such as debts owed and taxable events triggered by one's death. When those charges are deducted, the sum figure represents the net value of an individual’s [[Estate|estate]].

## Breaking Down [[Gross Estate]]

[[Gross Estate|Gross estate]] values are typically calculated by an executor, which defines an individual who is primarily responsible for fulfilling the directives of the deceased. Executors may only be appointed if they are specifically named on a legally-recognized [[last will and testament]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/last-[[Will|will]]-and-testament.asp). In the event that an executor is not designated, a court-appointed administrator will take over the responsibility of executing the deceased individual's [[Estate|estate]]. However, having an executor in place is a much favorable approach, because it lets people cherry-pick a person they wholeheartedly trust to oversee their estates, during their living years.

### Key Takeaways

-   "[[Gross Estate|Gross estate]]" is a term used to describe the total dollar value of an individual’s assets at the time of their death.
-   A [[Gross Estate|gross estate]] value does not consider his figure debts owed and tax liabilities. 
-   Once liabilities are deducted from a [[Gross Estate|gross estate]] value, the remaining sum represents the [[Estate|estate]]'s net value.

An [[Estate|estate]] executor's first task involves assessing and calculating the amount of assets that the deceased owned. These assets may include [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, real estate, automobiles, jewelry, antiques, artwork, and other collectibles. The resulting [[Gross Estate|gross estate]] figure is typically established for federal income tax purposes.

An executors second responsibility involves determining any liabilities, and then deducting their value from the pre-determined [[Gross Estate|gross estate]] figure, in order to compute the net [[Estate|estate]] value. Liabilities include any outstanding [[Debt|debt]], funeral expenses, taxes, and any other administrative costs that must be paid, upon one's death.

An executor's third and final task involves distributing the net [[Estate|estate]] among any beneficiaries, according to the directives articulated in the [[Will|will]].

## Benefits of [[Estate Planning]]

[Estate planning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp) can help individuals, couples, families and beneficiaries avoid complex and unforeseen tax situations during the emotional period following the death of a loved one. In addition to naming beneficiaries and determining who [[Will|will]] inherit the deceased’s assets, the [[Estate Planning|estate planning]] ritual can also greatly simplify any thorny financial matters that beneficiaries otherwise might have to contend with. Advanced [[Estate|estate]] planning tools, such as trusts, charitable giving, private foundations and others constructs, can likewise help protect an estate’s assets, while minimizing or eliminating federal estate taxes.

## Where Can [[Estate]] Executors Find Assistance?

For [[Estate|estate]] settlement advice, individuals may consult [[Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 559]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs-pub-908.asp), which provides useful guidance, and also helps individuals calculate taxes owed on an estate. This resource can also help clarify which portions of an estate beneficiaries may deduct, while also instructing individuals on how they may claim deductions and credits.
