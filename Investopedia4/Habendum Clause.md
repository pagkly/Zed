[[Habendum Clause]]
## What Is a [[Habendum Clause]]?

A [[Habendum Clause|habendum clause]] is a section of a contract that deals with [[property rights]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property_rights.asp), interests, and other aspects of ownership given to one of the parties to a deal. Consisting of basic legal language, it is usually included in property-related documents.

Most buyers and sellers have experience with it through real [[Estate|estate]] transfers, but it is also used in all manner of leases and [[deeds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deed.asp), especially in the oil and gas industry.

## Understanding a [[Habendum Clause]]

The content of a [[Habendum Clause|habendum clause]] varies depending on the exact nature of the contract. In real [[Estate|estate]] contracts, the habendum clause refers to the transfer of ownership of a property and any accompanying restrictions. Because the clause begins with the phrase, "To have and to [[Hold|hold]]," the habendum clause is sometimes called the "to have and to hold clause."

In oil and gas leases, the [[Habendum Clause|habendum clause]] defines the primary term and secondary term of the [[Lease|lease]], dictating how long the lease is in force. When used in the context of oil and gas leases, the focus of the habendum clause is on the "and so long thereafter" portion that extends the lease if conditions are met. In the oil and gas industry, the habendum clause is also referred to as the "term clause."

## Habendum Clauses in Real [[Estate]]

In real [[Estate|estate]] leases, habendum clauses are a section of the contract that describes the rights and interests given to the [[lessee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lessee|lessee]].asp).

For outright real [[Estate|estate]] purchases, a [[Habendum Clause|habendum clause]] deals with the transfer of ownership of a property and any accompanying restrictions. Usually, the habendum clause states the property is transferred without restrictions. This means the new owner has absolute ownership of the property upon satisfying their conditions (usually payment in full) and has the right to sell or bequeath the property to an [[Heir|heir]] and so on.

The type of property title transferred using a [[Habendum Clause|habendum clause]] is called "fee simple absolute." A fee simple absolute grants complete ownership of a property, subject to government laws and powers.

Because it typically begins with the phrase, "To have and to [[Hold|hold]]," the [[Habendum Clause|habendum clause]] is sometimes called the "to have and to hold clause."

Some real [[Estate|estate]] transfers [[Will|will]] include restrictions within the [[Habendum Clause|habendum clause]]. For example, a timeshare [[Lease|lease]] will outline the percentage of ownership being transferred and any other related restrictions.

Sometimes the property or the land itself is subject to a countdown, upon which ownership reverts to another entity. Some treaty lands allow development but cap the transfer of ownership at 100 years, for example. This makes any property on those lands attractive in the first half of the [[Lease|lease]], but the value is discounted as the time of ownership counts down to the deadline. Similarly, some leases can be tied to the lifespan of the [[Lessee|lessee]], with the property reverting to the original owner upon the buyer's death.

## Habendum Clauses and Oil/Gas Leases

In the oil and gas sector, the [[Habendum Clause|habendum clause]] sets out the primary term during which a company holds [[mineral rights]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mineral-rights.asp) to the land but is not obligated to start exploration. The primary term can vary from one to ten years depending on how [[proven]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proven-reserves.asp) a given field is. If the primary term passes without any production, then the [[Lease|lease]] expires. However, if the leased area is drilled and oil or gas is flowing—that is, the lease is in production—the secondary term begins and continues as long as the leased area is still producing.

In this context, the [[Habendum Clause|habendum clause]] allows the [[Lessor|lessor]] to sell the [[Lease|lease]] again if the [[Lessee|lessee]] doesn't start production within the primary term, but also protects the lessee if they invest in the land and are producing.
