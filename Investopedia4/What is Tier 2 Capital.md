[[What is Tier 2 Capital]]?
## [[What is Tier 2 Capital|What Is Tier 2 Capital]]?

The term tier 2 [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) refers to one of the components of a bank's required reserves. Tier 2 is designated as the second or supplementary layer of a bank's capital and is composed of items such as revaluation reserves, hybrid instruments, and subordinated term [[Debt|debt]]. It is considered less secure than [[Tier 1 capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier1capital.asp)—the other form of a bank's capital—because it's more difficult to [[liquidate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidate|liquidate]].asp). In the United States, the overall capital requirement is partially based on the [[Weighted|weighted]] [[Risk|risk]] of a bank's assets.

## Understanding Tier 2 Capital

Bank capital requirements were designated as part of the international [[Basel Accords]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basel_accord.asp). This set of recommendations was developed by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision over a number of years dating back to the 1980s. According to the regulations, banks must maintain a certain amount of cash and/or other forms of [[liquid assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp) on hand in order to meet their obligations. No more than 25% of a bank's capital requirements can be comprised of Tier 2 capital.1

Bank capital is divided into two layers—Tier 1 or core capital and Tier 2 or supplementary capital. A bank's capital ratio is calculated by dividing its capital by its total [[Risk|risk]]-based [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp). The minimum capital ratio [[reserve requirement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp) for a bank is set at 8%—6% of which must be provided by Tier 1 capital. The remaining must be Tier 2 capital. Along with Tier 1 capital, it provides a bank with a financial cushion in case it needs to [[Liquidate|liquidate]] its assets.2 1

There are four components of Tier 2 capital. These include:

-   **Revaluation Reserves:** These are reserves created by the revaluation of an asset. A typical revaluation reserve is a building owned by a bank. Over time, the value of the [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/real-[[Estate|estate]]-investing-guide/) asset tends to increase and can thus be revalued.3
-    **[[General Provisions]]:** This category consists of losses that a bank may have of an as yet undetermined amount including from loans. The total general provision amount allowed is 1.25% of the bank's [risk-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskweightedassets.asp) (RWA).1
-   **Hybrid Capital Instruments:** This type of capital is a mixture of both [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp) and [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) instruments. [[Preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) is an example of a hybrid instrument. A bank may include hybrid instruments in its Tier 2 capital as long as the assets are sufficiently similar to equity so losses can be taken on the face value of the instrument without triggering the [[liquidation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp) of the bank.4
-   **[Subordinated Debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subordinateddebt.asp):** [[Debt]] is subordinated in regard to ordinary bank depositors and other loans and securities that constitute higher-ranking [[senior debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seniordebt.asp). The minimum original term of this debt is five years or more.5

Tier 2 capital is split into upper and lower levels. Upper-level Tier 2 capital consists of securities that are perpetual—meaning they have no [[maturity date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp)—revaluation reserves, and fixed asset investments. Lower-level Tier 2 capital consists of subordinated [[Debt|debt]] and is generally inexpensive for a bank to issue.6

### Key Takeaways

-   Tier 2 capital is the second layer of capital that a bank must keep as part of its required reserves.
-   This tier is comprised of revaluation reserves, [[General Provisions|general provisions]], subordinated term [[Debt|debt]], and hybrid capital instruments.
-   There are two levels of Tier 2 capital—upper level and lower level capital.
-   Tier 2 capital is subordinate to Tier 1 capital and is considered riskier as it is more difficult to calculate if a bank needs to [[Liquidate|liquidate]] it.

## Special Considerations

[Undisclosed reserves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undisclosedreserves.asp) may be counted as part of a bank's Tier 2 capital in certain countries. These reserves are profits a bank earns that don't appear on publicly-available documents such as a bank's [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp). Despite not being disclosed, most banks still consider these reserves to be real assets. Regulatory authorities in some countries recognize their banks' undisclosed reserves as part of Tier 2 capital. Most countries, including the United States, do not allow this kind of capital to be used to legitimately meet [[Reserve Requirements|reserve requirements]].7 8

## Tier 2 Capital vs. Tier 1 Capital

As mentioned above, a bank's capital reserves are divided into tiers. Unlike [[Tier 2 capital, Tier 1 capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/043015/what-difference-between-tier-1-capital-and-tier-2-capital.asp) is a bank's core capital or the primary source of funding for a bank. As such, it consists of almost all of an institution's funds including all of its disclosed reserves and any [[Equity|equity]] capital like [[common stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp). This capital helps a bank absorb any losses so it can continue its day-to-day operations. Because this level is composed of a bank's core capital, Tier 1 is a very good indicator of its financial health. This tier is considered more reliable than Tier 2 capital. That's because the capital is much easier to calculate accurately. The assets that fall into this category are also much easier to [[Liquidate|liquidate]].
