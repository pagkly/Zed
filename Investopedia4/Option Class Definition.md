[[Option Class Definition]]
## What is an Option Class?

An option class is all the [[call options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) or all the put options [[Listed|listed]] on an exchange for a particular [[underlying asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-asset.asp). For example, all the calls available for trade on Apple Inc. (APPL) [[Stock|stock]] would be part of the same option class. All the puts would be part of another class. The number of options available for purchase or sale within a given option class [[Will|will]] depend on the size and trading volume of the underlying asset, as well as overall market conditions.

### Key Takeaways

-   An option class is all the puts or calls for a particular [[Underlying|underlying]] asset. Puts are one class are different classes.
-   An option class can be broken down into series, which are all the calls or puts for an [[Underlying|underlying]] asset that expire in the same month.
-   How large the option class is depends on the volume of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset and the market conditions of both the underlying and the underlying's options market.

## Understanding an Option Class

Option classes are used to categorize options on an exchange for investors. All major public market exchanges use option classes to list the option available for trade on a given [[Underlying|underlying]] asset. Quite often exchanges and financial sites [[Will|will]] break the class up into series. An [[option series]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionseries.asp) is all the call or puts for various strike prices _and the same expiry_ for a given underlying asset.

For example, all the calls or puts that expire in June would be an option series. An option series is a part of the larger option class. Therefore, when viewing options quotes, some sites may show the entire option class, but quite often it [[Will|will]] be sorted by expiry date (series).

### Options Across the Market

Other markets, such as [[over the counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) or institutional markets may not always use option classes because of the complexity and customized structuring of the [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) being traded.

Just like with [[Stocks|stocks]], exchange-traded options must be traded through a broker who connects with [[market makers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) to help facilitate trading. Option exchanges use standard [[bid-ask]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-and-ask.asp) pricing models. While option prices are generated from advanced analytics, their daily trading prices are still influenced by [[supply and demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-[[Supply|supply]]-demand.asp) in the market.

[Broker-dealers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp) generally require a minimum of $2,000 in capital for approval of an options [[Trading Account|trading account]]. Rules and regulations for options trading are overseen by the [[Options Clearing Corporation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/occ.asp).

An option chain is all the put _and_ calls options for a given [[Underlying|underlying]] asset.

Generally, once access to an options trading platform is established, investors [[Will|will]] be able to view the full listing of option classes for their preferred [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]]. Options are usually [[Listed|listed]] and classified by the ticker on the instrument’s underlying asset.

An options brokerage trading platform [[Will|will]] segregate calls and puts on [[Underlying|underlying]] securities. Calls and [[puts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp) are usually the two broadest option classes available. Within each of these classes, investors will find a list of available strike prices and expirations.

The amount of information provided on each option class [[Will|will]] typically be based on an investor’s subscription preferences. Some options quotes include advanced analytics such as [[greeks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greeks.asp), while other platforms/subscriptions may only show the basic contract name, strike, [[expiry]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp), bid, ask, last price, last trade time/date, percent change, volume, open interest, and often [[implied volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp) is included as well.

## Real World Example of an Option Class

Some option classes are large, while others are relatively small depending on how popular the options market is for a given [[Underlying|underlying]] asset.

For example, all the calls available for trade on the [[SPDR S&P 500 Trust]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/spy-spdr-sp-500-trust-etf.asp) (SPY) number in the hundreds.

On the other hand, the option class for Barnes Group Inc. ([B](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=b)) was relatively small as of June 2019, with several options available for trade with two available expiry dates. At the time, the [[Stock|stock]] was trading at $54.46.

All the calls above represent the call option class for this [[Stock|stock]], while the puts represent the put option class for this stock at the time of writing. Option classes can grow or shrink depending on whether more or fewer options become available due to increased or decreased interest.
