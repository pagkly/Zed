[[How Lease Payments Work]]
## What Are [[Lease]] Payments?

A [[Lease|lease]] payment is the equivalent of the monthly rent, that is formally dictated under a contract between two parties, granting one participant the legal right to use the other individual's real [[Estate|estate]] [[Holdings|holdings]], [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] equipment, computers, software, or other fixed assets, for a specified amount of time. A lease provides the [[lessee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lessee|lessee]].asp) with limited right-to-use without transferring ownership in [[Return|return]] for payment to the [[lessor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lessor|lessor]].asp).

The length of time in which [[Lease|lease]] payments [[Will|will]] be made can range from a month-to-month timetable, as is traditionally the case with software-as-a-service ([SaaS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/software-as-a-service-saas.asp)) business models, or it may contrarily extend through extremely long lengths of time, such as 100 years or more, which is often the case in [[land-lease]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/land_lease_option.asp) scenarios.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Lease]] payments are regular, often monthly, fees paid for the right to use a property, asset, or piece of equipment.
-   Individuals may enter into [[Lease|lease]] agreements for land, cars, computer equipment, software, or other fixed assets.
-   The terms and payment schedule for a leased item or property is often set out in a legal contract.
-   Time-tables for [[Lease|lease]] agreements may be short. as in month-to-month arrangements, or long, as is frequently the case within land-lease scenarios, which may have contracts lasting a century or more.

## Understanding [[Lease]] Payments

[[Lease]] payments can be made by individuals as well as companies. Individuals traditionally use leases to [[Finance|finance]] cars, but they may also use them to obtain the use of computer equipment, tracts of land, and other physical assets. A lease payment amount is determined by a variety of different considerations, such as an asset's value, local residual values in a given neighborhood, discount rates, and a [[Lessee|lessee]]'s [[Credit Score|credit score]].

A company's [[Lease|lease]] payments are used in the calculation of the [[Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio|fixed-charge coverage ratio]], which helps investors determine if a company is able to cover its fixed expenses, such as leases and interest. The fixed charge [[Coverage Ratio|coverage ratio]] is essentially an amplified version of the [times interest earned ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tie.asp), or the times interest coverage ratio. It's highly adaptable for practical usage, with nearly all fixed costs, since these [[fixed costs]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-difference-between-variable-cost-and-fixed-cost-[[Economics|economics]].asp) are so similar to lease payments.

## Common Types of Leases

The most common types of [[Lease|lease]] agreements are as follows:

-   [[Operating leases]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatinglease.asp)
-   Financial leases (also called [[capital leases]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitallease.asp))
-   [[Sale-and-leaseback]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaseback.asp) arrangements
-   Combination leases (those which marry two or more of the aforementioned models)

The most significant characteristic of an operating [[Lease|lease]] is that it allows for both financing and maintenance, in which lease payments include an element for financing charges as well as maintenance components. Operating leases require lessors to regularly service the leased equipment in question. For example, it is not uncommon for aircraft owners to lease out their jet engines.

In many cases, the owners don't possess the technical knowledge required to maintain the parts for themselves, because the components are highly specialized. In such cases, it behooves owners to include maintenance charges directly with [[Lease|lease]] payments.

Financial leases differ from operating leases in that they do not embed maintenance fees in the [[Lease|lease]] payments. Newer leases types, which often [[Offer|offer]] more customized service levels and lease payment structures, include [[Synthetic|synthetic]] leases, and leases tied to mileage, hours, or usage levels. For example, General Electric often leases expensive locomotive components with lease payments that are tied to mileage. In theory, a [[Lessee|lessee]] is only paying for what they need.

For consumers looking to [[Lease|lease]] an automobile (instead of purchasing one), beware of fact that some dealers impose mileage minimums in order to protect the resale value of the vehicle.
