## Who Can File Form 1099-DIV: Dividends and Distributions?

Banks, investment companies, and other financial institutions are required to provide taxpayers with a 1099-DIV by Jan. 31 each year. Companies provide a copy of the Form 1099-DIV to the investor and to the IRS.2

Most investors who receive a Form 1099-DIV will have [[ordinary dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinary-dividends.asp), qualified dividends, or total [[capital gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp).

Other categories for investors include [[unrecaptured section 1250 gain]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unrecaptured-1250-gain.asp), [[section 1202 gain]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-1202.asp), collectibles gain, non-dividend distributions, federal income tax withheld, investment expenses, foreign tax paid, foreign country or U.S. possession, cash liquidation distributions, non-cash liquidation distributions, exempt-interest dividends, specified private activity bond interest dividends, and state tax withheld.2

Investors may also be subject to [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-account-tax-compliance-act-fatca.asp) (FATCA) filing requirements for foreign accounts. This is a law that requires U.S. citizens, both in the country and abroad, to file reports on foreign account holdings.2

Foreign account holdings must be reported in U.S. dollars.

## How to File Form 1099-DIV: Dividends and Distributions

Taxpayers are required to file the information on each Form 1099-DIV they receive on their annual tax form. This can be done on a [[Schedule B]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081414/who-needs-fill-out-irs-form-schedule-b.asp) form or directly on [[Form 1040]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp). Taxpayers who receive more than $1,500 in taxable interest and/or ordinary dividends during the year are required to fill out Schedule B, which accompanies a 1040 form.2

Dividends are taxed at an investor’s income tax rate with a few exceptions. Qualified dividends are the primary exception. [[Qualified dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp) have met certain criteria that allow them to be taxed at a lower capital gains tax rate.3

The tax rate on capital gains may also vary from the ordinary income tax rate. [[Short-term capital gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short-term-gain.asp) are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, but taxes on [[long-term capital gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-term_capital_gain_loss.asp) are lower.4
