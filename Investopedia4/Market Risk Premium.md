[[Market Risk Premium]]
## What Is [[Market Risk Premium]]?

The [[Market Risk Premium|market risk premium]] is the difference between the expected [[Return|return]] on a [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]] and the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate. The market risk [[Premium|premium]] is equal to the slope of the [[security market line (SML)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sml.asp), a graphical representation of the [[capital asset pricing model (CAPM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp). CAPM measures the required rate of return on [[Equity|equity]] investments, and it is an important element of modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory and discounted [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] valuation.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Market Risk Premium|market risk premium]] is the difference between the expected [[Return|return]] on a [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]] and the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate.
-   It provides a quantitative measure of the extra [[Return|return]] demanded by market participants for the increased [[Risk|risk]].

## Understanding Market [[Risk]] Premiums

[[Market Risk Premium|Market risk premium]] describes the relationship between returns from an [[Equity|equity]] [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]] and [[treasury bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp) yields. The [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] reflects the required returns, [[Historical Returns|historical returns]], and expected returns. The historical market risk premium [[Will|will]] be the same for all investors since the value is based on what actually happened. The required and expected market premiums, however, will differ from investor to investor based on [[risk tolerance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp) and [[investing styles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstyle.asp).

## Theory

Investors require compensation for [[Risk|risk]] and opportunity cost. The [[risk-free rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp) is a theoretical interest rate that would be paid by an investment with zero risks and long-term yields on U.S. Treasuries have traditionally been used as a proxy for the [[risk-free rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/how-riskfree-rate-determined-when-calculating-market-risk-[[Premium|premium]].asp) because of the low [[Default Risk|default risk]]. Treasuries have historically had relatively low yields as a result of this assumed reliability. [[Equity Market|Equity market]] returns are based on expected returns on a broad benchmark index such as the Standard & Poor's 500 index of the [[Dow Jones industrial average]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp).

Real [[Equity|equity]] returns fluctuate with the operational performance of the [[Underlying|underlying]] business, and the market pricing for these securities reflects this fact. Historical [[Return|return]] rates have fluctuated as the economy matures and endures cycles, but conventional knowledge has generally estimated a long-term potential of approximately 8% annually. Investors demand a [[Premium|premium]] on their equity investment return relative to lower [[Risk|risk]] alternatives because their capital is more jeopardized, which leads to the equity risk premium.

## Calculation and Application

The [[Market Risk Premium|market risk premium]] can be calculated by subtracting the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate from the expected [[Equity Market|equity market]] [[Return|return]], providing a quantitative measure of the extra return demanded by market participants for the increased risk. Once calculated, the [[Equity|equity]] risk [[Premium|premium]] can be used in important calculations such as CAPM. Between 1926 and 2014, the S&P 500 exhibited a 10.5% compounding annual rate of return, while the 30-day Treasury bill compounded at 5.1%. This indicates a market risk premium of 5.4%, based on these parameters.

The required rate of [[Return|return]] for an individual asset can be calculated by multiplying the asset's beta coefficient by the market coefficient, then adding back the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate. This is often used as the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]] in discounted [[Cash Flow|cash flow]], a popular valuation model.
