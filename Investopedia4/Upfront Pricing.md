[[Upfront Pricing]]
## What Is [[Upfront Pricing]]?

[[Upfront Pricing|Upfront pricing]] refers to the interest rates and limits established for a borrower in a credit card’s underwriting and issuance.

In credit card [[underwriting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp), a [[Creditor|creditor]] [[Will|will]] use automated technology to establish all of the pricing terms at the onset of the relationship.

[[Upfront Pricing|Upfront pricing]] terms are generated from customized [[risk-based pricing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskbased-pricing.asp) methodologies that take into account a borrower’s credit profile and [[Debt|debt]]-to-income. Using these inputs the [[Creditor|creditor]] [[Will|will]] establish credit card pricing terms upfront for the credit agreement. Pricing terms generally focus on the borrower’s interest rate and credit limit.

## How [[Upfront Pricing]] Works

[[Upfront Pricing|Upfront pricing]] is a method used for credit cards that is based on [[Risk|risk]]-based pricing methodology. Risk-based pricing methodology has historically been used in the credit market for establishing all types of pricing for various [[Loan|loan]] products.

Credit card companies use a modified version of this methodology to arrive at terms generated through underwriting systems that analyze information from a credit card borrower’s credit application.

The details of a borrower’s [[Upfront Pricing|upfront pricing]] terms are included in their credit agreement.

## Credit Card Pricing

[Credit cards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp) have their own pricing systems which can vary from non-revolving [[Debt|debt]]. However, both [[Will|will]] use [[Risk|risk]]-based pricing as the primary underwriting methodology for establishing terms. Credit card pricing is typically generated immediately upon application submission with terms provided to a borrower in real-time actions.

Most credit cards [[Will|will]] have variable rates that assign a borrower a margin based on their credit profile and [[Debt|debt]]-to-income ratio. Credit card companies typically provide base rates of estimated interest for their pricing terms as a marketing tool for borrowers. Borrowers researching credit cards can find a [[Lender|lender]]’s standardized rates on a lender’s website typically found under taglines such as “pricing and terms,” “pricing information” or “rates, rewards, and other info.”

### Variable Rates and Credit Limits

A [[Lender|lender]]’s marketed rates [[Will|will]] serve as a base for the establishment of [[Upfront Pricing|upfront pricing]] terms in the underwriting process. Since most credit cards have variable rates, they will typically be based on the lender’s [[indexed rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexed_rate.asp) plus a margin.

This requires the credit card underwriting technology to generate a specific margin for each borrower. In the underwriting process, a [[Lender|lender]] [[Will|will]] also establish a credit limit. Lenders base the account’s credit limit on a borrower’s application information.

Credit limits [[Will|will]] typically vary for each borrower. For most credit cards the interest rate and credit limit are the two key [[Upfront Pricing|upfront pricing]] variables. These variables are typically established instantaneously with credit approval which also produces a credit card agreement that the borrower must sign to open the account.

## Credit Card Agreements

Credit cards usually provide an immediate decision on a new credit card account. This action requires the [[Creditor|creditor]] to rely heavily on the automated underwriting technology that processes an automated application and immediately provides a borrower with their [[Upfront Pricing|upfront pricing]] terms in a credit card agreement.

The credit card agreement also details other important factors for the borrower such as [[fees]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fee.asp). Generally, fees [[Will|will]] be constant across all accounts for a specific credit card product. Credit card fees may include late fees, monthly account maintenance fees, and annual fees.

A borrower can rely on the credit card agreement to provide all of the information about the account. The credit card agreement serves as a [[Loan|loan]] contract. It [[Will|will]] include the product’s policies for late payments, delinquencies, and defaults. It will also include all of the product’s procedures, specifically detailing how the product will charge [[interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp).
