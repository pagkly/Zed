[[Learn about Total Return]]
## What Is Total [[Return]]?

Total [[Return|return]], when measuring performance, is the actual [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) of an investment or a pool of investments over a given evaluation period. Total return includes interest, [[capital gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp), dividends, and [[distributions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution.asp) realized over a period. Total return accounts for two categories of return: income including interest paid by fixed-income investments, distributions, or dividends and [[capital appreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp), representing the change in the market price of an asset.

### Key Takeaways:

-   Total [[Return|return]] is the actual rate of return of an investment or a pool of investments over a period.
-   Total [[Return|return]] includes interest, capital gains, dividends, and realized distributions.
-   Total [[Return|return]] is expressed as a percentage of the amount invested.
-   Total [[Return|return]] is a strong measure of an investment’s overall performance.

## Understanding Total [[Return]]

Total [[Return|return]] is the amount of value an investor earns from a [[Security|security]] over a specific period, typically one year, when all distributions are reinvested. Total return is expressed as a percentage of the amount invested. For example, a total return of 20% means the security increased by 20% of its original value due to a price increase, distribution of dividends (if a [[Stock|stock]]), [[coupons]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) (if a bond), or capital gains (if a fund). Total return is a strong measure of an investment’s overall performance.

### Significance of Total [[Return]]

Some of the best dividend [[Stocks|stocks]] have low growth potential and produce small capital gains. Basing an investment’s [[return on capital gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoncapitalgains.asp) alone does not take into consideration price increases or other methods of growing the [[Stock|stock]]’s value. For example, an investor buys [[Shares|shares]] of Company B, and the share price increases 24.5% in one year. The investor gains 24.5% from the [[price change]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-change.asp) alone. Since Company B also paid a dividend during the year, adding in the stock’s [[yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/[[Yield|yield]].asp) of 4.1% to the price change, the combined [[Return|return]] is 28.6%.

Total [[Return|return]] determines an investment’s true growth over time. It is important to evaluate the big picture and not just one return metric when determining an increase in value.

Total [[Return|return]] is used when analyzing a company’s historical performance. Calculating expected future return puts reasonable expectations on an investor’s investments and helps plan for retirement or other needs.

### Average Annual Total Returns 

When analyzing [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) performance, investors should analyze their average annual total returns for different periods. Comparing returns to a [[benchmark]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) indicates how the fund has performed, relative to an index. When analyzing average annual total returns, it's important to remember:

-   The numbers almost always reflect the [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] of dividends and capital gains distributions.
-   Effects of sales charges may or may not be included. However, this information is disclosed with [[Return|return]] numbers.

## Example of Total [[Return]]

An investor buys 100 [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock]] A at $20 per share for an initial value of $2,000. Stock A pays a 5% dividend the investor reinvests, buying five additional shares. After one year, the [[share price]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/how-companys-share-price-determined.asp) rises to $22.

To calculate the investment's [[total return]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121015/[[Yield|yield]]-vs-total-[[Return|return]]-how-they-differ-and-how-use-them.asp), the investor divides the total investment gains (105 [[Shares|shares]] x $22 per share = $2,310 current value - $2,000 initial value = $310 total gains) by the initial value of the investment ($2,000) and multiplies by 100 to convert the answer to a percentage ($310 / $2,000 x 100 = 15.5%). The investor's total return is 15.5%.
