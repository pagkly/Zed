[[How to Use Required Rate of Return – RRR to Evaluate Stocks]]
## What Is Required Rate of [[Return]] – RRR?

The required [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) is the minimum [[Return|return]] an investor [[Will|will]] accept for owning a company's [[Stock|stock]], as compensation for a given level of [[Risk|risk]] associated with holding the stock. The RRR is also used in corporate [[Finance|finance]] to analyze the profitability of potential investment projects.

The required rate of [[Return|return]] is also known as the [[hurdle rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hurdlerate.asp), which like RRR, denotes the appropriate compensation needed for the level of [[Risk|risk]] present. Riskier projects usually have higher hurdle rates or RRRs than those that are less risky.

## The Formula and Calculating RRR

There are a couple of ways to calculate the required rate of [[Return|return]]. If an investor is considering buying [[Equity|equity]] [[Shares|shares]] in a company that pays dividends, the dividend-discount model is ideal. The dividend discount model is also known as the [[Gordon growth model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp).

The dividend-discount model calculates the RRR for [[Equity|equity]] of a dividend-paying [[Stock|stock]] by utilizing the current stock price, the dividend payment per share, and the forecasted dividend growth rate. The formula is as follows:

RRR\=Expected dividend paymentShare price+Forecasted dividend growth rateRRR = \\frac{\\text{Expected dividend payment} }{ \\text{Share price}} + \\text{Forecasted dividend growth rate}

### Calculating RRR Using the Dividend-Discount Model.

1.  Take the expected dividend payment and divide it by the current [[Stock|stock]] price.
2.  Add the result to the forecasted dividend growth rate.

#### How to Calculate Required Rate of [[Return]]

Another way to calculate RRR is to use the [[capital asset pricing model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp) (CAPM), which is typically used by investors for [[Stocks|stocks]] that don't pay dividends.

The CAPM model of calculating RRR uses the beta of an asset. [[Beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) is the [[Risk|risk]] coefficient of the holding. In other words, beta attempts to measure the riskiness of a [[Stock|stock]] or investment over time. [[Stocks]] with betas greater than 1 are considered riskier than the overall market (represented by the S&P 500), whereas stocks with betas less than 1 are considered less risky than the overall market.

The formula also uses the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]], which is typically the [[yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012015/how-do-i-calculate-[[Yield|yield]]-maturity-excel.asp) on short-term U.S. Treasury securities. The final variable is the market rate of return, which is typically the annual return of the [[S&P 500 Index|S&P 500 index]]. The formula for RRR using the CAPM model is as follows:

RRR\=[[Risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]]+beta(Market rate of return−Risk-free rate of return)RRR = \\text{Risk-free rate of return}\\; + \\; beta\\left( \\text{Market rate of return}- \\text{Risk-free rate of return}\\right)

### Calculating RRR using CAPM

1.  Add the current [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]] to the beta of the [[Security|security]].
2.  Take the market rate of [[Return|return]] and subtract the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of return.
3.  Add the results to achieve the required rate of [[Return|return]].

Subtract the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]] from the market rate of return.

Take that result and multiply it by the beta of the [[Security|security]].

Add the result to the current [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]] to determine the required rate of return.

### Key Takeaways

-   The required rate of [[Return|return]] is the minimum return an investor [[Will|will]] accept for owning a company's [[Stock|stock]], that compensates them for a given level of [[Risk|risk]].
-   Inflation must also be factored into an RRR calculation, which finds the minimum rate of [[Return|return]] an investor considers acceptable, taking into account their [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]], inflation and the return available on other investments.
-   The RRR is a subjective minimum rate of [[Return|return]], and a retiree [[Will|will]] have a lower [[Risk|risk]] tolerance and therefore accept a smaller return than an investor who recently graduated college.

## What Does RRR Tell You?

[The required rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/11/calculating-required-rate-of-[[Return|return]].asp) RRR is a key concept in [[Equity|equity]] valuation and corporate [[Finance|finance]]. It's a difficult metric to pinpoint due to the different investment goals and [[Risk|risk]] tolerance of individual investors and companies. Risk-return preferences, inflation expectations, and a company’s capital structure all play a role in determining the company's own required rate. Each one of these and other factors can have major effects on a [[Security|security]]'s [[intrinsic value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp). 

For investors using the CAPM formula, the required rate of [[Return|return]] for a [[Stock|stock]] with a high beta relative to the market should have a higher RRR. The higher RRR relative to other investments with low betas is necessary to compensate investors for the added level of [[Risk|risk]] associated with investing in the higher beta stock.

In other words, RRR is in part calculated by adding the [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] to the expected risk-free rate of [[Return|return]] to account for the added [[Volatility|volatility]] and subsequent risk.

For capital projects, RRR is useful in determining whether to pursue one project versus another. The RRR is what's needed to go ahead with the project although some projects might not meet the RRR but are in the long-term best interests of the company.

Inflation must also be factored into RRR analysis. The RRR on a [[Stock|stock]] is the minimum rate of [[Return|return]] on a stock that an investor considers acceptable, taking into account their [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020415/what-difference-between-cost-capital-and-required-return.asp), inflation and the return available on other investments.

For example, if inflation is 3% per year, and the [[Equity|equity]] [[Risk|risk]] [[Premium|premium]] over the risk-free [[Return|return]] (using a U.S. Treasury bill which returns 3%), then an investor might require a return of 9% per year to make the [[Stock|stock]] investment worthwhile. This is because a 9% return is really a 6% return after inflation, which means the investor would not be rewarded for the risk they were taking. They would receive the same risk-adjusted return by investing in the 3% yielding Treasury bill, which would have a zero real rate of return after adjusting for inflation.

## Examples of RRR

A company is expected to pay an annual dividend of $3 next year, and its [[Stock|stock]] is currently trading at $100 a share. The company has been steadily raising its dividend each year at a 4% growth rate.

-   **RRR = 7% or (($3 expected dividend / $100 per share) + 0.04 growth rate)**

In the [[capital asset pricing model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp) (CAPM), RRR can be calculated using the beta of a [[Security|security]], or [[Risk|risk]] coefficient, as well as the excess [[Return|return]] that investing in the [[Stock|stock]] pays over a risk-free rate, is the [[equity risk premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityriskpremium.asp).

## RRR Using CAPM Formula Example

-   A company has a beta of 1.50 meaning it's riskier than the overall market's beta of one.
-   The current [[Risk|risk]]-free rate is 2% on a short-term U.S. Treasury.
-   The long-term average rate of [[Return|return]] for the market is 10%.
-   RRR = 14% or (0.02 + 1.50 x (0.10 - 0.02)).

## RRR vs. [[Cost of Capital]]

Although the required rate of [[Return|return]] is used in capital budgeting projects, RRR is not the same level of return that's needed to cover the [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp). The [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] is the minimum return needed to cover the [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]] and issuing [[Equity|equity]] to raise funds for the project. The cost of capital is the lowest return needed to account for the capital structure. The RRR should always be higher than the cost of capital.

## Limitations of RRR

The RRR calculation does not factor in inflation expectations since rising prices erode investment gains. However, inflation expectations are subjective and can be wrong.

Also, the RRR [[Will|will]] vary between investors with different [[Risk|risk]] tolerance levels. A retiree will have a lower risk tolerance than an investor who recently graduated college. As a result, the RRR is a subjective rate of [[Return|return]].

RRR does not factor in the [[Liquidity|liquidity]] of an investment. If an investment can't be sold for a period of time, the [[Security|security]] [[Will|will]] likely carry a higher [[Risk|risk]] than one that's more liquid.

Also, comparing [[Stocks|stocks]] in different industries can be difficult since the [[Risk|risk]] or beta [[Will|will]] be different. As with any financial ratio or metric, it's best to utilize multiple ratios in your analysis when considering investment opportunities.
