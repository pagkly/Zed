[[How Does a Tax Lien Work]]?
## What Is a Tax [[Lien]]?

A tax [[Lien|lien]] is a legal claim against the assets of an individual or business that fails to pay taxes owed to the government. In general, a lien serves to guarantee payment of a [[Debt|debt]] such as a [[Loan|loan]], or in this case, taxes. If the obligation is not satisfied, the [[Creditor|creditor]] may proceed to seize the assets.

### Key Takeaways

-   If a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] does not respond to a demand for payment, the government may place a [[Lien|lien]] on the person's assets.
-   The [[Lien|lien]] may be removed if the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] agrees to a payment plan or takes other action with the agreement of the government.
-   If no attempt to repay is made, the government may seize the assets for sale.

## Understanding a Tax [[Lien]]

The federal or state government can place a tax [[Lien|lien]] on a property if the owner is in arrears on income taxes. Local governments may place a lien on a property for nonpayment of property or local income taxes.

The [[Lien|lien]] does not mean that the property [[Will|will]] be sold. Rather, it ensures that the tax authority gets the first claim over any other creditors vying for the [[Creditor|creditor]]'s assets.

## The Process of a Tax [[Lien]]

The process begins when a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] gets a letter that details how much is owed. This is known as a notice and demand for payment.

If the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] fails to pay the [[Debt|debt]] or attempt to resolve it with the IRS, the agency can place a [[Lien|lien]] on the person's assets.

This [[Lien|lien]] attaches to all of a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]’s assets, including securities, property, and vehicles. Any assets the taxpayer acquires while the lien is in effect also apply. It also attaches to any business property and the accounts receivable for the business.

If the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] chooses to file for [bankruptcy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp), the [[Lien|lien]] and the tax [[Debt|debt]] could continue even after the bankruptcy. Most debts are wiped out by bankruptcy proceedings, but not federal tax debt.1 

## What the IRS Can Do

In the U.S., the IRS may place a [[Lien|lien]] against a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]'s home, vehicle, and bank accounts if federal tax payments are delinquent and there has been no demonstrated effort to pay the taxes owed.

A federal tax [[Lien|lien]] has precedence over all other creditors' claims. It also makes it difficult for the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] to sell the assets or to obtain credit.

The only way to release a federal tax [[Lien|lien]] is to fully pay the tax owed or reach a settlement with the IRS.

Once a [[Lien|lien]] has been filed, it used to show up on the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]'s [[credit report]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp), damaging the person's [[Credit Score|credit score]]. This could also prevent the taxpayer from selling or refinancing any assets to which liens have been attached. Note that since 2018, the 3 major credit reporting agencies have stopped including tax liens on credit reports.2

The [[Lien|lien]] [[Will|will]] remain in place until the tax bill is resolved or the [[statute of limitations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statute-of-limitations.asp) on the [[Debt|debt]] expires.

The IRS has the authority to seize the assets of a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] who ignores a tax [[Lien|lien]].

## Getting out of a Tax [[Lien]]

The simplest way to get out of a federal tax [[Lien|lien]] is to pay the taxes owed. However, if this is not possible, there are other ways to deal with a lien with the cooperation of the IRS.

-   The IRS [[Will|will]] consider releasing a tax [[Lien|lien]] if the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] agrees to a payment plan with an automatic withdrawal monthly until the [[Debt|debt]] is satisfied.
-   The [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] may be able to [[discharge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]]-discharge.asp) a specific property, effectively removing it from the [[Lien|lien]]. Not all taxpayers or properties are eligible for discharge. IRS [[Publication 783]](https://www.irs.gov/pub/default_path_no_value/p783.pdf) details regulations about discharging property.
-   Subordination does not actually remove the [[Lien|lien]] from any property but it sometimes makes it easier for the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] to obtain another mortgage or [[Loan|loan]]. IRS [[Form 14134]](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14134.pdf) is used to apply for such action.
-   Yet another process, withdrawal of notice, removes the public notice of a federal tax [[Lien|lien]]. The [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] is still liable for the [[Debt|debt]], but under withdrawal, the IRS does not compete with any other creditors for the [[Debtor|debtor]]’s property. [[Form 12277]](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f12277.pdf) is the application.

If repaying the taxes is simply impossible, the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] must pay as much of the [[Debt|debt]] as possible and seek dismissal of the balance in [[bankruptcy court]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy-court.asp).

## What Happens Next

If the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can use a tax levy to legally seize the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]'s assets in order to collect the money it is owed.

While a [[Lien|lien]] secures the government’s interest or claim in the property, a levy permits the government to seize and sell the property in order to pay the tax [[Debt|debt]].

## Once It's Over

Tax liens are publicly recorded. After a tax [[Debtor|debtor]] pays off the [[Debt|debt]], the county records [[Will|will]] be updated to reflect the fact that the [[Lien|lien]] has been released.
