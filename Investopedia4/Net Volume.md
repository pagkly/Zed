[[Net Volume]]
## What Is [[Net Volume]]?

[[Net Volume|Net volume]] is a [[technical indicator]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp) calculated by subtracting a [[Security|security]]'s [[uptick volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickvolume.asp) by its [[downtick volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtickvolume.asp) over a specified period of time. Unlike standard volume, the indicator differentiates whether the [[Market Sentiment|market sentiment]] is leaning bullish or bearish. Net volume is typically plotted below the price chart with bars for each period indicating the net volume reading for that period.

## Understanding [[Net Volume]]

[[Net Volume|Net volume]] is used by traders to assess [[market sentiment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsentiment.asp) beyond the use of standard volume. Positive net volume suggests that a [[Security|security]] is experiencing a bullish upswing, while negative net volume suggests that a security is experiencing a bearish [[downswing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downswing.asp).

For example, suppose that a [[thinly traded]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thinly-traded.asp) [[Stock|stock]] experienced five downward trades at 200 [[Shares|shares]] a piece, moving down a total of five percent, and one upward trade at 10,000 shares, moving the stock up three percent. The stock may have closed two percent lower, but the [[Net Volume|net volume]] would have been a positive 9,000, suggesting that the [[momentum]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[Momentum|momentum]].asp) has really been bullish under the surface.

Here's an example of a chart showing [[Net Volume|net volume]]:

Many traders use [[Net Volume|net volume]] in conjunction with other forms of [[technical analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp), including technical indicators and chart patterns, when looking for potential opportunities. For instance, traders might determine that a [[Stock|stock]] broke out from a key [[resistance level]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp) and then look at net volume to determine how much buying pressure is behind the move and if there's enough [[Momentum|momentum]] moving forward.

## Comparing [[Net Volume]]

[[Net Volume|Net volume]] is similar to many other [[Momentum|momentum]] indicators that look at volume along with various other factors. Unlike these other indicators, net volume looks exclusively at volume over a single timeframe.

For example, [[Net Volume|net volume]] is similar to the [money flow index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfi.asp), in that both technical indicators measure market interest in a given [[Security|security]], but the MFI uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure rather than just looking at volume. Net volume is also similar to [[on balance volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp), in that both technical indicators look at volume changes, but OBV adds up volume on up days and down days over time rather than looking at a single period. Other indicators, like the [[relative strength index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp), look at the magnitude of gains or losses to provide insights.

Many traders tend to use more complex [[Momentum|momentum]] indicators than [[Net Volume|net volume]] when analyzing opportunities, but it may still play a role in certain cases where the trader needs to only look at a single period.
