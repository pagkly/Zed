[[Follow on Public Offer (FPO)]]
## What Is a Follow-on Public [[Offer]] (FPO)?

A follow-on public [[Offering|offering]] (FPO) is the issuance of [[Shares|shares]] to investors by a company [[Listed|listed]] on a [[Stock|stock]] [[exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp). A follow-on offering is an issuance of additional shares made by a company after an initial public offering (IPO). Follow-on offerings are also known as [[secondary offerings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A follow-on public [[Offer|offer]] (FPO), also known as a secondary [[Offering|offering]], is the additional issuance of [[Shares|shares]] after the initial public offering (IPO). 
-   Companies usually announce FPOs to raise [[Equity|equity]] or reduce [[Debt|debt]].
-   The two main types of FPOs are dilutive—meaning new [[Shares|shares]] are added—and non-dilutive—meaning existing private shares are sold publicly.
-   An at-the-market [[Offering|offering]] (ATM) is a type of FPO by which a company can [[Offer|offer]] secondary public [[Shares|shares]] on any given day, usually depending on the prevailing market price, to raise capital.

## How a Follow-on Public [[Offer]] (FPO) Works

Public companies can also take advantage of an FPO through an [[Offer|offer]] document. FPOs should not be confused with IPOs, the [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) of [[Equity|equity]] to the public. FPOs are additional issues made after a company is established on an exchange.

## Types of Follow-on Public Offers

There are two main types of follow-on public offers. The first is [[dilutive]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp) to investors, as the company’s Board of Directors agrees to increase the share float level or the number of [[Shares|shares]] available. This kind of follow-on public [[Offering|offering]] seeks to raise money to reduce [[Debt|debt]] or expand the business, resulting in an increase in the number of shares outstanding.

The other type of follow-on public [[Offer|offer]] is non-dilutive. This approach is useful when directors or substantial shareholders sell-off privately held [[Shares|shares]].

### Diluted Follow-on [[Offering]]

Diluted follow-on offerings happen when a company issues additional [[Shares|shares]] to raise funding and [[Offer|offer]] those shares to the public market. As the number of shares increase, the [earnings per share (EPS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) decrease. The funds raised during an FPO are most frequently allocated to reduce [[Debt|debt]] or change a company's capital structure. The infusion of cash is good for the long-term outlook of the company, and thus, it is also good for its shares.

### Non-Diluted Follow-on [[Offering]]

Non-diluted follow-on offerings happen when holders of existing, privately-held [[Shares|shares]] bring previously issued shares to the public market for sale. Cash proceeds from non-diluted sales go directly to the shareholders placing the [[Stock|stock]] into the open market.

In many cases, these shareholders are company founders, members of the board of directors, or pre-IPO investors. Since no new [[Shares|shares]] are issued, the company's EPS remains [[Unchanged|unchanged]]. Non-diluted follow-on offerings are also called secondary market offerings.

### At-the-Market [[Offering]] (ATM)

An at-the-market (ATM) [[Offering|offering]] gives the issuing company the ability to raise capital as needed. If the company is not satisfied with the available price of [[Shares|shares]] on a given day, it can refrain from offering shares. ATM offerings are sometimes referred to as controlled [[Equity|equity]] distributions because of their ability to sell shares into the secondary trading market at the current prevailing price.

## Example of a Follow-on [[Offering]]

Follow-on offerings are common in the investment world. They provide an easy way for companies to raise [[Equity|equity]] that can be used for common purposes. Companies announcing secondary offerings may see their share price fall as a result. Shareholders often react negatively to secondary offerings because they dilute existing [[Shares|shares]] and many are introduced below market prices.

In 2015, many companies had follow-on offerings after [[Going Public|going public]] less than a year prior. Shake Shack was one company that saw [[Shares|shares]] fall after news of a secondary [[Offering|offering]]. Shares fell 16% on news of a substantial secondary offering that came in below the existing share price.

In 2017, follow-on offerings produced $142.3 billion in [[Equity|equity]] raised for companies. There were a total of 737 FPOs in 2017. This marked a 21% jump in the number of FPOs versus 2016. However, the value of FPOs was down 3% year-over-year in 2017.
