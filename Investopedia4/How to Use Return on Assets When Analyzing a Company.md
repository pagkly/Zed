[[How to Use Return on Assets When Analyzing a Company]]
## What Is [[Return]] on Assets (ROA)?

[[Return]] on assets (ROA) is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives a manager, [[investor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp), or analyst an idea as to how efficient a company's management is at [[using its assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return-on-assets-managed-roam.asp) to generate earnings. Return on assets is displayed as a percentage; the higher the ROA the better.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Return]] on Assets (ROA) is an indicator of how well a company utilizes its assets in terms of profitability.
-   ROA is best used when comparing similar companies or by comparing a company to its own previous performance.
-   ROA takes into account a company’s [[Debt|debt]], unlike other similar metrics like [[Return]] on [[Equity]] (ROE).

## The Basics of [[Return]] on Assets

Businesses (at least the ones that survive) are ultimately about efficiency: squeezing the most out of limited resources. Comparing profits to revenue is a useful operational metric, but comparing them to the resources a company used to earn them cuts to the very feasibility of that company's existence. [[Return]] on assets (ROA) is the simplest of such corporate bang-for-the-buck measures.

ROA is [[calculated]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031215/what-formula-calculating-[[Return|return]]-assets-roa.asp) by dividing a company’s [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) by total assets. As a formula, it would be expressed as:

[[Return]] on Assets\=Net IncomeTotal AssetsReturn\\ on\\ Assets = \\frac{Net\\ Income}{Total\\ Assets}

Higher ROA indicates more asset efficiency.

For example, pretend Spartan Sam and Fancy Fran both start hot dog stands. Sam spends $1,500 on a bare-bones metal cart, while Fran spends $15,000 on a zombie apocalypse-themed unit, complete with costume. Let's assume that those were the only assets each firm deployed. If over some given period Sam had earned $150 and Fran had earned $1,200, Fran would have the more valuable business but Sam would have the more efficient one. Using the above formula, we see Sam’s simplified ROA is $150/$1,500 = 10%, while Fran’s simplified ROA is $1,200/$15,000 = 8%.

## The Significance of [[Return]] on Assets

[[Return]] on assets (ROA), in basic terms, tells you what earnings were generated from [[invested capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invested-capital.asp) (assets). ROA for public companies can vary substantially and [[Will|will]] be highly dependent on the industry. This is why when using ROA as a comparative measure, it is best to compare it against a company's previous ROA numbers or a similar company's ROA.

The ROA figure gives investors an idea of how effective the company is in converting the money it invests into net income. The higher the ROA number, the better, because the company is earning more money on less investment.

Because of the balance sheet [[accounting equation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-equation.asp), note that that total assets are also the sum of its total liabilities and [[shareholder's equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp). Both of these types of financing are used to fund the operations of the company. Since a company's assets are either funded by [[Debt|debt]] or [[Equity|equity]], some analysts and investors disregard the cost of acquiring the asset by adding back [[interest expense]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp) in the formula for ROA.

In other words, the impact of taking more [[Debt|debt]] is negated by adding back the cost of borrowing to the [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) and using the average assets in a given period as the denominator. Interest expense is added because the net income amount on the income statement excludes interest expense.

## Example of How to Use [[Return]] on Assets

ROA is most useful for comparing companies in the same industry, as different industries use assets differently. For example, the ROA for service-oriented firms, such as banks, [[Will|will]] be significantly higher than the ROA for [[capital-intensive]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalintensive.asp) companies, such as construction or utility companies.

Let's evaluate the [[Return|return]] on assets (ROA) for three companies in the retail industry:

-   Macy's (M)
-   Kohl’s (KSS)
-   Dillard's (DDS)

The data in the table is for the [[trailing twelve months]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) as of Feb. 13, 2019.

**Company**

**Net Income**

**Total Assets**

**ROA**

Macy's

$1.7 billion

$20.4 billion

8.3%

Kohl's

$996 million

$14.1 billion

7.1%

Dillard's

$243 million

$3.9 billion

6.2%

Due to the increasing popularity of e-[[Commerce|commerce]], and the coronavirus pandemic, [[brick and mortar]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brickandmortar.asp) retail companies have taken a hit in the level of profits they generate using their available assets. Still, every dollar that Macy's has invested in assets generates 8.3 cents of net income. Macy's is better at converting its investment into profits, compared with Kohl’s and Dillard’s. One of management's most important jobs is to make wise choices in allocating its resources, and it appears Macy’s management is more adept than its two peers.

## [[Return]] on Assets vs. Return on [[Equity]]

Both ROA and [[return on equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) (ROE) are measures of how a company utilizes its resources. Essentially, ROE only measures the [[Return|return]] on a company’s [[Equity|equity]], leaving out the liabilities. Thus, ROA accounts for a company’s [[Debt|debt]] and ROE does not. The more [[Leverage|leverage]] and debt a company takes on, the higher ROE [[Will|will]] be relative to ROA.

## Limitations of [[Return]] on Assets

The biggest issue with [[Return|return]] on assets (ROA) is that it can't be used across industries. That’s because companies in one industry—such as the technology industry—and another industry like oil drillers [[Will|will]] have different [[asset bases]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-base.asp).

Some analysts also feel that the basic ROA formula is limited in its applications, being most suitable for banks. Bank balance sheets better represent the real value of their assets and liabilities because they’re carried at market value (via [[mark-to-market accounting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marktomarket.asp)), or at least an estimate of market value, versus historical cost. Both interest expense and interest income are already factored in.

The St. Louis Federal Reserve provides [[data on US bank ROAs]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USROA), which have generally hovered around or just above 1% since 1984, the year collection started.

For non-financial companies, [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]] capital is strictly segregated, as are the returns to each: interest expense is the [[Return|return]] for debt providers; net income is the return for equity investors. So the common ROA formula jumbles things up by comparing returns to equity investors (net income) with assets funded by both debt and equity investors (total assets). Two variations on this ROA formula fix this numerator-denominator inconsistency by putting interest expense (net of taxes) back into the numerator. So the formulas would be:

-   _ROA variation 1_: Net Income + \[Interest Expense\*(1-tax rate)\] / Total Assets
-   _ROA variation 2_: Operating Income\*(1-tax rate) / Total Assets

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What do you mean by [[Return|return]] on assets?

[[Return]] on assets, or ROA, measures how much money a company earns by putting its assets to use. In other words, ROA is an indicator of how efficient or profitable a company is relative to its assets or the resources it owns or controls.

### How is ROA used by investors?

Investors can use [[Return|return]] on assets to find [[Stock|stock]] opportunities because the ROA shows how efficient a company is at using its assets to generate profits. An ROA that rises over time indicates the company is doing a good job of increasing its profits with each investment dollar it spends. A falling ROA indicates the company might have over-invested in assets that have failed to produce revenue growth, a sign the company may be in some trouble. ROA can also be used to make apples-to-apples comparisons across companies in the same sector or industry.

### How can I calculate a company's ROA?

ROA is calculated simply by dividing a firm's net income by total average assets. It is then expressed as a percentage.

Net profit can be found at the bottom of a company's income statement, and assets are found on its balance sheet. Average total assets are used in calculating ROA because a company's asset total can vary over time due to the purchase or sale of vehicles, land or equipment, inventory changes, or seasonal sales fluctuations. As a result, calculating the average total assets for the period in question is more accurate than the total assets for one period.

Note that there are alternative methods for arriving at ROA as well.

### What is considered a good ROA?

ROAs over 5% are generally considered good and over 20% excellent. However, ROAs should always be compared amongst firms in the same sector. A software maker, for instance, [[Will|will]] have far fewer assets on the balance sheet than a car maker. As a result, the software company's assets will be understated, and its ROA may get a questionable boost.
