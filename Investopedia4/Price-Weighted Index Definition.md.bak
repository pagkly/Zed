[[Price-Weighted Index Definition]]
## What Is a Price-[[Weighted]] Index?

A price-[[Weighted|weighted]] index is a [[stock index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) in which each company included in the index makes up a fraction of the total index proportional to that company's share [[Stock|stock]] price per share. In its simplest form, adding the price of each stock in the index and dividing by the total number of companies determines the index's [[value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp).

A [[Stock|stock]] with a higher price [[Will|will]] be given more weight than a stock with a lower price and will thus have a greater influence on the index's performance.

### Key Takeaways

-   In a price-[[Weighted|weighted]] [[Stock|stock]] index, each company's stock is weighted by its price per share, and the index is an average of the share prices of all the companies.
-   Price-[[Weighted|weighted]] indexes give greater weight to [[Stocks|stocks]] with higher prices in terms of their contribution to the index value and changes in the index.Â 
-   A price-[[Weighted|weighted]] index can be used to track the average [[Stock|stock]] price of a given market or industry.

## Understanding a Price-[[Weighted]] Index

In a price-[[Weighted|weighted]] index, a [[stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp) that increases from $110 to $120 [[Will|will]] have the same effect on the index as a stock that increases from $10 to $20, even though the percentage move for the latter is far greater than that of the higher-priced stock. Higher-priced [[Stocks|stocks]] exert a greater influence on the index's, or the [[basket's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basket.asp), overall direction.

To calculate the value of a simple price-[[Weighted|weighted]] index, find the sum of the share prices of the individual companies, and divide by the number of companies. In some averages, this divisor is adjusted in order to maintain continuity in the event of [[Stock|stock]] splits or changes to the list of companies included in the index.

Price-[[Weighted|weighted]] indexes are useful because the index value [[Will|will]] be equal to (or at least proportionate to) the average [[Stock|stock]] price for the companies included in the index. This allows the construction of indexes that will track the average stock price performance of a specific sector or market.

One of the most popular price-[[Weighted|weighted]] [[Stocks|stocks]] is the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp), which consists of 30 different stocks, or components. In this index, the higher-price stocks move the index more than those with lower prices, thus the price-weighted designation. The [[Nikkei]] 225 is another example of a price-weighted index.

## Other [[Weighted]] Indexes

In addition to price-[[Weighted|weighted]] indexes, other basic types of weighted indexes include [[value-weighted indexes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp) and [[unweighted indexes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unweightedindex.asp). For a value-weighted index, like those in the [[MSCI]] family of strategy indexes, the number of outstanding [[Shares|shares]] is a factor. To determine the weight of each [[Stock|stock]] in a value-weighted index, the price of the stock is multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.

For example, if [[Stock]] A has five million outstanding [[Shares|shares]] and is trading at $15, then its weight in the index is $75 million. If Stock B is trading at $30, but only has one million outstanding shares, its weight is $30 million. So, in a value-[[Weighted|weighted]] index, Stock A would have more say in how the index moves than Stock B.

In an unweighted index, all [[Stocks|stocks]] have the same impact on the index, no matter their share [[volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) or [[price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quoted-price.asp). Any price change in the index is based on the [[Return|return]] percentage of each component. For example, if [[Stock]] A is up 30%, Stock B is up 20%, and Stock C is up 10%, the index is up 20%, or (30 + 20 + 10)/3 (i.e., the number of stocks in the index).

Another type of [[Weighted|weighted]] index is the [[market capitalization-weighted index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp), where the [[Shares|shares]] of each [[Stock|stock]] are based on the market value of the outstanding shares. Other types of weighted indexes include revenue-weighted, [[fundamentally weighted]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentally_weighted_index.asp), and float-adjusted. All have their positives and negatives, depending on the investor's goals and market knowledge.
