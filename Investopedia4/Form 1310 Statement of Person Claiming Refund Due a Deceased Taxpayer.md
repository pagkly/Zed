Form 1310: Statement of Person Claiming Refund Due a Deceased [[Taxpayer]]
## What Is Form 1310: Statement of Person Claiming Refund Due a Deceased [[Taxpayer]]?

### Key Takeaways

-   IRS Form 1310 is used to claim a federal tax refund due to a recently deceased [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]].
-   In general, Form 1310 is filed by a surviving spouse or the executor of an [[Estate|estate]].
-   The person filing must submit a Form 1040 along with Form 1310.

## Who Can File Form 1310: Statement of Person Claiming Refund Due a Deceased [[Taxpayer]]?

In general, a surviving spouse or the [[executor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp) of an [[estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Estate|estate]].asp) files [[IRS]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) Form 1310. To become the executor, an individual must be named in the deceased’s [[Will|will]]. In the absence of a will, a [[probate court]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Probate|probate]]-court.asp) will name an individual to handle the executor’s duties. This person is known as a personal representative or administrator.

[[Probate]] courts vary from state to state, but they generally consider a hierarchy of candidates to serve as personal representative. This list begins with a spouse and other close relatives and continues to include more distant relatives and [[creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp).1

## How to File Form 1310: Statement of Person Claiming Refund Due a Deceased [[Taxpayer]]

If the executor or personal representative is filing a full [[Tax Return|tax return]] on behalf of the deceased individual, they must submit [[Form 1040]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp) along with Form 1310 directing the IRS to pay a refund. The executor may also need to file taxes owed by the [[Estate|estate]] rather than the individual. In this case, the representative [[Will|will]] be required to file a Form 1041 along with a 1310 form. The 1041 form would be required only if the estate generates more than $600 in income per year.2

If filing a Form 1310 along with a Form 1041, the executor must be aware that the IRS [[Will|will]] issue the refund to the [[Estate|estate]] rather than to any individual. Executors should always request a physical check rather than an electronic refund because most banks will not send money to a differently titled account without special authorization.1

Form 1310 must be mailed to the IRS—you cannot e-file it.

Form 1310 asks a series of identifying questions and requests legal documentation of the [[taxpayer’s status]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/filingstatus.asp) and executor's appointment. First, it asks the filer of the form to explain their role and justification for requesting the refund.

A surviving spouse need not submit a death certificate if they are requesting a refund check made out to both spouses. This is because a refund check would have referenced both taxpayers' names prior to the spouse’s death.3

A personal representative must submit their court certificate in order to request a refund. In the absence of a court appointment, the filing individual must submit a copy of the death certificate and answer questions on Form 1310.3

All pages of Form 1310 are available on the IRS website.4
