[[Should You Be Open to a Closed-End Fund]]?
## What Is a Closed-End Fund?

A closed-end fund is a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of pooled assets that raises a fixed amount of capital through an [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO) and then lists [[Shares|shares]] for trade on a [[Stock|stock]] exchange.

Like a mutual fund, a closed-end fund has a professional manager overseeing the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] and actively buying and selling holding assets. Similar to an exchange-traded fund, it trades like [[Equity|equity]], as its price fluctuates throughout the trading day. However, the closed-end fund is unique in that, after its IPO, the fund's parent company issues no additional [[Shares|shares]], and the fund itself won't redeem—buy back—shares. Instead, like individual [[Stock|stock]] shares, the fund can only be bought or sold on the secondary market by investors.

Other names for a closed-end fund include the "closed-end investment" and "closed-end mutual fund."

## How a Closed-End Fund Works

While a closed-end fund has several unique characteristics that distinguish it from an [[open-end fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-endfund.asp), such as a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), it also [[Shares|shares]] several similarities with those two securities. Both closed-end funds and open-end funds are run by an investment advisor, through a management team that trades the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. Both also charge an annual [[expense ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp) and can make income and capital [[Gain|gain]] distributions to shareholders.

A closed-end fund is organized as a publicly traded [[investment company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentcompany.asp), and both it and its [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] need a [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]] registration.1 It tends to be actively managed unlike most ETFs or index mutual funds, and its [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of securities typically concentrates on a specific industry, geographic market, or market sector.

### Key Takeaways

-   A closed-end fund is created when an investment company raises money through an IPO and then trades its [[Shares|shares]] on the public market like a [[Stock|stock]].
-   Closed-end funds often [[Offer|offer]] higher returns or better income streams than their [[Open-End Fund|open-end fund]] counterparts.
-   The price of a closed-end fund fluctuates according to [[Supply|supply]] and demand, as well as the changing values of its [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s [[Holdings|holdings]].

## How Closed-End Funds Differ

However, closed-end funds differ from open-ended funds in fundamental ways. A closed-end fund raises a prescribed amount of capital only once, through an IPO, by issuing a fixed number of [[Shares|shares]], purchased by investors. After all the shares sell the [[Offering|offering]] is "closed"—hence, the name. No new investment capital flows into the fund.

In contrast, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds constantly accept new investor dollars, issuing additional [[Shares|shares]], and redeeming—or buying back—shares from shareholders who wish to sell.

A closed-end funds list on [[Stock|stock]] exchanges where their [[Shares|shares]] trade just like [[Stocks|stocks]] with share price movements throughout the trading day. This listing activity contrasts with open-end mutual funds, which price shares only once, at the end of the trading day. While the [[Open-End Fund|open-end fund]]'s share price is based on the [[net asset value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp) ([NAV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp)) of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]], the stock price of a closed-end fund fluctuates according to market forces. These forces include [[Supply|supply]] and demand, as well as the changing values of the securities in the fund's [[Holdings|holdings]].

Because they trade exclusively in the secondary market, closed-end funds also require a brokerage account to buy and sell. An [[Open-End Fund|open-end fund]] can often be purchased directly through the fund's sponsoring investment company.

## Closed-End Funds and Net Asset Value

One of the unique features of a closed-end fund is how it is priced. The NAV of the fund is calculated regularly. However, the price that it trades for on the exchange is determined entirely by [[Supply|supply]] and demand. This investor demand can lead to a closed-end fund trading [[at a premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-a-[[Premium|premium]].asp) or a discount to its NAV. A premium price means the price of a share is above the NAV, while a discount is the opposite, below NAV, value.

Closed-end funds can trade at premiums and discounts for several reasons. They may be focused on a popular sector and reflect the sentiment of that sector. These funds may also trade at a [[Premium|premium]] if a historically successful [[Stock|stock]] picker manages the fund. Conversely, a lack of investor demand or a poor [[risk and return profile]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp) for the fund can lead to it trading at a discount to its NAV.

As mentioned earlier, closed-end funds do not repurchase [[Shares|shares]] from investors, but investors may trade the shares between one another. Because closed-end funds do not redeem investor shares, they don't maintain large cash reserve levels leaving them with more funds to invest. They can also make heavy use of [[Leverage|leverage]]—borrowing capital—to increase returns. As a result, closed-end funds often [[Offer|offer]] higher returns or better income streams than their open-fund mutual fund counterparts.

## Examples of Closed-End Funds

The largest type of closed-end fund—evaluated by assets under management—is municipal bond funds. These large funds invest in [[Debt|debt]] obligations of state and local governments and government agencies. Managers of these funds often seek broad [[Diversification|diversification]] to minimize [[Risk|risk]], but also often rely on [[Leverage|leverage]] to maximize returns.

Managers also build global and international funds with [[Stocks|stocks]] or fixed-income instruments worldwide. These include global funds, which combine U.S. and international securities, international funds, which purchase only non-U.S. securities, and emerging markets funds, which can be highly volatile and less liquid due to the countries where they invest.

One of the largest closed-end funds is the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversified [[Equity]] Income Fund ([EXG](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=exg)). Founded in 2007, it has a market cap of US$2.23 billion as of March 2020.2 The primary investment objective is to provide current income and gains, with a secondary objective of capital appreciation.
