[[Medallion Signature Guarantee]]
## What Is a [[Medallion Signature Guarantee]]?

A [[Medallion Signature Guarantee|medallion signature guarantee]] is one of several special certification stamps that guarantees a signature that authorizes a [[transfer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfer.asp) of securities is authentic. Parties [[Will|will]] generally require a medallion signature guarantee when an owner wants to sell or transfer securities, such as [[Stocks|stocks]] or bonds, held in physical certificate form. If an owner holds securities through a [[broker]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp), they will not need to obtain a signature guarantee to sell or transfer the securities.

## How Medallion Signature Guarantees Work

In order to provide a [[Medallion Signature Guarantee|Medallion signature guarantee]], an institution must be a member of one of three Medallion signature guarantee programs: the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the [[Stock]] Exchanges Medallion Program, and the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Program. 

Normally, you can obtain a [[Medallion Signature Guarantee|Medallion signature guarantee]] at a financial institution where you are already a customer. The bank may assess a small charge for this service.

## Special Considerations 

A [[Medallion Signature Guarantee|medallion signature guarantee]] often corresponds with a [[share certificate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/share-certificate.asp). A [[Share Certificate|share certificate]] (or [[Stock|stock]] certificate) is a written document that serves as legal proof of ownership of a set number of a company’s [[Shares|shares]]. 

This is in contrast with owning a [[bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), a form of [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]], in which a separate party loans money to a company or the government. Key information on a [[Share Certificate|share certificate]] generally includes the following:

-   Certificate number
-   Company name and registration number
-   Shareholder name and address
-   Number of [[Shares|shares]] owned
-   [[Class of shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/class.asp)
-   Issue date of [[Shares|shares]]
-   Amount paid (or treated as paid) on the [[Shares|shares]]

[[Shares]] may be issued in separate classes. For example, Berkshire Hathaway offers stockholders Class A (BRK.A) and Class B (BRK.B) shares. A number of other well-known companies have dual-class structures, such as Ford (F), Facebook (FB), and Groupon (GRPN). Meanwhile, some companies have multiple share classes—where Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG) has three classes of shares. 

Each class offers different rights to the stockholder with regard to dividends and voting options. At times the owner of a [[Stock|stock]] certificate can give a proxy to another person to allow them to vote with said [[Shares|shares]] on matters of company policy.

If a [[Share Certificate|share certificate]] is damaged, lost, or stolen, the company may issue a replacement certificate. In such a case, the shareholder must [[Return|return]] the damaged document. Share certificates may either be registered or in bearer form. A bearer share certificate entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the [[Stock|stock]].

Today individual investors rarely have physical possession of their share certificates, preferring electronic records instead.
