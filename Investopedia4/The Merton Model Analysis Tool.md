[[The Merton Model Analysis Tool]]
## What Is the Merton Model?

The Merton model is an analysis model used to assess the [[credit risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) of a company's [[Debt|debt]]. Analysts and investors utilize the Merton model to understand how capable a company is at meeting financial obligations, servicing its debt, and weighing the general possibility that it [[Will|will]] go into credit [[Default|default]].

In 1974, economist Robert C. Merton proposed this model for assessing the structural credit [[Risk|risk]] of a company by modeling the company's [[Equity|equity]] as a [[call option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on its assets. This model was later extended by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes to develop the Nobel-prize winning Black-Scholes pricing model for options.

## The Formula for the Merton Model Is

E\=VtN(d1)−Ke−rΔTN(d2)where:d1\=ln⁡VtK+(r+σv22)ΔTσvΔTandd2\=d1−σvΔtE = Theoretical value of a company’s equityVt\=Value of the company’s assets in period tK = Value of the company’s debtt = Current time periodT = Future time periodr = [[Risk]]-free interest rateN = Cumulative standard normal distributione = Exponential term(i.e. 2.7183...)σ\=Standard deviation of [[Stock|stock]] returns\\begin{aligned} &E=V\_tN\\left(d\_1\\right)-Ke^{-r\\Delta{T}}N\\left(d\_2\\right)\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &d\_1=\\frac{\\ln{\\frac{V\_t}{K}}+\\left(r+\\frac{\\sigma\_v^2}{2}\\right)\\Delta{T}}{\\sigma\_v\\sqrt{\\Delta{T}}}\\\\ &\\text{and}\\\\ &d\_2=d\_1-\\sigma\_v\\sqrt{\\Delta{t}}\\\\ &\\text{E = Theoretical value of a company's [[Equity|equity]]}\\\\ &V\_t=\\text{Value of the company's assets in period t}\\\\ &\\text{K = Value of the company's [[Debt|debt]]}\\\\ &\\text{t = Current time period}\\\\ &\\text{T = Future time period}\\\\ &\\text{r = Risk-free interest rate}\\\\ &\\text{N = Cumulative standard [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]}\\\\ &\\text{e = Exponential term}\\left(i.e. \\text{ }2.7183...\\right)\\\\ &\\sigma=\\text{[[Standard Deviation|Standard deviation]] of stock returns}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

Consider a company's [[Shares|shares]] sell for $210.59, [[Stock|stock]] price [[Volatility|volatility]] is 14.04%, the interest rate is 0.2175%, the strike price is $205, and the expiration time is four days. With the given values, the theoretical call option value produced by the model is -8.13.

## What Does the Merton Model Tell You?

[Loan officers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loanofficer.asp) and [[Stock|stock]] analysts utilize the Merton model to analyze a corporation's [[Risk|risk]] of credit [[Default|default]]. This model allows for easier valuation of the company and also helps analysts determine if the company [[Will|will]] be able to retain solvency by analyzing [[maturity dates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp) and [[Debt|debt]] totals.

The Merton (or Black-Scholes) model calculates the theoretical pricing of European put and [[call options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) without considering dividends paid out during the life of the option. The model can, however, be adapted to consider these dividends by calculating the [[ex-dividend date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp) value of [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stocks|stocks]].

The Merton Model makes the following basic assumptions:

-   All options are European and are exercised only at the time of expiration.
-   No dividends are paid out.
-   Market movements are unpredictable (efficient markets).
-   No commissions are included.
-   [[Underlying]] [[Stocks|stocks]]' [[Volatility|volatility]] and [[Risk|risk]]-free rates are constant.
-   Returns on [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stocks|stocks]] are regularly distributed.

Variables that were taken into consideration in the formula include options strike prices, present [[Underlying|underlying]] prices, [[Risk|risk]]-free interest rates, and the amount of time before expiration.

### Key Takeaways

-   In 1974, Robert Merton proposed a model for assessing the credit [[Risk|risk]] of a company by modeling the company's [[Equity|equity]] as a call option on its assets.
-   This method allows for the use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.
-   The Merton model provides a structural relationship between the [[Default Risk|default risk]] and the assets of a company.

## The Black-Scholes Model Versus the Merton Model

[Robert C. Merton](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/robert-c-merton.asp) was a famed American economist and Nobel Memorial Prize laureate, who befittingly purchased his first [[Stock|stock]] at age 10. Later, he earned a Bachelor in Science at Columbia University, a Masters of Science at California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech), and a doctorate in [[Economics|economics]] at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he later become a professor until 1988. At MIT, he developed and published groundbreaking and precedent-setting ideas to be utilized in the financial world.

Black and Scholes, during Merton’s time at MIT, developed a critical insight that by hedging an option, systematic [[Risk|risk]] is removed. Merton then developed a [[Derivative|derivative]] showing that hedging an option would remove all risk. In their 1973 paper, "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities," Black and Scholes included Merton's report, which explained the derivative of the formula. Merton later changed the name of the formula to the Black-Scholes model.
