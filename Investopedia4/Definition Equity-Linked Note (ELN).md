[[Definition Equity-Linked Note (ELN)]]
## What Is an [[Equity]]-Linked Note (ELN)?

An [[Equity|equity]]-linked note (ELN) is an investment product that combines a fixed-income investment with additional potential returns that are tied to the performance of equities. Equity-linked notes are usually structured to [[Return|return]] the initial investment with a variable interest portion that depends on the performance of the linked equity. ELNs can be structured in many different ways, but the vanilla version works like a [[strip bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stripbond.asp) combined with a [[call option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on a specific [[Security|security]], a basket of securities or an index like the S&P 500 or [[DJIA]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp). In the case of a note linked to an equity index, the security would typically be called an equity index-linked note.

## Understanding [[Equity]]-Linked Notes

[[Equity]]-linked notes provide a way for investors to protect their capital while also getting the potential for an above-average [[Return|return]] compared to regular bonds. In theory, the [[Upside|upside]] potential for returns in an equity-linked note is unlimited, whereas the downside [[Risk|risk]] is capped. Even in the worst-case scenario, most equity-linked notes [[Offer|offer]] full [[Principal|principal]] protection. That is what makes this type of a structured product appealing to [[risk-averse]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskaverse.asp) investors who nevertheless have a bullish outlook on the market. That said, equity-linked notes only pay on maturity, so there is an [[opportunity cost]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp) for locking in that money if only the principal is returned in the end.

## How ELN Work

In the simplest form, a $1,000 5-year [[Equity|equity]]-linked note could be structured to use $800 of the fund to buy a 5-year strip bond with a 4.5% [[Yield|yield]]-to-maturity and then invest and reinvest the other $200 in call options for the S&P 500 over the 5-year life of the note. There is a chance that the options [[Will|will]] expire worthless, in which case the investor gets back the $1,000 initially put in. If, however, the options appreciate in value with the S&P 500, those returns are added to the $1,000 that will eventually be returned to the investor.

## [[Equity]] Linked Note Caps, Participation Rates, and [[Leverage]]

In practice, an [[Equity|equity]]-linked note [[Will|will]] have a [[participation rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/participationrate.asp), which is the percentage amount that the investor in the note participates in the appreciation of the [[Underlying|underlying]] equity. If the participation rate is 100%, then a 5% increase in the underlying is a 5% increase for the eventual [[Payout|payout]] on the note. However, the cost of structuring the ELN and managing it can lower the participation rate. In the case of a 75% participation rate, for example, a 5% appreciation in the underlying is only worth 3.75% to the investor. 

[[Equity]]-linked notes can also use different structures and features. Some [[Will|will]] use an averaging formula to smooth out returns on the equity-linked portion or a periodic cap that limits the ELN’s [[Upside|upside]] by realizing returns at a particular level on a regular basis. There are also types of equity-linked notes that use dynamic hedging instead of options, deploying [[Leverage|leverage]] to increase returns from the [[Underlying|underlying]] equity. Overall, equity-linked notes can be a powerful tool for investors who want to protect their principle while still having the potential upside of an equity investment.
