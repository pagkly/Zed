[[What Regression Measures]]
## What Is Regression?

Regression is a statistical method used in [[Finance|finance]], investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by [[Y]]) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables).

Regression helps investment and financial managers to value assets and understand the relationships between variables, such as [[commodity prices]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp) and the [[Stocks|stocks]] of businesses dealing in those commodities.

## Regression Explained

The two basic types of regression are simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, although there are non-linear regression methods for more complicated data and analysis. Simple linear regression uses one independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of the dependent variable [[Y]], while multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome.

Regression can help [[Finance|finance]] and investment professionals as well as professionals in other businesses. Regression can also help predict sales for a company based on weather, previous sales, GDP growth, or other types of conditions. The [[capital asset pricing model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp) (CAPM) is an often-used regression model in finance for pricing assets and discovering costs of capital.

The general form of each type of regression is:

-   **Simple linear regression:** [[Y]] = a + bX + u
-   **Multiple linear regression:** [[Y]] = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3 + ... + btXt + u

Where:

-   [[Y]] = the variable that you are trying to predict (dependent variable).
-   X = the variable that you are using to predict [[Y]] (independent variable).
-   a = the intercept.
-   b = the slope.
-   u = the regression residual.

There are two basic types of regression: simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.

Regression takes a group of [[random variables]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/random-variable.asp), thought to be predicting [[Y]], and tries to find a mathematical relationship between them. This relationship is typically in the form of a straight line (linear regression) that best approximates all the individual data points. In multiple regression, the separate variables are differentiated by using subscripts.

### Key Takeaways

-   Regression helps investment and financial managers to value assets and understand the relationships between variables
-   Regression can help [[Finance|finance]] and investment professionals as well as professionals in other businesses. 

## A Real World Example of How Regression Analysis Is Used

Regression is often used to determine how many specific factors such as the price of a commodity, interest rates, particular industries, or sectors influence the price movement of an asset. The aforementioned CAPM is based on regression, and it is utilized to project the expected returns for [[Stocks|stocks]] and to generate costs of capital. A [[Stock|stock]]'s returns are regressed against the returns of a broader index, such as the S&P 500, to generate a beta for the particular stock.

Beta is the [[Stock|stock]]'s [[Risk|risk]] in relation to the market or index and is reflected as the slope in the CAPM model. The [[Return|return]] for the stock in question would be the dependent variable [[Y]], while the independent variable X would be the [[Market Risk Premium|market risk premium]].

Additional variables such as the [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] of a [[Stock|stock]], valuation ratios, and recent returns can be added to the CAPM model to get better estimates for returns. These additional factors are known as the Fama-French factors, named after the professors who developed the multiple linear regression model to better explain asset returns.1
