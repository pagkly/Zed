[[Market Portfolio]]
## What is a [[Market Portfolio]]?

A [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]] is a theoretical bundle of investments that includes every type of asset available in the investment universe, with each asset [[Weighted|weighted]] in proportion to its total presence in the market. The [[expected return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) of a market [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is identical to the expected [[Return|return]] of the market as a whole.

## The Basics of [[Market Portfolio]]

A [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]], by nature of being completely diversified, is subject only to [[systematic risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp), or [[Risk|risk]] that affects the market as a whole, and not to [[unsystematic risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsystematicrisk.asp), which is the risk inherent to a particular asset class.

As a simple example of a theoretical [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]], assume three companies exist in the [[Stock|stock]] market: Company A, Company B, and Company C. The market [[capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization.asp) of Company A is $2 billion, the [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] of Company B is $5 billion, and the market capitalization of Company C is $13 billion. Thus, the total market capitalization comes to $20 billion. The market [[Portfolio|portfolio]] consists of each of these companies, which are weighed in the portfolio as follows:

Company A [[Portfolio|portfolio]] weight = $2 billion / $20 billion = 10%

Company B [[Portfolio|portfolio]] weight = $5 billion / $20 billion = 25%

Company C [[Portfolio|portfolio]] weight = $13 billion / $20 billion = 65%

### key takeaways

-   A [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]] is a theoretical, diversified group of every type of investment in the world, with each asset [[Weighted|weighted]] in proportion to its total presence in the market.
-   Market portfolios are a key part of the capital asset pricing model, a commonly used foundation for choosing which investments to add to a diversified [[Portfolio|portfolio]].
-   Roll's Critique is an economic theory that suggests that it is impossible to create a truly diversified [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]]—and that the concept is a purely theoretical one.

## The [[Market Portfolio]] in the Capital Asset Pricing Model

The [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]] is an essential component of the [[capital asset pricing model (CAPM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp). Widely used for pricing assets, especially equities, the CAPM shows what an asset's expected [[Return|return]] should be based on its amount of systematic [[Risk|risk]]. The relationship between these two items is expressed in an equation called the [[security market line]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sml.asp). The equation for the [[Security|security]] market line is:

R\=Rf+βc(Rm−Rf)where: R\=Expected returnRf\=[[Risk]]-free rateβc\=Beta of asset in question versus the market portfolioRm\=Expected [[Return|return]] of the market [[Portfolio|portfolio]]\\begin{aligned} &R = R\_f + \\beta\_c ( R\_m - R\_f ) \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\ &R = \\text{Expected return} \\\\ &R\_f = \\text{Risk-free rate} \\\\ &\\beta\_c = \\text{Beta of asset in question versus the [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]]} \\\\ &R\_m = \\text{Expected return of the market portfolio} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

For example, if the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate is 3%, the expected [[Return|return]] of the [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]] is 10%, and the beta of the asset with respect to the market [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is 1.2, the expected return of the asset is:

Expected [[Return|return]] = 3% + 1.2 x (10% - 3%) = 3% + 8.4% = 11.4%

## Limitations of a [[Market Portfolio]]

Economist Richard Roll suggested in a 1977 paper that it is impossible to create a truly diversified [[Market Portfolio|market portfolio]] in practice—because this [[Portfolio|portfolio]] would need to contain a portion of every asset in the world, including collectibles, commodities, and basically any item that has marketable value. This argument, known as "[Roll's Critique,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rollscritique.asp)" suggests that even a broad-based market portfolio can only be an index at best and as such only approximate full [[Diversification|diversification]].

## Real World Example of a [[Market Portfolio]]

In a 2017 study, "[Historical Returns of the Market Portfolio](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2978509)," the economists Ronald Q. Doeswijk, Trevin Lam, and Laurens Swinkels attempted to document how a global multi-asset [[Portfolio|portfolio]] has performed over the period 1960 to 2017. They found that real compounded returns varied from 2.87% to 4.93%, depending on the currency used. In U.S. dollars, the [[Return|return]] was 4.45%.
