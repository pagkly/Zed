[[Nominal Yield Definition]]
## What is Nominal [[Yield]]?

A bond's nominal [[Yield|yield]], depicted as a percentage, is calculated by dividing all the annual interest payments by the face, or [[par]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp), value of the bond.

### Key Takeaways

-   A bond's nominal [[Yield|yield]], depicted as a percentage, is calculated by dividing all the annual interest payments by the face, or par, value of the bond.
-   Two components combine to determine the nominal [[Yield|yield]] on a [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]]: the prevailing rate of inflation and the credit [[Risk|risk]] of the issuer.
-   The nominal [[Yield|yield]] does not always represent the annual [[Return|return]] because it is a percentage based on the bond's par value and not the actual price that was paid for that bond.

## Understanding Nominal [[Yield]]

The nominal [[Yield|yield]] is the [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] on a bond. Essentially, it is the interest rate that the bond [[issuer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issuer.asp) promises to pay bond purchasers. This rate is fixed and it applies to the life of the bond. Sometimes it's also referred to as nominal rate or coupon yield.

The nominal [[Yield|yield]] does not always represent the annual [[Return|return]] because it's a percentage based on the bond's par value, and not the actual price that was paid to buy that bond. Buyers who pay a [[Premium|premium]] that's more than the face value for a given bond [[Will|will]] receive a lower actual [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) than the nominal yield, while investors who pay a discount that's less than the face value will receive a higher actual rate of return. It's also worth noting that bonds with high coupon rates tend to get called first—when callable—because they represent the issuer's greatest [[Liability|liability]] relative to bonds with lower yields.

For example, a bond with a face value of $1,000 that pays the bondholder $50 in interest payments annually would have a nominal [[Yield|yield]] of (50/1000) of 5%.

-   If the bondholder bought the bond for $1,000 then the nominal [[Yield|yield]] and the annual rate of [[Return|return]] are the same, 5%.
-   If the bondholder paid a [[Premium|premium]] and bought the bond at $1,050, then the nominal [[Yield|yield]] is still 5% but the annual rate of [[Return|return]] would be 4.76% (50/1050).
-   If the bondholder got the bond at a discount and paid $950 then the nominal [[Yield|yield]] is still 5% but the annual rate of [[Return|return]] would be 5.26% (50/950).

Bonds are issued by governments for domestic spending purposes or by corporations to raise funds for financing research and development, and [[capital expenditure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) (CAPEX). At the time of issuance, an investment banker acts as an intermediary between the bond issuer—which might be a corporation—and the bond buyer. Two components combine to determine the nominal [[Yield|yield]] on a [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]]: the prevailing rate of inflation and the credit [[Risk|risk]] of the issuer.

## Inflation and Nominal [[Yield]]

The nominal rate equals the perceived rate of inflation plus the real interest rate. At the time a bond is underwritten, the current rate of inflation is taken into consideration when establishing the [[Coupon Rate|coupon rate]] of a bond. Thus, higher annual rates of inflation push nominal [[Yield|yield]] upward. From 1979 until 1981, double-digit inflation loomed for three consecutive years. Consequently, three-month [[Treasury bills]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp) that were considered [[Risk|risk]]-free investments because of the backing of the U.S. Treasury peaked in the secondary market at a yield to maturity of 16.3% in December 1980. By contrast, the yield to maturity on the same three-month Treasury obligation is 1.5% in December 2019. As interest rates rise and fall, bond prices move inversely to rates, creating higher or lower nominal yields to maturity.

## Credit [[Rating]] and Nominal [[Yield]]

With U.S. government securities essentially representing [[Risk|risk]] free securities, [[corporate bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp) typically [[Hold|hold]] higher nominal yields by comparison. Corporations are assigned [[credit ratings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) by agencies such as Moody’s; their assigned value is based on the financial strength of the issuer. The difference in coupon rates between two bonds with identical maturities is known as the credit spread. Investment-grade bonds hold lower nominal yields at issuance than non-investment grade or high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds. Higher nominal yields come with a greater risk of [[Default|default]], a situation in which the corporate issuer is not able to make [[Principal|principal]] and interest payments on [[Debt|debt]] obligations. The investor accepts higher nominal yields with the knowledge that the issuer’s financial health poses a greater risk to principal.
