[[What the Total Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio Tells Us]]
## What Is the Total [[Debt]]-to-Capitalization Ratio?

The total [[debt-to-capitalization ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]]-to-capitalratio.asp) is a tool that measures the total amount of outstanding company [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtratio.asp) as a percentage of the firm’s total capitalization. The ratio is an indicator of the company's [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp), which is debt used to purchase assets.

Companies with higher [[Debt|debt]] must manage it carefully, ensuring enough [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] is on hand to manage [[Principal|principal]] and interest payments on debt. Higher debt as a percentage of total capital means a company has a higher [[Risk|risk]] of [[insolvency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insolvency.asp).

## The Formula for the Total [[Debt]]-to-Capitalization Ratio Is

Total [[Debt|debt]] to capitalization\=(SD+LTD)(SD+LTD+SE)where:SD\=short-term debtLTD\=long-term debtSE\=shareholders’ [[Equity|equity]]\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Total debt to capitalization} = \\frac{(SD + LTD)}{(SD + LTD + SE)} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &SD=\\text{short-term debt}\\\\ &LTD=\\text{long-term debt}\\\\ &SE=\\text{shareholders' equity}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

## What Does the Total [[Debt]]-to-Capitalization Ratio Tell You?

Every business uses assets to generate sales and profits, and capitalization refers to the amount of money raised to purchase assets. A business can raise money by issuing [[Debt|debt]] to creditors or by selling [[Stock|stock]] to shareholders. You can see the amount of capital raised as reported in the long-term debt and stockholders' [[equity accounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityaccounting.asp) on a company's balance sheet.

### Key Takeaways

-   The total [[Debt|debt]] to capitalization ratio is a solvency measure that shows the proportion of debt a company uses to [[Finance|finance]] its assets, relative to the amount of [[Equity|equity]] used for the same purpose.
-   A higher ratio result means that a company is more highly leveraged, which carries a higher [[Risk|risk]] of insolvency.

## Examples of the Total [[Debt]]-to-Capitalization Ratio in Use

Assume, for example, that company ABC has short-term [[Debt|debt]] of $10 million, long-term debt of $30 million and shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] of $60 million. The company's debt-to-capitalization ratio is calculated as follows:

**Total [[Debt|debt]]-to-capitalization ratio:**

($10 mill.+$30 mill.)($10 mill.+$30 mill.+$60 mill.)\=0.4\=40%\\frac{(\\$10 \\text{ mill.} + \\$30 \\text{ mill.})} {(\\$10 \\text{ mill.} + \\$30 \\text{ mill.} + \\$60 \\text{ mill.})} = 0.4 = 40\\%

This ratio indicates that 40% of the company’s [[capital structure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp) consists of [[Debt|debt]].

Consider the capital structure of another company, XYZ, which has short-term [[Debt|debt]] of $5 million, long-term debt of $20 million and shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] of $15 million. The firm’s debt-to-capitalization ratio would be computed as follows:

**Total [[Debt|debt]] to capitalization:**

($5 mill.+$20 mill.)($5 mill.+$20 mill.+$15 mill.)\=0.625\=62.5%\\frac{(\\$5 \\text{ mill.} + \\$20 \\text{ mill.})} {(\\$5 \\text{ mill.} + \\$20 \\text{ mill.} + \\$15 \\text{ mill.})} = 0.625 = 62.5\\%

Although XYZ has a lower dollar amount of total [[Debt|debt]] compared to ABC, $25 million versus $40 million, debt comprises a significantly larger part of its capital structure. In the event of an economic downturn, XYZ may have a difficult time making the interest payments on its debt, compared to firm ABC.

The [[acceptable level of total debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021215/what-good-[[Debt|debt]]-ratio-and-what-bad-debt-ratio.asp) for a company depends on the industry in which it operates. While companies in capital-intensive sectors such as utilities, pipelines, and telecommunications are typically highly leveraged, their cash flows have a greater degree of predictability than companies in other sectors that generate less consistent earnings.
