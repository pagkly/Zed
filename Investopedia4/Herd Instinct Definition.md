[[Herd Instinct Definition]]
## What is Herd Instinct?

Herd instinct in [[Finance|finance]] is the phenomenon where investors follow what they perceive other investors are doing, rather than their own analysis. In other words, an investor exhibiting herd instinct [[Will|will]] gravitate toward the same or similar investments based almost solely on the fact that many others are buying the securities.

## Understanding Herd Instinct

Herd instinct is a mentality that is distinguished by a lack of individual decision-making or introspection, causing people to think and behave in similar fashion to those around them. The fear of missing out on a profitable investment idea is often the driving force behind herd instinct.

### Key Takeaways

-   Herd instinct in [[Finance|finance]] is the phenomenon where investors follow what they perceive other investors are doing rather than their own analysis.
-   Herd instinct has a history of starting large, unfounded market rallies and sell-offs that are often based on a lack of fundamental support to justify either.
-   The dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s is a prime example of the ramifications of herd instinct in the growth and subsequent bursting of that industry's bubble.

Herd instinct, also known as herding, has a history of starting large, unfounded market rallies and sell-offs that are often based on a lack of fundamental support to justify either. Herd instinct is a significant driver of asset bubbles in financial markets. The [dotcom bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp) of the late 1990s and early 2000s is a prime example of the ramifications of herd instinct in the growth and subsequent bursting of that industry's bubble.

By nature, human beings want to be part of a community of people with shared cultured and socioeconomic norms. Nevertheless, people still cherish their individuality and taking responsibility for their own welfare. Investors can occasionally be induced into following the herd, whether through buying at the top of a market [[Rally|rally]] or jumping off the ship in a market [[sell-off]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sell-off.asp). [[Behavioral finance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp) theory attributes this conduct to the natural human tendency to be influenced by societal influences that trigger the fear of being alone or the fear of missing out. 

## Herding and Investment Bubbles

An investment [[bubble]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp) occurs when exuberant market behavior drives a rapid escalation in the price of an asset above and beyond its intrinsic value. The bubble continues to inflate until the asset price reaches a level beyond fundamental and economical rationality. At this stage in a bubble’s existence, further increases in the cost of the asset often are contingent purely on investors continuing to buy in at the highest price. When investors are no longer willing to buy at that [[Price Level|price level]], the bubble begins to collapse. In speculative markets, the burst can incite far-reaching corollary effects.

Some bubbles occur organically, driven by investors who are overcome with optimism about a [[Security|security]]’s price increase and a fear of being left behind as others realize significant gains. Speculators are drawn to invest, and thus cause the security price and trading volume to climb even higher. The [[irrational exuberance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irrationalexuberance.asp) over dotcom [[Stocks|stocks]] in the late 1990s was driven by cheap money, easy capital, market overconfidence, and overspeculation. It did not matter to investors that many dotcoms were generating no revenue, much less profits. The herding instincts of investors made them anxious to pursue the next [[initial public offering (IPO)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) while completely overlooking traditional [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] of investing. Just as the market peaked, investment capital began to dry up, which led to the bursting of the bubble and steep investment losses.
