[[Whichever Way a Stock Moves, A Strangle Can Squeeze Out a Profit]]
## What Is a Strangle?

A strangle is an options strategy in which the investor holds a position in both a [[call]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call.asp) and a [[put]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp) option with different [[strike prices]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp), but with the same expiration date and [[Underlying|underlying]] asset. A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying [[Security|security]] [[Will|will]] experience a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction. However, it is profitable mainly if the asset does swing sharply in price.

A strangle is similar to a [[straddle]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/straddle.asp) but uses options at different strike prices, while a straddle uses a call and put at the same strike price.

### Key Takeaways

-   A strangle is a popular options strategy that involves holding both a call and a put on the same [[Underlying|underlying]] asset.
-   A strangle covers investors who think an asset [[Will|will]] move dramatically but are unsure of the direction.
-   A strangle is profitable only if the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset does swing sharply in price.

## How Does a Strangle Work?

Strangles come in two forms:

1.  In a **long strangle**—the more common strategy—the investor simultaneously buys an [[out-of-the-money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp) call and an out-of-the-money put option. The call option's strike price is higher than the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset's current market price, while the put has a strike price that is lower than the asset's market price. This strategy has large profit potential since the call option has theoretically unlimited [[Upside|upside]] if the underlying asset rises in price, while the put option can profit if the underlying asset falls. The [[Risk|risk]] on the trade is limited to the [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp) paid for the two options.
2.  An investor doing a **short strangle** simultaneously sells an out-of-the-money put and an out-of-the-money call. This approach is a [[Neutral|neutral]] strategy with limited profit potential. A short strangle profits when the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] trades in a narrow range between the breakeven points. The maximum profit is equivalent to the net [[Premium|premium]] received for [[writing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp) the two options, less trading costs.

## Strangle vs. Straddle

Strangles and [[straddles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/straddle.asp) are similar options strategies that allow investors to profit from large moves to the [[Upside|upside]] or downside. However, a long straddle involves simultaneously buying [at the money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp) call and put options—where the [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) is identical to the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset's market price—rather than out-of-the-money options.

A short straddle is similar to a short strangle, with limited profit potential that is equivalent to the [[Premium|premium]] collected from writing the at the money call and put options.

With the straddle, the investor profits when the price of the [[Security|security]] rises or falls from the strike price just by an amount more than the total cost of the [[Premium|premium]]. So it doesn't require as large a price jump. Buying a strangle is generally less expensive than a straddle—but it carries greater [[Risk|risk]] because the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset needs to make a bigger move to generate a profit.

Pros

-   Benefits from asset's price move in either direction
    
-   Cheaper than other options strategies, like straddles
    
-   Unlimited profit potential
    

Cons

-   Requires big change in asset's price
    
-   May carry more [[Risk|risk]] than other strategies
    

## Real-World Example of a Strangle

To illustrate, let's say that Starbucks ([SBUX](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=sbux)) is currently trading at US$50 per share. To employ the strangle option strategy, a trader enters into two long option positions, one call and one put. The call has a strike of $52, and the [[Premium|premium]] is $3, for a total cost of $300 ($3 x 100 [[Shares|shares]]). The put option has a strike price of $48, and the premium is $2.85, for a total cost of $285 ($2.85 x 100 shares). Both options have the same [[expiration date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp).

If the price of the [[Stock|stock]] stays between $48 and $52 over the life of the option, the loss to the trader [[Will|will]] be $585, which is the total cost of the two option contracts ($300 + $285).

However, let's say Starbucks' [[Stock|stock]] experiences some [[Volatility|volatility]]. If the price of the [[Shares|shares]] ends up at $38, the call option [[Will|will]] expire worthlessly, with the $300 [[Premium|premium]] paid for that option lost. However, the put option has gained value, expiring at $1,000 and producing a net profit of $715 ($1,000 less the initial option cost of $285) for that option. Therefore, the total [[Gain|gain]] to the trader is $415 ($715 profit - $300 loss).

If the price rises to $57, the put option expires worthless and loses the [[Premium|premium]] paid for it of $285. The call option brings in a profit of $200 ($500 value - $300 cost). When the loss from the put option is factored in, the trade incurs a loss of $85 ($200 profit - $285) because the price move wasn't large enough to compensate for the cost of the options.

The operative concept is the move being big enough. If Starbucks had risen $12 in price, to $62 per share, the total [[Gain|gain]] would have again been $415 ($1000 value - $300 for call option [[Premium|premium]] - $285 for an expired put option).
