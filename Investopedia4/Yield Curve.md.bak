[[Yield Curve]]
## What Is a [[Yield Curve]]? 

A [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] is a line that plots yields (interest rates) of bonds having equal credit quality but differing [[maturity dates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp). The slope of the [[Yield|yield]] curve gives an idea of future interest rate changes and economic activity. There are three main types of yield curve shapes: normal (upward sloping curve), inverted (downward sloping curve) and flat.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Yield]] curves plot interest rates of bonds of equal credit and different maturities. 
-   The three key types of [[Yield|yield]] curves include normal, inverted and flat. Upward sloping (also known as normal yield curves) is where longer-term bonds have higher yields than short-term ones. 
-   While normal curves point to economic expansion, downward sloping (inverted) curves point to economic recession. 
-   [[Yield Curve|Yield curve]] rates are published on the Treasury’s website each trading day.

## How a [[Yield Curve]] Works

This [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] is used as a benchmark for other [[Debt|debt]] in the market, such as mortgage rates or bank lending rates, and it is used to predict changes in economic output and growth. The most frequently reported [[Yield|yield]] curve compares the three-month, two-year, five-year, 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury debt. [[Yield curve rates]](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield) are usually available at the Treasury's interest rate web sites by 6:00 p.m. ET each trading day.1

A [[Normal Yield Curve|normal yield curve]] is one in which longer maturity bonds have a higher [[Yield|yield]] compared to shorter-term bonds due to the risks associated with time. An [[inverted yield curve]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp) is one in which the shorter-term yields are higher than the longer-term yields, which can be a sign of an upcoming recession. In a flat or [[Humped Yield Curve|humped yield curve]], the shorter- and longer-term yields are very close to each other, which is also a predictor of an economic transition.

## Types of [[Yield Curve]]

### [[Normal Yield Curve]]

A normal or up-sloped [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] indicates yields on longer-term bonds may continue to rise, responding to periods of [[economic expansion]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expansion.asp). When investors expect longer-maturity bond yields to become even higher in the future, many would temporarily park their funds in shorter-term securities in hopes of purchasing longer-term bonds later for higher yields.

In a rising interest rate environment, it is risky to have investments tied up in longer-term bonds when their value has yet to decline as a result of higher yields over time. The increasing temporary demand for shorter-term securities pushes their yields even lower, setting in motion a steeper up-sloped [[Normal Yield Curve|normal yield curve]].

### Inverted [[Yield Curve]]

An inverted or down-sloped [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] suggests yields on longer-term bonds may continue to fall, corresponding to periods of economic recession. When investors expect longer-maturity bond yields to become even lower in the future, many would purchase longer-maturity bonds to lock in yields before they decrease further.

The increasing onset of demand for longer-maturity bonds and the lack of demand for shorter-term securities lead to higher prices but lower yields on longer-maturity bonds, and lower prices but higher yields on shorter-term securities, further inverting a down-sloped [[Yield Curve|yield curve]].

### [[Flat Yield Curve]]

A [[Flat Yield Curve|flat yield curve]] may arise from the normal or inverted [[Yield Curve|yield curve]], depending on changing [[Economic Conditions|economic conditions]]. When the economy is transitioning from expansion to slower development and even recession, yields on longer-maturity bonds tend to fall and yields on shorter-term securities likely rise, inverting a [[Normal Yield Curve|normal yield curve]] into a flat [[Yield|yield]] curve.

When the economy is transitioning from recession to recovery and potential expansion, yields on longer-maturity bonds are set to rise and yields on shorter-maturity securities are sure to fall, tilting an inverted [[Yield Curve|yield curve]] toward a [[Flat Yield Curve|flat yield curve]].
