[[Debt]]-To-[[Equity]] Ratio – D/E
## What Is the [[Debt]]-To-[[Equity]] Ratio (D/E)?

The [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] (D/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. These numbers are available on the balance sheet of a company’s financial statements.

The ratio is used to evaluate [[a company's financial leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-considered-good-net-debttoequity-ratio.asp). The D/E ratio is an important metric used in corporate [[Finance|finance]]. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through [[Debt|debt]] versus wholly-owned funds. More specifically, it reflects the ability of shareholder [[Equity|equity]] to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn.

The [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] ratio is a particular type of [[gearing ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gearingratio.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] (D/E) ratio compares a company’s total liabilities to its shareholder equity and can be used to evaluate how much [[Leverage|leverage]] a company is using.
-   Higher [[Leverage|leverage]] ratios tend to indicate a company or [[Stock|stock]] with higher [[Risk|risk]] to shareholders.
-   However, the D/E ratio is difficult to compare across industry groups where ideal amounts of [[Debt|debt]] [[Will|will]] vary.
-   Investors [[Will|will]] often modify the D/E ratio to focus on long-term [[Debt|debt]] only because the risks associated with long-term liabilities are different than for short-term debt and payables.

## D/E Ratio Formula and Calculation

[[Debt]]/[[Equity]]\=Total LiabilitiesTotal Shareholders’ Equity\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Debt/Equity} = \\frac{ \\text{Total Liabilities} }{ \\text{Total Shareholders' Equity} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}

The information needed for the D/E ratio is on a company's [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp). The balance sheet requires total shareholder [[Equity|equity]] to equal assets minus liabilities, which is a rearranged version of the balance sheet equation:

Assets\=Liabilities+Shareholder [[Equity]]\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Assets} = \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{Shareholder Equity} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

These balance sheet categories may contain individual accounts that would not normally be considered “[[Debt|debt]]” or “[[Equity|equity]]” in the traditional sense of a [[Loan|loan]] or the book value of an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]]/losses, intangible assets, and [[pension plan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp) adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand a company’s true [[Leverage|leverage]].

Because of the ambiguity of some of the accounts in the primary balance sheet categories, analysts and investors [[Will|will]] often modify the D/E ratio to be more useful and easier to compare between different [[Stocks|stocks]]. Analysis of the D/E ratio can also be improved by including short-term [[leverage ratios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverageratio.asp), profit performance, and growth expectations.

## Calculating the D/E Ratio in Excel

Business owners use a variety of software to track D/E ratios and other financial metrics. Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as D/E ratio and [[debt ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtratio.asp).1 However, even the amateur trader may want to calculate a company's D/E ratio when evaluating a potential investment opportunity, and it can be calculated without the aid of templates.

## Information From the [[Debt]]-To-[[Equity]] Ratio

Given that the [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] ratio measures a company’s debt relative to the value of its net assets, it is most often used to gauge the extent to which a company is taking on debt as a means of leveraging its assets. A high debt/equity ratio is often associated with high [[Risk|risk]]; it means that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt.

If a lot of [[Debt|debt]] is used to [[Finance|finance]] growth, a company could potentially generate more earnings than it would have without that financing. If [[Leverage|leverage]] increases earnings by a greater amount than the debt’s cost (interest), then shareholders should expect to benefit. However, if the cost of [[Debt Financing|debt financing]] outweighs the increased income generated, share values may decline. The [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]] can vary with market conditions. Thus, unprofitable borrowing may not be apparent at first.

Changes in [[long-term debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermdebt.asp) and assets tend to have the greatest impact on the D/E ratio because they tend to be larger accounts compared to [[short-term debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp) and short-term assets. If investors want to evaluate a company’s short-term [[Leverage|leverage]] and its ability to meet [[Debt|debt]] obligations that must be paid over a year or less, other ratios [[Will|will]] be used.

For example, an investor who needs to compare a company’s short-term [[Liquidity|liquidity]] or solvency [[Will|will]] use the [[cash ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-ratio.asp):

Cash Ratio\=Cash+Marketable SecuritiesShort-Term Liabilities \\begin{aligned} &\\text{Cash Ratio} = \\frac{ \\text{Cash} + \\text{[[Marketable Securities]]} }{ \\text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\\\ \\end{aligned}

or the [[current ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp):

Current Ratio\=Short-Term AssetsShort-Term Liabilities \\begin{aligned} &\\text{[[Current Ratio]]} = \\frac{ \\text{Short-Term Assets} }{ \\text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\\\ \\end{aligned}

instead of a long-term measure of [[Leverage|leverage]] like the D/E ratio.

## Modifications to [[Debt]]-To-[[Equity]] Ratio

The shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] portion of the balance sheet is equal to the total value of assets minus liabilities, but that isn’t the same thing as assets minus the [[Debt|debt]] associated with those assets. A common approach to resolving this issue is to modify the debt-to-equity ratio into the long-term debt-to-equity ratio. An approach like this helps an analyst focus on important risks.

Short-term [[Debt|debt]] is still part of the overall [[Leverage|leverage]] of a company, but because these liabilities [[Will|will]] be paid in a year or less, they aren’t as risky. For example, imagine a company with $1 million in short-term payables (wages, accounts payable, and notes, etc.) and $500,000 of long-term debt compared to a company with $500,000 in short-term payables and $1 million in long-term debt. If both companies have $1.5 million in shareholder [[Equity|equity]] then they both have a D/E ratio of 1.00. On the surface, the [[Risk|risk]] from leverage is identical, but in reality, the second company is riskier.

As a rule, short-term [[Debt|debt]] tends to be cheaper than long-term debt and it is less sensitive to shifting interest rates; the second company’s interest expense and [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] is higher. If interest rates fall, long-term debt [[Will|will]] need to be refinanced which can further increase costs. Rising interest rates would seem to favor the company with more long-term debt, but if the debt can be redeemed by bondholders it could still be a disadvantage.

## The D/E Ratio for Personal Finances

The [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] ratio can be applied to [[personal financial statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-financial-statement.asp) as well, in which case it is also known as the personal debt-to-equity ratio. Here, “equity” refers to the difference between the total value of an individual’s assets and the total value of his/her debt or liabilities. The formula for the personal D/E ratio is represented as:

[[Debt]]/[[Equity]]\=Total Personal LiabilitiesPersonal Assets−Liabilities\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Debt/Equity} = \\frac{ \\text{Total Personal Liabilities} }{ \\text{Personal Assets} - \\text{Liabilities} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}

The personal [[Debt|debt]]/[[Equity|equity]] ratio is often used when an individual or small business is applying for a [[Loan|loan]]. Lenders use the D/E to evaluate how likely it would be that the borrower is able to continue making loan payments if their income was temporarily disrupted.

For example, a prospective mortgage borrower is likely to be able to continue making payments if they have more assets than [[Debt|debt]] if they were to be out of a job for a few months. This is also true for an individual applying for a small business [[Loan|loan]] or line of credit. If the business owner has a good personal debt/[[Equity|equity]] ratio, it is more likely that they can continue making loan payments while their business is growing.

## D/E Ratio vs. the Gearing Ratio

Gearing ratios constitute a broad category of financial ratios, of which the [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] ratio is the best example. "Gearing" simply refers to financial [[Leverage|leverage]]. [[Gearing ratios]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121614/what-difference-between-gearing-ratio-and-debttoequity-ratio.asp) focus more heavily on the concept of leverage than other ratios used in accounting or investment analysis. This conceptual focus prevents gearing ratios from being precisely calculated or interpreted with uniformity. The [[Underlying|underlying]] principle generally assumes that some leverage is good, but too much places an organization at [[Risk|risk]].

At a fundamental level, gearing is sometimes differentiated from [[Leverage|leverage]]. Leverage refers to the amount of [[Debt|debt]] incurred for the purpose of investing and obtaining a higher [[Return|return]], while gearing refers to debt along with total [[Equity|equity]]—or an expression of the percentage of company funding through borrowing. This difference is embodied in the difference between the [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] and the debt-to-equity ratio.

The real use of [[Debt|debt]]/[[Equity|equity]] is comparing the ratio for firms in the same industry—if a company's ratio varies significantly from its competitors, that could raise a red flag.

## Limitations of [[Debt]]-To-[[Equity]] Ratio

When using the [[Debt|debt]]/[[Equity|equity]] ratio, it is very important to consider the industry within which the company exists. Because different industries have different capital needs and [[Growth Rates|growth rates]], a relatively high D/E ratio may be common in one industry, meanwhile, a relatively low D/E may be common in another. For example, capital-intensive industries such as auto [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] tend to have a debt/equity ratio of over 1, while tech firms could have a typical debt/equity ratio around 0.5.2

Utility [[Stocks|stocks]] often have a very high D/E ratio compared to market averages. A utility grows slowly but is usually able to maintain a steady income stream, which allows these companies to borrow very cheaply. High [[Leverage|leverage]] ratios in slow-growth industries with stable income represent an efficient use of capital. The [[consumer staples]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerstaples.asp) or consumer non-cyclical sector tends to also have a high [[Debt|debt]] to [[Equity|equity]] ratio because these companies can borrow cheaply and have a relatively stable income.2

Analysts are not always consistent about what is defined as [[Debt|debt]]. For example, [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] is sometimes considered [[Equity|equity]], but the preferred dividend, par value, and liquidation rights make this kind of equity look a lot more like debt. Including preferred [[Stock|stock]] in total debt [[Will|will]] increase the D/E ratio and make a company look riskier. Including preferred stock in the equity portion of the D/E ratio will increase the denominator and lower the ratio. It can be a big issue for companies like [[real estate investment trusts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) when preferred stock is included in the D/E ratio.

## Examples of the [[Debt]]-To-[[Equity]] Ratio

At the end of 2017, Apache Corp (APA) had total liabilities of $13.1 billion, total shareholder [[Equity|equity]] of $8.79 billion, and a [[Debt|debt]]/equity ratio of 1.49.3 ConocoPhillips (COP) had total liabilities of $42.56 billion, total shareholder equity of $30.8 billion, and a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.38 at the end of 2017:4

APA\=$13.1$8.79\=1.49\\begin{aligned} &\\text{APA} = \\frac{ \\$13.1 }{ \\$8.79 } = 1.49 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

COP\=$42.56$30.80\=1.38\\begin{aligned} &\\text{COP} = \\frac{ \\$42.56 }{ \\$30.80 } = 1.38 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

On the surface, it appears that APA’s higher [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]] indicates higher [[Risk|risk]]. However, this may be too generalized to be helpful at this stage and further investigation would be needed.

We can also see how reclassifying preferred [[Equity|equity]] can change the D/E ratio in the following example, where it is assumed a company has $500,000 in [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], $1 million in total [[Debt|debt]] (excluding preferred [[Stock|stock]]), and $1.2 million in total shareholder equity (excluding preferred stock).

The [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] ratio with [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] as part of total liabilities would be as follows:

[[Debt]]/[[Equity]]\=$1 million+$500,000$1.25 million\=1.25\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Debt/Equity} = \\frac{ \\$1 \\text{ million} + \\$500,000 }{ \\$1.25 \\text{ million} } = 1.25 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

The [[Debt|debt]]-to-[[Equity|equity]] ratio with [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] as part of shareholder equity would be:

[[Debt]]/[[Equity]]\=$1 million$1.25 million+$500,000\=.57\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Debt/Equity} = \\frac{ \\$1 \\text{ million} }{ \\$1.25 \\text{ million} + \\$500,000 } = .57 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Other financial accounts, such as [[Unearned Income|unearned income]], [[Will|will]] be classified as [[Debt|debt]] and can distort the D/E ratio. Imagine a company with a prepaid contract to construct a building for $1 million. The work is not complete, so the $1 million is considered a [[Liability|liability]].

Assume that the company has purchased $500,000 of inventory and materials to complete the job that has increased total assets and shareholder [[Equity|equity]]. If these amounts are included in the D/E calculation, the numerator [[Will|will]] be increased by $1 million and the denominator by $500,000, which will increase the ratio.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a good [[Debt|debt]] to [[Equity|equity]] ratio?

What counts as a “good” [[Debt|debt]] to [[Equity|equity]] ratio [[Will|will]] depend on the nature of the business and its industry. Generally speaking, a debt to equity ratio below 1.0 would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would be considered risky. Some industries, such as banking, are known for having much higher debt to equity ratios than others.

### What does a [[Debt|debt]] to [[Equity|equity]] ratio of 1.5 indicate?

A [[Debt|debt]] to [[Equity|equity]] ratio of 1.5 would indicate that the company in question has $1.5 of debt for every $1 of equity. To illustrate, suppose the company had assets of $2 million and liabilities of $1.2 million. Since equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, the company’s equity would be $800,000. Its debt to equity ratio would therefore be $1.2 million divided by $800,000, or 1.50.

### What does it mean for [[Debt|debt]] to [[Equity|equity]] to be negative?

If a company has a negative [[Debt|debt]] to [[Equity|equity]] ratio, this means that the company has negative shareholder equity. In other words, it means that the company has more liabilities than assets. In most cases, this is considered a very risky sign, indicating that the company may be at [[Risk|risk]] of bankruptcy. For instance, if the company in our earlier example had liabilities of $2.5 million, its debt to equity ratio would be -5.
