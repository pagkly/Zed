[[Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM) Definition]]
## What Is a Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM)?

A graduated payment mortgage (GPM) is a type of [fixed-rate mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-rate_mortgage.asp) in which the payments increase gradually from an initial low base level to a higher final level. Typically, the payments [[Will|will]] grow between 7-12 percent annually from their initial base payment amount until the full monthly payment amount is reached.

## How Graduated Payment Mortgages Work

A graduated payment mortgage is designed to start with the homeowner owing minimum payments. Then, over time, the payment amount increases. A low initial interest rate is used to qualify the buyer. This lower rate allows many, who might not otherwise qualify for a [[Home Mortgage|home mortgage]], to be eligible because they can afford the low initial payments. Had the note been written at a higher interest rate, these buyers may not have qualified due to the higher monthly payments. This type of mortgage payment system may be optimal for young or first-time homeowners as their income levels tend to rise gradually.

A graduated payment mortgage may or may not be a [[negative amortization loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negativelyamortizingloan.asp). If the initial payment amount is less than the accruing interest on the mortgage [[Loan|loan]], the graduated payment mortgage is a negative amortization loan. With a negative amortization loan, the payments made by the borrower are less than the interest charged on the note. This less than interest payment structure creates [[Deferred Interest|deferred interest]] which adds to the total [[Principal|principal]] of the loan.

Graduated payment mortgages are only available on loans from the [[Federal Housing Administration (FHA)]]. [FHA loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhaloan.asp) allow low-to-moderate income borrowers who are unable to make a large [down payment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down_payment.asp) [[Finance|finance]] up to 96.5% of the home's value.

### Key Takeaways

-   A graduated payment mortgage (GPM) is a type of [[Fixed-Rate Mortgage|fixed-rate mortgage]] with an amortization schedule that provides lower payments early on that increase over time.
-   The purpose of a GPM is to allow homeowners to start off with lower monthly mortgage payments to help certain people qualify for their [[Loan|loan]].
-   Total costs over the life of a GPM [[Loan|loan]] tend to be greater than a standard mortgage, and homeowners who were able to afford earlier payments may find themselves in financial trouble as monthly bills rise over time.

## Drawbacks of a Graduated Payment Mortgage

The primary disadvantage of a graduated payment mortgage is that the total costs associated with the mortgage are higher than with a traditional mortgage. As payments grow to higher interest rates, the borrower may find they are only paying the interest charges and not reducing the [[Principal|principal]] borrowed. 

Also, if the graduated payment mortgage is a negative amortization [[Loan|loan]], the borrower [[Will|will]] pay even more interest on the loan. As [[Deferred Interest|deferred interest]] adds to the [[Principal|principal]] borrowed, this value grows. In following month, interest calculations are on the more substantial amount.

Another major drawback which must bear consideration is with a graduated payment mortgage there is no guarantee that the borrower’s income [[Will|will]] increase in step with the increased mortgage payments. If the borrower’s income does not rise in ratio to the monthly [[Debt|debt]], they may [[Default|default]] on the [[Loan|loan]]. The default will further damage their credit, and the [[Lender|lender]] will foreclose on the property.

## Graduated Payment Mortgage vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgage

While a graduated payment mortgage may seem like a type of [[adjustable rate mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp) (ARM), it is not the same thing. 

An adjustable rate mortgage fluctuates periodically to reflect market interest rate. The ARM rate is adjusted periodically, but not on a fixed schedule. Also, the interest rate may decrease or climb due to its basis on the going market rate. Conversely, the interest rate on a graduated payment mortgage only goes up.
