[[Equity Fund]]
## What is an [[Equity Fund]]

An [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) fund is a mutual [[fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fund.asp) that invests principally in [[Stocks|stocks]]. It can be actively or passively (index fund) managed. Equity funds are also known as [[Stock|stock]] funds.

[[Stock]] [[mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/introduction-mutual-funds/) are principally categorized according to company size, the [[investment style]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investing_style.asp) of the [[holdings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Holdings|holdings]].asp) in the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] and geography.

## BREAKING DOWN [[Equity Fund]]

The size of an [[Equity Fund|equity fund]] is determined by a market [[capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization.asp), while the investment style, reflected in the fund's [[Stock|stock]] [[Holdings|holdings]], is also used to categorize [[Equity|equity]] mutual funds.

[[Equity]] funds are also categorized by whether they are domestic (U.S.) or international. These can be broad market, regional or [[single-country funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/countryfund.asp).

Some specialty [[Equity|equity]] funds target business [[sectors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector.asp), such as health care, commodities and [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp).

## Ideal Investment Vehicle

In many ways, [[Equity|equity]] funds are ideal [[investment vehicles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentvehicle.asp) for investors that are not as well-versed in financial investing or do not possess a large amount of capital with which to invest. Equity funds are practical investments for most people.

The attributes that make [[Equity|equity]] funds most suitable for small individual investors are the reduction of [[Risk|risk]] resulting from a fund's [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[diversification]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Diversification|diversification]].asp) and the relatively small amount of capital required to acquire [[Shares|shares]] of an [[Equity Fund|equity fund]]. A large amount of investment capital would be required for an individual investor to achieve a similar degree of risk reduction through diversification of a portfolio of direct [[Stock|stock]] [[Holdings|holdings]]. Pooling small investors' capital allows an equity fund to diversify effectively without burdening each investor with large [[capital requirements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalrequirement.asp).

The price of the [[Equity Fund|equity fund]] is based on the fund's [[net asset value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investing_style.asp) (NAV) less its liabilities. A more [[diversified fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversifiedfund.asp) means that there is less negative effect of an individual [[Stock|stock]]'s adverse price movement on the overall [[Portfolio|portfolio]] and on the [[share price]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/how-companys-share-price-determined.asp) of the [[Equity|equity]] fund.

[[Equity]] funds are managed by experienced professional [[portfolio managers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanager.asp), and their past performance is a matter of public record. [[Transparency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transparency.asp) and reporting requirements for equity funds are heavily regulated by the federal government.

## An [[Equity Fund]] for Everyone

Another great feature of [[Equity|equity]] funds is the sheer number of funds available. In the mutual fund arena as a whole, equity funds are the most popular type of mutual funds, and as of 2017, there were more than 9,350 mutual funds available in the market. Whether it’s a particular market sector (technology, financial, pharmaceutical), a specific [[Stock|stock]] exchange (such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) or [[Nasdaq]]), foreign or domestic markets, income or [[growth stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp), high or low [[Risk|risk]], or a specific interest group (political, religious, brand), there are equity funds of every type and characteristic available to match every [[risk profile]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-profile.asp) and [[investment objective]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentobjective.asp) that investors may have.

Some [[Equity|equity]] funds are also divided into those pursuing income or capital appreciation or both. Income funds seek [[Stocks|stocks]] that [[Will|will]] pay dividends, usually investing in equities of blue-chip companies. Other equity funds primarily seek capital appreciation, or the objective that the stocks in the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] will go up in share price.
