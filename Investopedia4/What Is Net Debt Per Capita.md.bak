[[What Is Net Debt Per Capita]]?
## [[What Is Net Debt Per Capita|What is Net Debt Per Capita]]?

The net [[Debt|debt]] [[per capita]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percapita.asp) is a measurement of the value of a government's debt expressed in terms of the amount attributable to each citizen under the government's jurisdiction. It is commonly computed using the following formula:

Net [[Debt]] Per Capita = (Short-Term Debt + Long-Term Debt – Cash & [[Cash Equivalents]])/Population

### Key Takeaways

-   Net [[Debt|debt]] per capita is simply a country or other jurisdiction's total debt divided by the population living there.
-   Net [[Debt|debt]] per capita can give an indication of how leveraged the government in question is.
-   Net [[Debt|debt]] per capita is often used to make a political statement about current [[Fiscal Policy|fiscal policy]] rather than as a true [[Economic Indicator|economic indicator]]. The debt to GDP ratio and other metrics often provide a more complete picture of a nation's actual economic health.

## Understanding Net [[Debt]] Per Capita

In simple terms, the net [[Debt|debt]] per capita is how much debt a government has per citizen. This is often calculated at the national level, but it also applies at the state and even municipal government levels. The level of net debt per capita can be an important factor to consider when analyzing a government's ability to continue to pay its [[Debt Service|debt service]] costs through its current levels of tax revenue. In other words, net debt per capita can be used to help evaluate the [[default risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp) of government bonds and give an indication of overall economic health.

## Calculating Net [[Debt]] Per Capita

Net [[Debt|debt]] per capita is a relatively simple calculation to perform. For example, if a country with a population of 300 million people has a total debt of $950 billion and cash of $20 billion, its net debt per capita is:

Net [[Debt]] Per Capita = ($950 Billion – $20 Billion)/300 Million = $3,100

Technically, this means that each [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] would owe the country $3,100 if the country were to pay off its national [[Debt|debt]]. This is assuming, of course, that every citizen became liable for the outstanding debt of the country, which doesn't happen in practice. In this sense, net debt per capita is simply an indicator by which to measure a country rather than an actual approximation of real individual [[Liability|liability]]. More importantly, net debt per capita figures can usually be obtained without having to gather the inputs and do the calculations, as many public sources and economic think tanks publish these figures.

## Significance of Net [[Debt]] Per Capita Figures

Net [[Debt|debt]] per capita is more commonly used for political statements than it is as an [[Economic Indicator|economic indicator]] in and of itself. Expressing the national debt in terms of a citizen's share makes a figure that is often too large to comprehend as a whole much more real to people. In a sense, the [[Liability|liability]] of every [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]], present, and future, rises as the national debt grows.

In 2016, for example, the net [[Debt|debt]] per capita of the United States was $61,539, almost twice what the average American [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] who [[filed as a single adult]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/single.asp) made that entire year. Other countries with high net debt per capita include Japan, Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Austria, France, Greece, the United Kingdom, and Portugal.

Again, these figures are generally used in domestic politics to push for some change in [[fiscal policy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp). That said, net [[Debt|debt]] per capita may be plotted against [[GDP per capita]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-capita-gdp.asp) to compare several regions around the world to determine the most promising area to invest in internationally. However, the [[debt to GDP ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtgdpratio.asp) is more commonly used for this purpose as it simplifies two data sets into a single plotted line for each country. This makes visualization and comparison much easier.
