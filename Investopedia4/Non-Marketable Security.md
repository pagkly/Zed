[[Non-Marketable Security]]
## What Is a [[Non-Marketable Security]]?

A [[Non-Marketable Security|non-marketable security]] is an asset that is difficult to buy or sell due to the fact that they are not traded on any major [[secondary market exchanges]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp). Such [[securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp), often forms of [[Debt|debt]] or fixed-income securities, are usually only bought and sold through private transactions or in an [[over-the-counter (OTC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) market.

For the holder of a [[Non-Marketable Security|non-marketable security]], finding a buyer can be difficult, and some non-[[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]] cannot be resold at all because government regulations prohibit any resale. A non-marketable [[Security|security]] may be contrasted with a [[marketable security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketablesecurities.asp), which is [[Listed|listed]] on an exchange and easily traded.

### Key Takeaways

-   In contrast, [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]] include [[Common Stock|common stock]], Treasury bills, and [[Money Market|money market]] instruments, among others.

## Non-[[Marketable Securities]] Explained

Most non-[[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]] are government-issued [[Debt|debt]] instruments. Common examples of nonmarketable securities include U.S. savings bonds, rural electrification certificates, private [[Shares|shares]], state and local government securities, and federal government series bonds. Non-marketable securities that are prohibited from being resold, such as [[U.S. savings bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ussavingsbonds.asp), are required to be held until maturity.

Limited partnership investments are an example of a private [[Security|security]] that may be nonmarketable due to the difficulty of reselling. Another example is private [[Shares|shares]] held by an owner of a company that is not publicly traded. The fact that these shares are non-marketable is not usually an obstacle for the owner unless they wish to relinquish ownership or control of the company.

The U.S. government issues both marketable and non-marketable [[Debt|debt]] securities. The most widely held [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]] include U.S. [[Treasury bills]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp) and Treasury bonds, both of which are freely traded in the U.S. bond market.

## The Rationale Behind Non-[[Marketable Securities]]

The primary reason that some [[Debt|debt]] securities are purposely issued as non-marketable is a perceived need to ensure stable ownership of the money the [[Security|security]] represents. Non-[[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]] are frequently sold at a discount to their face value and redeemable for face value at maturity. The [[Gain|gain]] for an investor is then the difference between the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of the security and its face value amount.

## Difference Between Marketable and Non-[[Marketable Securities]]

[[Marketable Securities|Marketable securities]] are those that are freely traded in a secondary market. The [[Principal|principal]] difference between marketable and nonmarketable securities revolves around the concepts of [[market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp) and intrinsic, or book, value. Marketable securities have both a marketable value, one which is subject to potentially volatile fluctuation in accordance with the changing levels of demand for the [[Security|security]] in the trading marketplace. Thus, marketable securities generally carry a higher level of [[Risk|risk]] than nonmarketable securities.

Non-[[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]], however, are not subject to the demand changes in a secondary trading market and, therefore, have only their [[intrinsic value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp), but no market value. The intrinsic value of a [[Non-Marketable Security|non-marketable security]], depending on the structure of the [[Security|security]], can be considered as either its face value, the amount payable upon maturity or its [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] plus interest.
