[[Portfolio Turnover]]
## What Is [[Portfolio Turnover]]?

[[Portfolio Turnover|Portfolio turnover]] is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers. [[Portfolio]] turnover is calculated by taking either the total amount of new securities purchased or the number of securities sold (whichever is less) over a particular period, divided by the total [[net asset value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp) (NAV) of the fund. The measurement is usually reported for a 12-month time period.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Portfolio Turnover|Portfolio turnover]] is a measure of how quickly securities in a fund are either bought or sold by the fund's managers, over a given period of time.
-   The rate of turnover is important for potential investors to consider, as funds that have a high rate [[Will|will]] also have higher fees, to reflect the turnover costs.
-   Funds that have a high rate usually incur capital gains taxes, which are then distributed to investors, who may have to pay taxes on those capital gains.
-   Growth mutual funds and any mutual funds that are actively managed tend to have a higher turnover rate than passive funds.
-   There are some scenarios in which the higher turnover rate translates to higher returns overall, therefore mitigating the impact of the additional fees.

## Understanding [[Portfolio Turnover]]

The [[Portfolio Turnover|portfolio turnover]] measurement should be [[considered by an investor]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051915/how-should-i-use-[[Portfolio|portfolio]]-turnover-evaluate-mutual-fund.asp) before deciding to purchase a given [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) or similar financial instrument. After all, a firm with a high turnover rate [[Will|will]] incur more [[transaction costs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transactioncosts.asp) than a fund with a lower rate. Unless the superior asset selection renders benefits that offset the added [[Transaction Costs|transaction costs]] they cause, a less [[active trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/active-trading.asp) posture may generate higher fund returns.

In addition, cost-conscious fund investors should take note that the transactional [[brokerage fee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerage-fee.asp) costs are not included in the calculation of a fund's [[operating expense ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-expense-ratio.asp) and thus represent what can be, in high-turnover portfolios, a significant additional expense that reduces investment [[Return|return]].

### 100%

The turnover rate a very actively-managed fund might generate, reflecting the fact that the fund's [[Holdings|holdings]] are 100% different from what they were a year ago.

## Managed Funds vs. Unmanaged Funds

The debate continues between advocates of unmanaged funds such as index funds and managed funds. A 2015 Morningstar study revealed that index funds outperformed large-company growth funds about 68% of the time in the 10-year period ending Dec. 31, 2014. Unmanaged funds traditionally have low [[Portfolio Turnover|portfolio turnover]]. Funds such as the $410.4 billion Vanguard 500 Index fund mirror the [[Holdings|holdings]] of the S&P 500 in which components infrequently are removed. The fund turns over at an annual rate of 3.1%, helping to keep [[expense ratios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp) low as the result of minimal trading and transaction fees.

While some investors avoid high-cost funds at all costs, by doing so, there exists the possibility that an individual may miss out on superior returns that consistently [[Outperform|outperform]] index funds. Seasoned fund managers that have consistently beat the [[benchmark]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) S&P 500 include 85-year old Ab Nicholas. The fund’s turnover rate averaged in the 19.47% range in the year ending Sept. 30, 2017. Despite increased buying and selling, the fund outpaced the S&P 500 in each year from 2008 through 2015.

[[Portfolio Turnover|Portfolio turnover]] is determined by taking what the fund has sold or bought—whichever number is higher—and dividing it by the fund's average monthly assets for the year.

## Taxes and Turnover

Portfolios that turn over at high rates generate large capital gains distributions. Investors focused on after-tax returns may be adversely affected by taxes levied against realized gains. Consider an investor that continually pays an annual tax rate of 30% on distributions made from a mutual fund earning 10% per year. The individual is foregoing investment dollars that could be retained from participation in low transactional funds with a low turnover rate. An investor in an unmanaged fund that sees an identical 10% annual [[Return|return]] does so largely from unrealized appreciation.

Index funds should not have a [[turnover rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021616/what-good-turnover-ratio-mutual-fund.asp) of higher than 20% to 30% since securities should only be added or removed from the fund when the [[Underlying|underlying]] index makes a change in its [[Holdings|holdings]]; a rate higher than 30% suggests the fund is poorly managed.

## Example of [[Portfolio Turnover]]

If a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] begins one year at $10,000 and ends the year at $12,000, determine the average monthly assets by adding the two together and dividing by two to get $11,000. Next, assume the various purchases totaled $1,000 and the various sales totaled $500. Finally, divide the smaller amount—buys or sales—by the average amount of the portfolio. For this example, the sales represent a smaller amount. Therefore, divide the $500 sales amount by $11,000 to get the [[Portfolio Turnover|portfolio turnover]]. In this case, the portfolio turnover is 4.54%.
