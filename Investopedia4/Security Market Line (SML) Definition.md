[[Security Market Line (SML) Definition]]
## What Is the [[Security]] Market Line?

The [[Security|security]] market line (SML) is a line drawn on a chart that serves as a graphical representation of the [[capital asset pricing model (CAPM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp)—which shows different levels of systematic, or market [[Risk|risk]], of various [[marketable securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketablesecurities.asp), plotted against the [[expected return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) of the entire market at any given time.

Also known as the "characteristic line," the SML is a visualization of the CAPM, where the x-axis of the chart represents [[Risk|risk]] (in terms of [[beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp)), and the [[Y|y]]-axis of the chart represents expected [[Return|return]]. The [[market risk premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketriskpremium.asp) of a given [[Security|security]] is determined by where it is plotted on the chart relative to the SML.

## Understanding the [[Security]] Market Line

The [[Security|security]] market line is an investment evaluation tool derived from the CAPM—a model that describes [[risk-return relationship]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp) for securities—and is based on the assumption that investors need to be compensated for both the [[time value of money (TVM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) and the corresponding level of [[Risk|risk]] associated with any investment, referred to as the [[risk premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Security|security]] market line (SML) is a line drawn on a chart that serves as a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). 
-   The SML can help to determine whether an investment product would [[Offer|offer]] a favorable expected [[Return|return]] compared to its level of [[Risk|risk]].
-   The formula for plotting the SML is _required [[Return|return]] = [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of return + beta (market return - risk-free rate of return)_.

The concept of beta is central to the CAPM and the SML. The beta of a [[Security|security]] is a measure of its [[systematic risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp), which cannot be eliminated by [[Diversification|diversification]]. A beta value of one is considered as the overall market average. A beta value that's greater than one represents a [[Risk|risk]] level greater than the market average, and a beta value of less than one represents a risk level that is less than the market average.

The formula for plotting the SML is:

-   **Required [[Return|return]]** = [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of return + beta (market return - risk-free rate of return)

Although the SML can be a valuable tool for evaluating and comparing securities, it should not be used in isolation, as the expected [[Return|return]] of an investment over the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of return is not the only thing to consider when choosing investments.

## Using the [[Security]] Market Line

The [[Security|security]] market line is commonly used by money managers and investors to evaluate an investment product that they're thinking of including in a [[portfolio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp). The SML is useful in determining whether the security offers a favorable expected [[Return|return]] compared to its level of [[Risk|risk]].

When a [[Security|security]] is plotted on the SML chart, if it appears above the SML, it is considered [[undervalued]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp) because the position on the chart indicates that the security offers a greater [[Return|return]] against its [[inherent risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inherent-[[Risk|risk]].asp).

Conversely, if the [[Security|security]] plots below the SML, it is considered overvalued in price because the expected [[Return|return]] does not overcome the inherent [[Risk|risk]].

The SML is frequently used in comparing two similar securities that [[Offer|offer]] approximately the same [[Return|return]], in order to determine which of them involves the least amount of inherent market [[Risk|risk]] relative to the expected return. The SML can also be used to compare securities of equal risk to see which one offers the highest expected return against that level of risk.
