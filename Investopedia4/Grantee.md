[[Grantee]]
## What Is a [[Grantee]]?

A [[Grantee|grantee]] is the recipient of a [[grant]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/[[Grant|grant]].asp), scholarship, or some other asset such as real [[Estate|estate]] property. In contrast, a grantor is a person or entity that conveys ownership of an asset to another person or entity: the grantee. Identifying the grantee and grantor is especially important in legal documents as specific duties, responsibilities, benefits, and limitations are assigned to each.

## Understanding Grantees

A [[Grantee|grantee]] is the recipient of something granted or given. The term can be used in different contexts and across different industries and institutions. In real [[Estate|estate]], the grantee takes title to the purchased property. In academia, a grantee is the recipient of a scholarship or [[Grant|grant]]. In the investment industry, a grantee can be the recipient of [[Stock|stock]] options.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Grantee|grantee]] is the recipient of something, such as a college [[Grant|grant]] or real [[Estate|estate]] property.
-   A grantor is a person or entity that transfers to another person or entity the interest or ownership rights to an asset.
-   Legal documents, such as deeds, detail the transfer of assets between grantors and grantees.
-   The type of legal document determines what limitations are placed on rights and interests transferred to a [[Grantee|grantee]].

The grantor and [[Grantee|grantee]] are named in legal documents, such as deeds, which transfer from one party to another the interests or rights to an asset. However, what exactly is being transferred can differ depending on the type of legal document. For example, in real [[Estate|estate]], a [[quitclaim deed]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quitclaimdeed.asp) provides no warranty regarding the status of the property's title to the grantee. This type of deed can render the grantee powerless should there be title defects whereby no interest in the property is transferred to the grantee. These types of deeds are uncommon between parties with no existing relationship.

Special warranty deeds assure the [[Grantee|grantee]] that the grantor owns the asset, such as real [[Estate|estate]] property, and had no issues with the title during their ownership. The [[Special Warranty Deed|special warranty deed]] does not provide any guarantees about the title before the grantor's ownership.

[General warranty deeds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warranty-deed.asp) include warranties and covenants, [[Offering|offering]] grantees the most protection. With this deed, the [[Grantee|grantee]] receives a warranty that the title is without title defects, such as encumbrances. It is not limited to issues that arose during the seller's ownership.

## Special Considerations

A county grantor-[[Grantee|grantee]] index provides a record of real [[Estate|estate]] transfers showing who released ownership of a property and who took ownership. The index also shows the property's legal description, its location, and the type of document used to transfer ownership (e.g., [[Quitclaim Deed|quitclaim deed]], trust deed, or tax [[Lien|lien]]). Typically, the index is maintained by the county recorder.

## [[Grantee]] Example

The parties in a [[Debt|debt]] [[Lien|lien]] are also known as grantors and grantees. The most common of these include mechanic's liens, tax liens, and judgment liens. In a financed automobile arrangement, the car's owner (grantor) transfers their interest in the vehicle to the [[Lender|lender]] ([[Grantee|grantee]]). The grantee has an interest in the asset until the [[Loan|loan]] is satisfied by the grantor. If the grantor breaches the contract, the grantee may take possession of the asset.
