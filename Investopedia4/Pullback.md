[[Pullback]]
## What is a [[Pullback]]?

A [[Pullback|pullback]] is a pause or moderate drop in a [[Stock|stock]] or commodities pricing chart from recent peaks that occur within a continuing uptrend. A pullback is very similar to [retracement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Retracement|retracement]].asp) or [consolidation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp), and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The term pullback is usually applied to pricing drops that are relatively short in duration - for example, a few consecutive sessions - before the uptrend resumes.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Pullback|pullback]] is a temporary [[Reversal|reversal]] in the [[Price Action|price action]] of an asset or [[Security|security]].
-   The duration of a [[Pullback|pullback]] is usually only a few consecutive sessions. A longer pause before the uptrend resumes is generally referred to as consolidation.
-   Pullbacks can provide an entry point for traders looking to enter a position when other technical indicators remain bullish.

## What Does a [[Pullback]] Tell You?

Pullbacks are widely seen as buying opportunities after a [[Security|security]] has experienced a large upward price movement. For example, a [[Stock|stock]] may experience a significant rise following a positive earnings announcement and then experience a [[Pullback|pullback]] as traders with existing positions take the profit off the table. The positive earnings, however, are a fundamental signal that suggests that the stock [[Will|will]] resume its uptrend.

Most pullbacks involve a [[Security|security]]’s price moving to an area of technical support, such as a [[moving average]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) or [[pivot point]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pivotpoint.asp), before resuming their uptrend. [[Traders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]]-trader.asp) should carefully watch these key areas of support since a breakdown from them could signal a [reversal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Reversal|reversal]].asp) rather than a [[Pullback|pullback]].

## Example of How to Use a [[Pullback]]

Pullbacks typically don’t change the [[Underlying|underlying]] fundamental narrative that is driving the [[Price Action|price action]] on a chart. They are usually profit-taking opportunities following a strong run-up in a [[Security|security]]’s price. For example, a company may report blow-out earnings and see [[Shares|shares]] jump 20%. The [[Stock|stock]] may experience a [[pullback]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Pullback|pullback]].asp) the next day as short-term traders lock in profits. However, the strong earnings report suggests that the business underlying the stock is doing something right. Buy and [[Hold|hold]] traders and investors [[Will|will]] likely be attracted to the stock by the strong earnings reports, supporting a sustained uptrend in the near-term.

Every [[Stock|stock]] chart has examples of pullbacks within the context of a prolonged uptrend. While these pullbacks are easy to spot in retrospect, they can be harder to assess for investors holding a [[Security|security]] that’s losing value.

In the example above, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) experiences four pullbacks within the context of a prolonged trend higher. These pullbacks typically involved a move to near the 50-day moving average where there was technical support before a rebound higher. Traders should be sure to use several different technical indicators when assessing pullbacks to ensure that they don’t turn into longer-term reversals.

## The Difference Between a [[Reversal]] and a [[Pullback]]

Pullbacks and reversals both involve a [[Security|security]] moving off its highs, but pullbacks are temporary and reversals are longer term. So how can traders distinguish between the two? Most reversals involve some change in a security’s [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] that force the market to reevaluate its value. For example, a company may report disastrous earnings that make investors recalculate a [[Stock|stock]]’s net present value. Similarly, it could be a negative settlement, a new competitor releasing a product or some other event that [[Will|will]] have a long-term impact on the company underlying the stock.

These events, while happening outside of the chart, so to speak, [[Will|will]] appear over several sessions and initially will seem much like a [[Pullback|pullback]]. For this reason, traders use moving averages, trendlines and trading bands to flag when a pullback keeps going and is at [[Risk|risk]] of entering [[Reversal|reversal]] territory.

## Limitations in Trading Pullbacks

The biggest limitation of trading pullbacks is that a [[Pullback|pullback]] could be the start of a true [[Reversal|reversal]]. Being that both pullbacks and reversals happen on a range of timeframes, including intraday if you want to go granular, one trader's multi-session pullback is actually a reversal for a day trader looking at the same chart. If the [[Price Action|price action]] breaks the trendline for your timeframe, then you may be looking at a reversal rather than a pullback.

In this case, it is not the time to enter a bullish position. Of course, adding other technical indicators and fundamental data scans to the mix [[Will|will]] increase a trader's confidence in identifying pullbacks from true reversals.
