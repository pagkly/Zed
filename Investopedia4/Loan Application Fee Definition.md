[[Loan Application Fee Definition]]
## What Is a [[Loan]] Application Fee?

A [[Loan|loan]] application fee is charged to a potential borrower for processing and underwriting an application for a [[loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp), such as a mortgage or car loan. Loan application fees may be required for all types of loans and are intended to pay for the costs of the process of loan approval, but are considered by many observers to be unnecessary or overly costly.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Loan|loan]] application fee is an up-front, usually nonrefundable charge for submitting a loan application such as for a mortgage.
-   Some critics argue that application fees are unnecessary "garbage fees" that line the pockets of lenders and increase closing costs.
-   Comparing fees can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars, and you may even avoid paying an application fee to some lenders.

## Understanding [[Loan]] Application Fees

A [[Loan|loan]] application fee is one type of fee borrowers may be charged for obtaining a loan. Different from other types of loan fees, the loan application fee is an up-front, usually nonrefundable, charge that borrowers are required to pay when they submit a loan application. Loan application fees [[Will|will]] vary by [[Lender|lender]], and many lenders will not charge a loan application fee at all.

Because most [[Loan|loan]] application fees are nonrefundable, they present a high [[Risk|risk]] for low-credit-quality borrowers. Therefore, borrowers should first do due diligence on their own [[Credit Score|credit score]] and the standard approval requirements for the type of loan they wish to obtain in order to ensure that the application fee [[Will|will]] not be lost with a credit application rejection.

Borrowers should also seek to compare application fees across lenders. [[Loan]] application fees can vary significantly among different types of lenders, ranging on a mortgage loan anywhere from $0 to $500. Thus, researching loan options and application fees with various competitors can potentially result in hundreds of dollars saved. Some lenders may also be willing to waive the application fee through negotiation or comparison to other competitor market fees.

## Special Considerations

Online lenders generally require the lowest application fee, thanks to automated processing that does not require some of the added expenses associated with traditional and in-person [[Loan|loan]] consultations. Loan application fees are typically most common in a [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) loan, which includes many ad hoc fees in addition to the monthly interest. Working with a [[Mortgage Broker|mortgage broker]] can increase the likelihood of a loan application fee because the broker works as an intermediary on behalf of both the borrower and the [[Lender|lender]].

## Types of [[Loan]] Fees

[[Loan]] application fees are just one type of fee lenders can charge on a loan. Other fees may include an [[origination fee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/origination-fee.asp) and monthly service fees. In general, fees help a [[Lender|lender]] cover costs associated with underwriting and processing a loan.

In the credit market, mortgage loans tend to have the broadest fee requirements. [[Mortgage lenders]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-guide/mortgage-lenders/) may charge origination fees, appraisal fees, and administration fees. In some cases, a mortgage [[Lender|lender]] may bundle its fees by charging a closing points fee, which is a comprehensive fee calculated as a percentage of the [[Principal|principal]] balance.

The [[Loan|loan]] application fee is sometimes considered to be a garbage, or junk fee, which are often unnecessary charges and fees that are tacked onto mortgage [closing costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingcosts.asp) by lenders. Lenders do this to increase their own profit on the loan. There are a number of ways that lenders manage to fold [[garbage fees]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junk-fees.asp) into closing costs.
