[[What Is the Definition of a Fractional Share]]?
## What Is a Fractional Share?

Less than one full share of [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) is called a fractional share. Such [[Shares|shares]] may be the result of [[Stock|stock]] splits, dividend [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] plans (DRIPs), or similar corporate actions. Typically, fractional shares aren't available from the stock market, and while they have value to investors, they are also difficult to sell.

### Key Takeaways

-   A fractional share is a portion of an [[Equity|equity]] [[Stock|stock]] that is less than one full share.
-   Fractional [[Shares|shares]] often result from [[Stock|stock]] splits, which don't always result in an even number of shares.
-   Mergers or acquisitions create fractional [[Shares|shares]], as companies combine new [[Common Stock|common stock]] using a predetermined ratio.
-   Capital gains, dollar-cost averaging, and dividend [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] plans often leave the investor with fractional [[Shares|shares]].
-   Fractional [[Shares|shares]] don't trade on the open market; the only way to sell fractional shares is through a major brokerage.

## Understanding a Fractional Share

Fractional [[Shares|shares]] come about in a number of ways, including dividend [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] plans, [[Stock|stock]] splits, mergers, and acquisitions.

### Dividend [[Reinvestment]] Plans

[Dividend [[Reinvestment|reinvestment]] plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp) (DRIP) often create fractional [[Shares|shares]]. A dividend reinvestment plan is a plan in which a dividend-[[Offering|offering]] corporation or brokerage firm allows investors to use dividend [payouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Payout|payout]].asp) to purchase more of the same shares. As this amount "drips" back into the purchase of more shares, it is not limited to whole shares. Reinvesting capital [[Gain|gain]] distributions and dollar-cost averaging programs can also result in purchasing fractional shares.

### [[Stock]] Splits

[Stock splits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksplit.asp) don't always result in an even number of [[Shares|shares]]. A 3-for-2 [[Stock Split|stock split]] would create three shares for every two shares an investor owns, so an investor with an odd number of shares would end up with a fractional share after the split. Three shares would become 4½, five would become 7½, and so on.

### Mergers and Acquisitions

[Mergers and acquisitions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) (M&As) may also create fractional [[Shares|shares]] since companies combine new [[Common Stock|common stock]] using a predetermined ratio. The ratio often results in fractional shares for shareholders.

Some brokerage firms [[Will|will]] split whole [[Shares|shares]] intentionally so they can sell fractional shares to clients. This division of shares is most often the case with high-priced [[Stocks|stocks]] like Amazon ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn)) or Alphabet, Google's parent company ([GOOGL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=googl)). As of March 2020, AMZN was selling for more than $1,800 per share, and GOOGL was selling for more than $1,100 per share.12 Fractional shares often can be the only way individual investors can buy [[Stock|stock]] in  
such companies.

For example, a young investor with limited funds might have their heart set on buying [[Stock|stock]] in Amazon. Starting with $1,000 to invest, they won't have enough to buy a full share of stock, so they might find a brokerage firm willing to sell a fractional share. They could invest half of the money in one-third of a share of Amazon and use the other half to invest in lower-priced [[Stocks|stocks]] that would allow them to buy full [[Shares|shares]].

In the event of [[Stocks|stocks]] splits, mergers, and acquisitions, shareholders sometimes are given the option of obtaining cash in lieu of the fractional [[Shares|shares]]. The income received is taxable.

## Trading Fractional [[Shares]]

The only way to sell fractional [[Shares|shares]] is through a major brokerage firm, which can join them with other fractional shares until a whole share is attained. If the selling [[Stock|stock]] does not have a high demand in the marketplace, selling the fractional shares might take longer than hoped.

Not everyone wants to [[Hold|hold]] onto fractional [[Shares|shares]], especially if they ended up with them for inadvertent reasons such as [[Stock|stock]] splits. An investor might have 225 shares of XYZ stock priced at $12 per share. After a 3-for-2 [[Stock Split|stock split]], they would end up with 337½ shares priced at $8 per share. If there is a high demand for XYZ stock in the market, they'll be more likely to find a brokerage firm willing to take the fractional share. Or they could find a brokerage firm willing to sell another half share to bring their total number of shares to 338.

## Real-World Example of a Fractional Share

In November of 2019, [[Interactive Brokers]](https://www.investopedia.com/interactive-brokers-review-4587904) became the first of the major online brokers to [[Offer|offer]] fractional [[Shares|shares]] trading.3 On January 29, 2020, [[Fidelity]](https://www.investopedia.com/fidelity-review-4587897) announced it [[Will|will]] offer fractional shares trading of equities and ETFs.4
