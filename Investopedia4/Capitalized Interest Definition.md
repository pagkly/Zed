[[Capitalized Interest Definition]]
## What Is Capitalized Interest?

Capitalized interest is the cost of borrowing to acquire or construct a long-term asset. Unlike an interest expense incurred for any other purpose, capitalized interest is not expensed immediately on the [[income statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp) of a company's financial statements. Instead, firms capitalize it, meaning the interest paid increases the [[cost basis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp) of the related long-term asset on the [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp). Capitalized interest shows up in installments on a company's income statement through periodic [[depreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) expense recorded on the associated long-term asset over its [[Useful Life|useful life]].

## Understanding Capitalized Interest

Capitalized interest is part of the [[historical cost]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historical-cost.asp) of acquiring assets that [[Will|will]] benefit a company over many years. Because many companies [[Finance|finance]] the construction of long-term assets with [[Debt|debt]], [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) (GAAP) allow firms to avoid expensing interest on such debt and [[include it on their balance sheets]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062714/whats-difference-between-[[Weighted|weighted]]-average-cost-capital-wacc-and-internal-rate-[[Return|return]]-irr.asp) as part of the historical cost of long-term assets.

Typical examples of long-term assets for which capitalizing interest is allowed include various production facilities, real [[Estate|estate]], and ships. Capitalizing interest is not permitted for inventories that are manufactured repetitively in large quantities. U.S. tax laws also allow the capitalization of interest, which provides a [[tax deduction]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-deduction.asp) in future years through a periodic depreciation expense.

### Key Takeaways

-   Capitalized interest is the cost of borrowing to acquire or construct a long-term asset.
-   Unlike typical interest expenses, capitalized interest is not expensed immediately on a company's income statement.
-   Because many companies [[Finance|finance]] long-term assets with [[Debt|debt]], companies are allowed to expense the assets over the long-term.
-   By capitalizing the interest expense, companies are able to generate revenue from the asset in order to pay for it over time.

From the perspective of [[accrual accounting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrualaccounting.asp), capitalizing interest helps tie the costs of using a long-term asset to [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) generated by the asset in the same periods of use. Capitalized interest can only be booked if its impact on a company's financial statements is material. Otherwise, interest capitalization is not required, and it should be expensed immediately. When booked, capitalized interest has no immediate effect on a company's income statement, and instead, it appears on the income statement in subsequent periods through depreciation expense.

### Important

In accordance with the matching principle, capitalizing interest ties the costs of a long-term asset to the earnings generated by the same asset over its [[Useful Life|useful life]].

## Example of Capitalized Interest

Consider a company that builds a small production facility worth $5 million with a [[Useful Life|useful life]] of 20 years. It borrows the amount to [[Finance|finance]] this project at an interest rate of 10%. The project [[Will|will]] take a year to complete to put the building to its intended use, and the company is allowed to [[capitalize]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalize.asp) its annual interest expense on this project, which amounts to $500,000.

The company capitalizes interest by recording a debit entry of $500,000 to a [[fixed asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp) account and an offsetting credit entry to cash. At the end of construction, the company's production facility has a book value of $5.5 million, consisting of $5 million in construction costs and $500,000 in capitalized interest.

In the next year, when the production facility is used, the company books a straight-line depreciation expense of $275,000 ($5.5 million of the facility's book value divided by 20 years of [[Useful Life|useful life]]) of which $25,000, ($500,000 of capitalized interest divided by 20 years), is attributable to the capitalized interest.
