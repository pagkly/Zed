[[Risk-Weighted Assets Definition]]
## What Are [[Risk]]-[[Weighted]] Assets?

[[Risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets are used to determine the minimum amount of capital that must be held by banks and other financial institutions in order to reduce the risk of [[insolvency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insolvency.asp). The [[capital requirement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalrequirement.asp) is based on a [[risk assessment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-assessment.asp) for each type of bank asset.

For example, a [[Loan|loan]] that is secured by a [[letter of credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofcredit.asp) is considered to be riskier and thus requires more capital than a mortgage loan that is secured with [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   Basel III, a set of international banking regulations, sets the guidelines around [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets.
-   [[Risk]] coefficients are determined based on the credit ratings of certain types of bank assets.
-   Loans backed with [[Collateral|collateral]] are considered to be less risky than others because the collateral is considered in addition to the source of repayment when calculating an asset's [[Risk|risk]].

## Understanding [[Risk]]-[[Weighted]] Assets

The [[financial crisis of 2007 and 2008]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/09/financial-crisis-review.asp) was driven by financial institutions investing in [[subprime]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime.asp) [[Home Mortgage|home mortgage]] loans that had a far higher [[Risk|risk]] of [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) than bank managers and regulators believed to be possible. When consumers started to [[Default|default]] on their mortgages, many financial institutions lost large amounts of capital, and some became insolvent.

Basel III, a set of international banking regulations, set forth certain guidelines to avoid this problem moving forward. Regulators now insist that each bank must group its assets together by [[Risk|risk]] category so that the amount of required capital is matched with the risk level of each asset type. Basel III uses credit ratings of certain assets to establish their risk coefficients. The goal is to prevent banks from losing large amounts of capital when a particular [[asset class]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) declines sharply in value.

There are many ways [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets are used to [[calculate the solvency ratio of banks]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052515/how-are-risk-weighted-assets-used-calculate-solvency-ratio-regulatory-capital-basel-iii.asp).

Bankers have to balance the potential rate of [[Return|return]] on an asset category with the amount of capital they must maintain for the asset class.

## How to Assess Asset [[Risk]]

Regulators consider several tools to assess the [[Risk|risk]] of a particular asset category. Since a large percentage of bank assets are loans, regulators consider both the source of [[Loan|loan]] [[repayment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp) and the [[Underlying|underlying]] value of the [[Collateral|collateral]].

A [[Loan|loan]] for a commercial building, for example, generates interest and [[Principal|principal]] payments based on [[lease]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lease|lease]].asp) income from tenants. If the building is not fully leased, the property may not generate sufficient income to repay the loan. Since the building serves as [[Collateral|collateral]] for the loan, bank regulators also consider the market value of the building itself.

A U.S. [[Treasury bond]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp), on the other hand, is secured by the ability of the federal government to generate taxes. These securities carry a higher [[credit rating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp), and holding these assets requires the bank to carry far less capital than a [[commercial loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercial-[[Loan|loan]].asp). Under Basel III, U.S. government [[Debt|debt]] and securities are given a [[Risk|risk]] weight of 0%, while residential mortgages not guaranteed by the U.S. government are [[Weighted|weighted]] anywhere from 35% to 200% depending on a [[Risk Assessment|risk assessment]] sliding scale.

## Special Considerations

Bank managers are also responsible for using assets to generate a reasonable [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp). In some cases, assets that carry more [[Risk|risk]] can also generate a higher [[Return|return]] for the bank, because those assets generate a higher level of interest income to the [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp). If the management creates a diverse [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of assets, the institution can generate a reasonable return on the assets and also meet the regulator’s capital requirements.
