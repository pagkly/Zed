[[Fundamentals]]
## What Are [[Fundamentals]]?

[[Fundamentals]] include the basic [[qualitative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualitativeanalysis.asp) and quantitative information that contributes to the financial or economic well-being of a company, [[Security|security]], or currency, and their subsequent financial [[valuation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp). Where qualitative information includes elements that cannot be directly measured, such as management experience, [[quantitative analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitativeanalysis.asp) (QA) uses mathematics and statistics to understand the asset and predict its movements.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Fundamentals]] provide a method to set the financial value of a company, [[Security|security]], or currency.
-   Included in [[Fundamental Analysis|fundamental analysis]] is basic qualitative and quantitative information that contributes to the asset's financial or economic well-being.
-   Macroeconomic [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] include topics that affect an economy at large.
-   Microeconomic [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] focus on the activities within smaller segments of the economy.
-   For businesses, information such as profitability, revenue, assets, liabilities, and growth potential are considered [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]].

#### What Is [[Fundamental Analysis]]?

## Understanding [[Fundamentals]]

In business and [[Economics|economics]], [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] represent the primary characteristics and financial data necessary to determine the stability and health of an [[asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp). This data can include [[macroeconomic]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[Macroeconomics|macroeconomics]].asp), or large-scale factors, and [[microeconomic]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microeconomics.asp), or small-scale factors to set a value on securities or businesses.

Analysts and investors examine these [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] to develop an estimate as to whether the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset is considered a worthwhile investment, and if there is fair valuation in the market. For businesses, information such as profitability, [[revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp), assets, [[liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liability|liability]].asp), and growth potential are considered fundamentals. Through the use of [[Fundamental Analysis|fundamental analysis]], you may calculate a company's [[financial ratios]](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-ratios-4689817) to determine the feasibility of the investment.

While [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] are most often considered factors that relate to particular businesses or securities, national economies, and their currencies also have a set of fundamentals that can be analyzed. For example, interest rates, [[gross domestic product]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) (GDP) growth, trade balance [[Surplus|surplus]]/deficits, and inflation levels are some factors that are considered to be fundamentals of a nation's value.

## Macroeconomic and Microeconomic [[Fundamentals]]

Macroeconomic [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] are topics that affect an economy at-large, including statistics regarding [[unemployment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Unemployment|unemployment]].asp), [[supply and demand]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-[[Supply|supply]]-demand.asp), growth, and [[inflation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp), as well as considerations for monetary or [[Fiscal Policy|fiscal policy]] and international trade. These categories can be applied to the analysis of a large-scale economy as a whole or can be related to individual business activity to make changes based on macroeconomic influences. Large scale, macroeconomic fundamentals are also part of the [[top-down analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/topdownanalysis.asp) of individual companies.

Microeconomic [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] focus on the activities within smaller segments of the economy, such as a particular market or sector. This small-scale focus can include issues of [[Supply|supply]] and demand within the specified segment, labor, and both consumer and firm theories. [[Consumer theory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-theory.asp) investigates how people spend within their particular budget restraints. The [[theory of the firm]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/theory-firm.asp) states that a business exists and makes decisions to earn profits.

## [[Fundamentals]] in Business

By looking at the [[Economics|economics]] of a business, including the overall management and the [[financial statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp), investors are looking at a company's [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]]. Not only do these data points show the health of the business, but they also indicate the probability of further growth. A company with little [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp) and sufficient cash is considered to have strong fundamentals.

Strong [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] suggest that a business has a viable framework or [[Financial Structure|financial structure]]. Conversely, those with weak fundamentals may have issues in the areas of [[Debt|debt]] obligation management, cost control, or overall organizational management. A business with strong fundamentals may be more likely to survive adverse events, like economic [[recessions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp) or [[depressions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depression.asp), than one with weaker fundamentals. Also, strength may indicate less [[Risk|risk]] should an investor consider purchasing securities associated with the businesses mentioned.

## [[Fundamental Analysis]]

Investors and financial analysts are interested in evaluating the [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] of a company to compare its economic position relative to its industry peers, to the broader market, or to itself over time. [[Fundamental Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] involves digging deep into a company's financial statements to extract its profit and growth potential, relative riskiness, and to ultimately decide if its [[Shares|shares]] are over, under, or fairly valued in the market.

Often [[Fundamental Analysis|fundamental analysis]] involves computing and analyzing ratios to make apples-to-apples comparisons. Some common fundamental analysis ratios are [[Listed|listed]] below.

-   The [[debt-to-equity ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp) (DE) measures how a company is financing its operations. 
-   The [[quick ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quickratio.asp) measures the company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations.
-   The [[degree of financial leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dfl.asp) (DFL) measures the stability or [[Volatility|volatility]] of the [[Earnings Per Share (EPS)|earnings per share (EPS)]].
-   The [[price-to-earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) (P/E) ratio compares investment to earnings dollars.
-   The [[DuPont analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dupontanalysis.asp) looks at [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]] (ROE) by looking at asset use efficiency, operating efficiency, and financial [[Leverage|leverage]].

[[Fundamental Analysis|Fundamental analysis]] should be carried out with a holistic approach, utilizing several ratios and including a bottom-up as well as a [[Top-Down Analysis|top-down analysis]] to come to specific conclusions and actions.

## Real World Example

In the fourth quarter of 2018, according to MarketWatch, large-cap tech companies Microsoft and Apple had similar market caps for the first time since 2010. Although the two companies had similar market caps of about $850 billion, they had very different [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]]. For example, Microsoft was trading at 45X [[earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp) while Apple was trading at 15X earnings11

Also, while Microsoft’s earnings were predicated on software as a service (SaaS) and software sales, Apple’s were still primarily dependent on hardware sales. Apple’s revenue base is about 2½ times Microsoft’s; the global market for its devices is far more saturated than the global market for Microsoft’s software22

Though both companies had a similar market cap, they had very different [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]], which would need to be considered when choosing them as potential investments, particularly in determining future growth prospects.
