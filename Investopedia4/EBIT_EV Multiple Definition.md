EBIT/EV [[Multiple Definition]]
## What Is the EBIT/EV Multiple?

The EBIT/EV multiple, shorthand for [[earnings before interest and taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT) divided by [[enterprise value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp) (EV), is a financial ratio used to measure a company's "earnings [[Yield|yield]]."

The concept of the EBIT/EV multiple as a proxy for [[earnings yield]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsyield.asp) and value was introduced by Joel Greenblatt, a noteworthy [[value investor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp) and professor at Columbia Business School.

### Key Takeaways

-   Investors and analysts use the EBIT/EV multiple to understand how earnings [[Yield|yield]] translates into a company's value.
-   The higher the EBIT/EV multiple, the better for the investor as this indicates the company has low [[Debt|debt]] levels and higher amounts of cash.
-   The EBIT/EV multiple allows investors to effectively compare earnings yields between companies with different [[Debt|debt]] levels and tax rates, among other things.

## Understanding the EBIT/EV Multiple

Enterprise value (EV) is a measure used to value a company. Investors often use EV when comparing companies against one another for possible investment because EV provides a clearer picture of the real value of a company as opposed to simply considering [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp).

EV is an important component of several ratios investors can use to compare companies, such as the EBIT/EV multiple and [[EV/Sales]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevaluesales.asp). The EV of a business can be calculated using the following formula:  

> EV = [[Equity]] [[Market Capitalization]] + Total [[Debt]] − Cash (& [[Cash Equivalents]])

The EV result shows how much money would be needed to buy the whole company. Some EV calculations include the addition of [[minority interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minorityinterest.asp) and [[preferred stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp). However, for the vast majority of companies, minority interest and [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] in the capital structure is uncommon. Thus, EV is generally calculated without them.

EBIT/EV is supposed to be an earnings [[Yield|yield]], so the higher the multiple, the better for an investor. There is an implicit bias toward companies with lower levels of [[Debt|debt]] and higher amounts of cash. A company with a leveraged [[balance sheet]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp), all else being equal, is riskier than a company with less [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp). The company with modest amounts of debt and/or greater cash [[Holdings|holdings]] [[Will|will]] have a smaller EV, which would produce a higher earnings yield.

## Benefits of the EBIT/EV Multiple

The EBIT/EV ratio can provide a better comparison than more conventional profitability ratios, such as [[return on equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) (ROE) or [[return on invested capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp) (ROIC). While the EBIT/EV ratio is not commonly used, it does have a couple of key advantages in comparing companies.

First, employing EBIT as a measure of profitability, as opposed to [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) (NI), eliminates the potentially distorting effects of differences in tax rates. Second, using EBIT/EV normalizes for effects of different [[capital structures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp).

Greenblatt states that EBIT "allows us to put companies with different levels of [[Debt|debt]] and different [[tax rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxrate.asp) on an equal footing when comparing earnings yields." In his eyes, EV is more appropriate as the denominator because it takes into account the value of [[debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp), as well as the [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]].

A downside to the EBIT/EV ratio is that it does not normalize for depreciation and [[amortization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp) costs. Thus, there are still potential distorting effects when companies use different methods of accounting for fixed assets.

## Example of the EBIT/EV Multiple

Say Company X has:

-   EBIT of $3.5 billion;
-   A [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] of $40 billion;
-   $7 billion in [[Debt|debt]]; and
-   $1.5 billion in cash.

Company [[Z]] has:

-   EBIT of $1.3 billion;
-   A market cap of $18 billion;
-   $12 billion in [[Debt|debt]]; and
-   $0.6 billion in cash.

EBIT/EV for Company X would be approximately 7.7%, while the earnings [[Yield|yield]] for Company [[Z]] would be approximately 4.4%. Company X's earnings yield is superior not only because it has greater EBIT, but also because it has lower [[Leverage|leverage]].
