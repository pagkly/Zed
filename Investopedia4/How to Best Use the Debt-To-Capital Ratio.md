[[How to Best Use the Debt-To-Capital Ratio]]
## What Is the [[Debt]]-To-Capital Ratio?

The [[Debt|debt]]-to-capital ratio is a measurement of a company's financial [[Leverage|leverage]]. The debt-to-capital ratio is calculated by taking the company's interest-bearing debt, both short- and long-term liabilities and dividing it by the total capital. Total capital is all interest-bearing debt plus [[shareholders' equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp), which may include items such as [[Common Stock|common stock]], [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], and minority interest.

## The Formula for [[Debt]]-To-Capital Ratio

[[Debt]]-To-Capital Ratio\=DebtDebt + Shareholders′ [[Equity]]\\text{Debt-To-Capital Ratio} = \\frac{Debt}{Debt \\text{ }+\\text{ } Shareholders'\\ Equity}

## How to Calculate [[Debt]]-To-Capital Ratio

The [[Debt|debt]]-to-capital ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s total debt by its total capital, which is total debt plus total shareholders’ [[Equity|equity]].

## What Does [[Debt]]-To-Capital Ratio Tell You?

The [[Debt|debt]]-to-capital ratio gives analysts and investors a better idea of a company's [[Financial Structure|financial structure]] and whether or not the company is a suitable investment. All else being equal, the higher the debt-to-capital ratio, the riskier the company. This is because a higher ratio, the more the company is funded by debt than [[Equity|equity]], which means a higher [[Liability|liability]] to repay the debt and a greater [[Risk|risk]] of forfeiture on the [[Loan|loan]] if the debt cannot be paid timely.

However, while a specific amount of [[Debt|debt]] may be crippling for one company, the same amount could barely affect another. Thus, using total capital gives a more accurate picture of the company's health because it frames debt as a percentage of capital rather than as a dollar amount.

### Key Takeaways

-   Measurement of a company's financial [[Leverage|leverage]], calculated by taking the company's interest-bearing [[Debt|debt]] and dividing it by total capital.
-   All else equal, the higher the [[Debt|debt]]-to-capital ratio, the riskier the company.
-   While most companies [[Finance|finance]] their operations through a mixture of [[Debt|debt]] and [[Equity|equity]], looking at the total debt of a company may not provide the best information.

## Example of How to Use [[Debt]]-To-Capital Ratio

As an example, assume a firm has $100 million in liabilities comprised of the following:

-   Notes payable $5 million
-   Bonds payable $20 million
-   Accounts payable $10 million
-   Accrued expenses $6 million
-   Deferred income $3 million
-   Long-term liabilities $55 million
-   Other long-term liabilities $1 million

Of these, only notes payable, bonds payable, and long-term liabilities are interest-bearing securities, the sum of which total $5 million + $20 million + $55 million = $80 million.

As for [[Equity|equity]], the company has $20 million worth of [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] and $3 million of minority interest [[Listed|listed]] on the books. The company has 10 million [[Shares|shares]] of [[Common Stock|common stock]] outstanding, which is currently trading at $20 per share. Total equity is $20 million + $3 million + ($20 x 10 million shares) = $223 million. Using these numbers, the calculation for the company's [[Debt|debt]]-to-capital ratio is:

-   **[[Debt]]-to-capital** = $80 million / ($80 million + $223) = $80 million / $303 million = 26.4%

Assume this company is being considered as an investment by a [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]]. If the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] manager looks at another company that had a [[Debt|debt]]-to-capital ratio of 40%, all else equal, the referenced company is a safer choice since its [[financial leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) is approximately half that of the compared company's.

As a real-life example, consider Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), which has $36.6 billion in total [[Debt|debt]] as of December 2018.1 Its shareholders’ [[Equity|equity]] for the same quarter was $14 billion.2 Thus, its debt-to-capital ratio is 73%, or $36.6 billion / ($36.6 billion + $14 billion).

## The Difference Between [[Debt]]-To-Capital Ratio and [[Debt Ratio]]

Unlike the [[Debt|debt]]-to-capital ratio, the [[debt ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtratio.asp) divides total debt by total assets. The [[Debt Ratio|debt ratio]] is a measure of how much of a company’s assets are financed with debt. The two numbers can be very similar, as total assets are equal to total liabilities plus total shareholder’ [[Equity|equity]]. However, for the debt-to-capital ratio, it excludes all other liabilities besides interest-bearing debt.

## Limitations of Using [[Debt]]-To-Capital Ratio

The [[Debt|debt]]-to-capital ratio may be affected by the accounting conventions a company uses. Often, values on a company's financial statements are based on historical cost accounting and may not reflect the true current market values. Thus, it is very important to be certain the correct values are used in the calculation, so the ratio does not become distorted.
