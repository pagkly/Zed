[[Will]]
## What Is a [[Will]]?

A [[Will|will]], also known as a [last will and testament](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/last-will-and-testament.asp), is a legally enforceable declaration of how a person wants their property and [[assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) distributed after death. In a will, a person can also recommend a guardian for their minor children and make provisions for any surviving pets.

## Understanding a [[Will]]

A [[Will|will]] is an important component of [estate planning](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-is-will.html). A will ensures that the person's wishes are carried out and can make things easier for their [heirs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp). If an individual dies without a will, the distribution of their property is left up to the government, and may even end up becoming state property. The format of wills can vary, but most follow a fairly uniform layout.

The document usually begins with a statement that the writer is of legal age and making the [[Will|will]] freely and without [duress](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duress.asp). It also attests to the writer's mental soundness at the time the will was made. This section establishes the writer's identity and includes an explicit statement that this final will rescinds all previous documents.

In the [[Will|will]] the writer names an [executor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp), who oversees the [liquidation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp) and distribution of the decedent's assets according to the terms of the will. The executor must also pay off any outstanding debts and taxes on the [[Estate|estate]]. The executor may be an attorney or financial expert, or anyone the writer of the will trusts to act responsibly. The executor may be entitled to receive a reasonable fee for services rendered. Fee guidelines may be mandated by the state.

After naming an executor and guardian for any minor children, the [[Will|will]] should discuss [[insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-coverage.asp) policies that already have a [named beneficiary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/named-beneficiary.asp). Wills do not supplant agreements related to life insurance proceeds, retirement assets or transfer-on-death investment accounts. This section may also itemize [[Joint|joint]] bank accounts and property that is co-owned with other individuals.

The [bequest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bequest.asp) section of the [[Will|will]] specifies beneficiaries for all the deceased person's property or assets, except for insurance policies and [joint accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointaccount.asp) already covered in a preceding section. Should a family's benefactor retire, it's crucial that all beneficiaries are named before [[they or their spouse dies]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/120715/what-happens-retirement-accounts-if-spouse-dies.asp) in order to ensure the financial health of their loved ones. Clear and reasonable instructions are important for preventing possible legal challenges that could delay [probate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Probate|probate]].asp) and create significant legal expenses.

A [[Will|will]] may also include instructions about the writer's funeral and burial wishes. If the [[decedent]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decedent.asp) has made prior arrangements for a burial plot or funeral expenses, those will usually be discussed in this section.

## State Requirements for Wills

Most states require that the [[Will|will]] be witnessed by two individuals and signed by the writer at the end of the document. [[Holographic wills]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holographic-will.asp) may be used in some states. After death, the will is submitted to the [probate court](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Probate|probate]]-court.asp) of the county or city in which the individual resided. The probate process can be fairly quick or protracted, depending on the complexity of the [[estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Estate|estate]].asp) and whether there are legal challenges to the will.
