[[Quant Fund]]
## What Is a [[Quant Fund]]?

The term [[Quant Fund|quant fund]] refers to an [[investment fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-fund.asp) whose securities are chosen based on numerical data compiled through [[quantitative analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitativeanalysis.asp). These funds are considered non-traditional and passive.1 They are built with customized models using software programs to determine investments. Proponents of quant funds believe that choosing investments using inputs and computer programs helps fund companies cut down on the risks and losses associated with management by human [[fund managers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundmanager.asp).2

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Quant Fund|quant fund]] makes investment decisions based on the use of advanced quantitative analysis.
-   Managers utilize algorithms and custom-built computer models to pick their investments. 
-   Investors are turning to and sticking with quantitative analysis within funds because of the rising availability of market data. 
-   Although quant funds utilize state of the art technology, the use of quantitative analysis isn't new.

## How a [[Quant Fund]] Works

Quant funds rely on algorithmic or systematically programmed [[investment strategies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstrategy.asp). As such, they don't use the experience, judgment, or opinions of human managers to make investment decisions.3 That being said, they use quantitative analysis rather than [[fundamental analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp), which is why they're also called quantitative funds.4 Not only can they be one of many investment offerings supported by asset managers, but they may also be part of the central management focus of specialized investment managers.

Greater access to a broader range of market data fueled the growth of quant funds, not to mention the growing number of solutions surrounding the use of big data. Developments in [[financial technology]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp) and increasing innovation around automation have vastly broadened the data sets [[Quant Fund|quant fund]] managers can work with, giving them even more [[Robust|robust]] data feeds for a broader analysis of scenarios and time horizons.5 

[[Quant Fund|Quant fund]] programming and quantitative algorithms have thousands of [[trading signals]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-signal.asp) they can rely on, ranging from economic data points to trending global [[asset values]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetvaluation.asp) and real-time company news. Quant funds are also known for building sophisticated models around [[Momentum|momentum]], quality, value, and financial strength using proprietary algorithms developed through advanced software programs.2

Large [[asset managers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetmanagement.asp) have looked to increase their investment in quantitative strategies as fund managers struggle to beat market [[benchmarks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) over time. Smaller [[hedge fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) managers also round out the total [[Quant Fund|quant fund]] offerings in the investment market.6 Overall, quant fund managers seek talented individuals with accredited academic degrees and highly technical experience in mathematics and programming.7

Quantitative strategies are often referred to as a Black Box due to the high level of secrecy surrounding the algorithms they use.

## Special Considerations

Quant funds are often classified as alternative investments since their management styles differ from more traditional fund managers. They generally charge relatively higher [[management fees]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/managementfee.asp). Their offerings are also more complex than standard funds.2

Some of these funds may target high-net-worth investors or have high fund entrance requirements, similar to regulated [[mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) and [[exchange-traded funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (ETFs). [[Hedge]] funds are also known for [[Offering|offering]] quantitative investment offerings with less regulated management requirements.

Some investors consider quant funds to be some of the most innovative and highly technical offerings in the investment universe. As such, they encompass a wide range of thematic investment styles and often deploy some of the industry’s most groundbreaking technologies.

### Performance

According to a report by Institutional Investor, quant funds attracted a considerable amount of interest and investment because of the returns they paid. But they've been [[underperforming]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underperform|underperform]].asp) since the mid-2010s. The report compared the [[MSCI]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[MSCI|msci]].asp) World index with the [[Equity|equity]] quant index, which returned 11.6% on an annualized basis compared to 0.88% through November on an annualized basis, respectively. Despite, this, investors remain confident about their performance going forward.8

## History of Quant Funds

The basis for quantitative analysis and, therefore, quant funds, has a history that dates back eight decades, with the publishing of a 1934 book called _Security Analysis_. Written by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, the book advocated investing based on the rigorous measurement of objective financial [[metrics]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) related to specific [[stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Stock|stock]].asp).

_Security Analysis_ has been followed by further publications related to quantitative investment strategies, such as Joel Greenblatt’s _The Little Book that Beats the Market_ and James O'Shaughnessy’s _What Works on Wall Street_.
