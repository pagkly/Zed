## What Is a Trading Platform?

The [[best trading platforms]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-web-trading-platforms-4587883) [[Offer|offer]] a mix of [[Robust|robust]] features and low fees.

## Basics of Trading Platform

A trading platform is the software that enables investors and traders to place trades and monitor accounts through financial intermediaries. Oftentimes, trading platforms [[Will|will]] come bundled with other features, such as real-time quotes, charting tools, news feeds, and even [[Premium|premium]] research. Platforms may also be specifically tailored to specific markets, such as [[Stocks|stocks]], [[currencies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp), options, or [[futures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Futures|futures]].asp) markets.

There are two types of trading platforms: prop platforms and commercial platforms. As their name indicates, commercial platforms are targeted at day traders and retail investors. They are characterized by ease-of-use and an assortment of helpful features, such as news feeds and charts, for investor education and research. Prop platforms, on the other hand, are customized platforms developed by large brokerages to suit their specific requirements and trading style.

Traders use a variety of different trading platforms depending on their trading style and volume.

You'll learn market terminology, techniques for identifying trends, and even build your own trading system in over five hours of on-demand video, exercises, and interactive content.

## Picking a Platform

When deciding between trading platforms, traders and investors should consider both the fees involved and features available. [[Day traders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daytrader.asp) and other short-term traders may require features like [[Level 2]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/level2.asp) quotes and market maker depth charts to assist in decision-making, while [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) traders may need tools that are specifically designed to visualize options strategies.

Fees are another important consideration while choosing trading platforms. For example, traders who employ [[scalping]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalping.asp) as a trading strategy [[Will|will]] gravitate towards platforms with low fees. In general, lower fees are always preferable but there may be trade-offs to consider. For example, low fees may not be advantageous if they translate to fewer features and informational research.

Some trading platforms may be agnostic to a specific [[intermediary]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialintermediary.asp) or broker, while other trading platforms are only available when working with a particular intermediary or broker. As a result, investors should also consider the reputation of the intermediary or broker before committing to a specific trading platform to execute trades and manage their accounts.

Finally, trading platforms may have specific requirements to qualify for their use. For example, day trading platforms may require that traders have at least $25,000 in [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) in their accounts and be approved for [[margin trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buying-on-margin.asp), while options platforms may require approval to trade various types of options before being able to use the trading platform.
