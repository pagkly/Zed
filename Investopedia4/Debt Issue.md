[[Debt Issue]]
## What Is a [[Debt Issue]]?

A [[Debt Issue|debt issue]] refers to a financial obligation that allows the issuer to raise funds by promising to repay the [[Lender|lender]] at a certain point in the future and in accordance with the terms of the contract. A [[Debt|debt]] issue is a fixed corporate or government obligation such as a bond or [[debenture]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debenture.asp). Debt issues also include notes, certificates, [[mortgages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp), leases, or other agreements between the issuer or borrower, and the lender.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Debt]] issues are generally fixed corporate or government obligations such as bonds or debentures.
-   The seller promises the investor regular interest payments and a repayment of the invested [[Principal|principal]] on a predetermined date.

## Understanding [[Debt]] Issues

When a company or government agency decides to take out a [[loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Loan|loan]].asp), it has two options. The first is to get financing from a bank. The other option is to issue [[Debt|debt]] to investors in the [[Capital Markets What You Should Know|capital markets]]. This is referred to as a [[Debt Issue|debt issue]]—the issuance of a [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]] by an entity in need of capital to fund new or existing projects or to [[Finance|finance]] existing debt. This method of raising [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) may be preferred, as securing a bank loan can restrict how the funds can be used.

A [[Debt Issue|debt issue]] is essentially a [[promissory note]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp) in which the issuer is the borrower, and the entity buying the [[Debt|debt]] asset is the [[Lender|lender]]. When a debt issue is made available, investors buy it from the seller who uses the funds to pursue its capital projects. In [[Return|return]], the investor is promised regular interest payments and also a repayment of the invested [[Principal|principal]] on a predetermined date in the future.

By issuing [[Debt|debt]], an entity is free to use the capital it raises as it sees fit.

Corporations and municipal, state, and federal governments [[Offer|offer]] [[Debt|debt]] issues as a means of raising needed funds. Debt issues such as [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) are issued by corporations to raise money for certain projects or to expand into new markets. Municipalities, states, federal, and foreign governments issue debt to [[Finance|finance]] a variety of projects such as social programs or local infrastructure projects.

In exchange for the [[Loan|loan]], the issuer or borrower must make payments to the investors in the form of interest payments. The interest rate is often called the [[coupon rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp), and coupon payments are made using a predetermined schedule and rate.

## Special Considerations

When the [[Debt Issue|debt issue]] matures, the issuer repays the [[face value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp) of the asset to the investors. Face value, also referred to as [[par value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp), differs across the various types of [[Debt|debt]] issues. For example, the face value on a corporate bond is typically $1,000. Municipal bonds often have $5,000 par values and federal bonds often have $10,000 par values.

Short-term bills typically have [[maturities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp) between one and five years, [[medium-term notes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mtn.asp) mature between five and ten years, while long-term bonds generally have maturities longer than ten years. Certain large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Walt Disney have issued bonds with maturities as long as 100 years.

## The Process of [[Debt]] Issuance

### Corporate [[Debt]] Issuance

Issuing [[Debt|debt]] is a corporate action which a company's board of directors must approve. If debt issuance is the best course of action for raising capital and the firm has sufficient cash flows to make regular interest payments on the issue, the board drafts a proposal that is sent to investment bankers and underwriters. Corporate debt issues are commonly issued through the [[underwriting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp) process in which one or more securities firms or banks purchase the issue in its entirety from the issuer and form a syndicate tasked with marketing and reselling the issue to interested investors. The interest rate set on the bonds is based on the [[credit rating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) of the company and the demand from investors. The underwriters impose a fee on the issuer in [[Return|return]] for their services.

### Government [[Debt]] Issuance

The process for government [[Debt|debt]] issues is different since these are typically issued in an [[auction]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp) format. In the United States, for example, investors can purchase bonds directly from the government through its dedicated website, TreasuryDirect. A [[broker]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) is not needed, and all transactions, including interest payments, are handled electronically. Debt issued by the government is considered to be a safe investment since it is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Since investors are guaranteed they [[Will|will]] receive a certain interest rate and face value on the bond, interest rates on government issues tend to be lower than rates on corporate bonds.

## [[Cost of Debt]]

The interest rate paid on a [[Debt Instrument|debt instrument]] represents a cost to the issuer and a [[Return|return]] to the investor. The [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]] represents the [[default risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp) of an issuer, and also reflects the level of interest rates in the market. In addition, it is integral in calculating the [[weighted-average cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) (WACC) of a company, which is a measure of the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] and the after-tax cost of [[Debt|debt]].

One way to estimate the [[Cost of Debt|cost of debt]] is to measure the current [[yield-to-maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/[[Y|y]]/yieldtomaturity.asp) (YTM) of the [[Debt Issue|debt issue]]. Another way is to review the credit [[Rating|rating]] of the issuer from the rating agencies such as Moody's, Fitch, and Standard & Poor's. A [[Yield|yield]] spread over U.S. Treasuries—determined from the credit rating—can then be added to the [[risk-free rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]]-freerate.asp) to determine the cost of [[Debt|debt]].

There are also fees associated with issuing [[Debt|debt]] that the borrower incurs by selling assets. Some of these fees include legal fees, [[Underwriting Fees|underwriting fees]], and registration fees. These charges are generally paid to legal representatives, financial institutions and investment firms, auditors, and regulators. All of these parties are involved in the underwriting process.
