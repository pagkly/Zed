[[Ethereum]]
## What Is [[Ethereum]]

Launched in 2015, [[Ethereum]] is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized software platform used for its own [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]], ether. It enables SmartContracts and Distributed Applications (ĐApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a [[Third Party|third party]].

[Ethereum](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032216/[[Ethereum|ethereum]]-more-important-bitcoin.asp) is not just a platform but also a programming language (Turing complete) running on a blockchain, helping developers to build and publish distributed applications.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Ethereum]] is an open-source computing platform and operating system.
-   It also has its own associated [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]], ether.
-   One of the big projects around [[Ethereum]] is Microsoft’s partnership with ConsenSys.

## Understanding [[Ethereum]]

The applications run on [[Ethereum]] are run on a platform-specific cryptographic token, ether. During 2014, Ethereum had launched a pre-sale for ether which had received an overwhelming response. Ether is like a vehicle for moving around on the Ethereum platform and is mostly sought by developers looking to develop and run applications inside Ethereum. Ether is used broadly for two purposes: it is traded as a [[Digital Currency|digital currency]] exchange like other [[cryptocurrencies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]].asp), and it is used inside Ethereum to run applications and even to monetize work.

According to [[Ethereum]], it can be used to “codify, decentralize, secure, and trade just about anything.” One of the big projects around Ethereum is Microsoft’s partnership with ConsenSys which offers “Ethereum Blockchain as a Service (EBaaS) on Microsoft Azure so Enterprise clients and developers can have a single click cloud-based blockchain developer environment.”

In 2016, [[Ethereum]] was split into two separate blockchains, Ethereum, and [[Ethereum Classic]], after a malicious actor stole more than $50 million worth of funds which had been raised on the DAO, a set of smart contracts originating from Ethereum's software platform. The new Ethereum was a hard fork from the original software intended to protect against further malware attacks. As of September 2019, Ethereum was the second-largest [[Virtual Currency|virtual currency]] on the market, behind only Bitcoin. It is much faster to acquire ether currency than bitcoin (about 14 or 15 seconds to bitcoin's near-uniform 10 minutes), and there are far more ether units in circulation than there is bitcoin.
