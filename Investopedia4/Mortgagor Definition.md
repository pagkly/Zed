[[Mortgagor Definition]]
## What is a Mortgagor

A mortgagor is that who borrows money from a [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) in order to purchase a home or other piece of real [[Estate|estate]]. Mortgagors can obtain mortgage loans with varying terms based on their credit profile and [[Collateral|collateral]]. In a mortgage [[Loan|loan]] the mortgagor must pledge the title to the [[Real Property|real property]] as collateral for the loan.

This can be contrasted with a [[mortgagee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgagee.asp), who is the entity that lends money to a borrower for the purpose of purchasing real [[Estate|estate]].

### Key Takeaways

-   A mortgagor is the person or other entity that receives a mortgage [[Loan|loan]] in order to buy property.
-   Before obtaining a [[Loan|loan]], a mortgagor must complete an application and be approved by the [[Lender|lender]]'s underwriters.
-   Once the [[Loan|loan]] has been funded, the mortgagor is responsible for making timely payments of interest and [[Principal|principal]]. If they do not, they may ultimately be subject to foreclosure on the home.

## Understanding Mortgagors

Mortgagors can obtain varying mortgage [[Loan|loan]] terms based on underwriting factors associated with a [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) loan. Mortgage loans are a type of secured loan therefore one commonality among all mortgage loans is the pledging of real [[Estate|estate]] [[Collateral|collateral]].

In a mortgage [[Loan|loan]] the mortgagor is the party receiving the loan and the mortgagee is the party [[Offering|offering]] the loan. The mortgagor must submit a [[credit application]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-application.asp) and agree to the mortgage loan terms if approved for a loan. The mortgagee has the authority to determine the terms of the mortgage loan, oversee the servicing of the loan and manage the title rights to the real [[Estate|estate]] [[Collateral|collateral]].

## Applying for a Mortgage [[Loan]]

Similar to other types of loans in the credit market, the terms of a mortgage [[Loan|loan]] [[Will|will]] be based on the borrower’s credit application and the lenders [[Underwriting Standards|underwriting standards]]. Mortgage loan underwriting will focus on a borrower’s [[Credit Score|credit score]], credit history and [[Debt|debt]]-to income levels. However, different from other types of loans, a mortgage loan will also closely consider a borrower’s housing expense ratio. Underwriters analyze these three components when assessing a mortgagor for mortgage loan approval. They also use a mortgagor’s [[housing expense ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_expense_ratio.asp) to determine the maximum amount issued with the loan. Lenders have varying standards for mortgage loan approvals. Generally traditional lenders will require a credit score of 620 or higher, a debt-to-income level of 36% and a housing expense ratio of 28%.12 Housing expenses included in the housing expense ratio can vary by [[Lender|lender]] with the key component being the mortgagor’s monthly mortgage payment.

## Mortgage [[Loan]] Contract Obligations

Mortgagors approved for a mortgage [[Loan|loan]] must agree to the terms offered by the mortgagee in order to complete the deal. A mortgage loan contract [[Will|will]] include the mortgagor’s interest rate and duration. The mortgagor is required to make monthly payments of [[Principal|principal]] and interest in order to keep the loan in good standing with the mortgagee. Mortgage loan contracts also include provisions for title ownership and a [[lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp) on the real [[Estate|estate]] property as [[Collateral|collateral]]. Provisions pertaining to the collateral outline the requirements for maintaining monthly payments and the specifications regarding any missed payments. Terms can vary regarding the number of delinquent payments allowed and when the [[Lender|lender]] can take action with the lien to seize the property in [[Default|default]].
