[[Lease Rate]]
## What Is a [[Lease Rate]]?

A [[Lease Rate|lease rate]] is the amount of money paid over a specified time period for the rental of an asset, such as [[real property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-property.asp) or an automobile. The [[Lease|lease]] rate that the [[lessor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lessor|lessor]].asp) earns from allowing someone else to use their property compensates them for not being able to use that property during the term of the lease.

-   A [[Lease Rate|lease rate]] is an amount paid by the [[Lessee|lessee]] to the [[Lessor|lessor]] for use of an asset for a set period of time.
-   [[Lease]] rates are generally expressed as dollars per month, but they can also be stated as dollars per square foot of space per year—as is the case with commercial real [[Estate|estate]].
-   The terms of the [[Lease|lease]] [[Will|will]] spell out the time period that the [[Lease Rate|lease rate]] applies for and may also spell out incremental increases in the lease rate over multi-year leases.

## How a [[Lease Rate]] Works

A [[Lease Rate|lease rate]] can have different nuances depending on what type of property is being leased. In [[commercial real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialrealestate.asp), the [[Lease|lease]] rate is the cost to occupy the space, commonly stated as a dollar amount per square foot of space per year. The lease rate can also be stated in terms of dollars per month, as with a rental agreement, or even dollars per year.

The terms of the [[Lease|lease]] [[Will|will]] spell out the time period that the [[Lease Rate|lease rate]] applies for and may also spell out incremental increases in the lease rate over multi-year leases. To get a true idea of the cost of renting a space, in addition to the lease rate, the potential tenant will need to know if the lease is single, double or [[triple net]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triple-net-lease-nnn.asp), in other words, whether they or the property owner will be responsible for expenses such as utilities, maintenance, and property taxes.

Because most commercial [[Lease|lease]] rates are set out in dollars per square foot, it makes it easier for the potential [[Lessee|lessee]] (tenant) to compare the leasing costs of properties with different size profiles.

## Special Considerations

The question of when to [[Lease|lease]] equipment or space rather than building or buying is one that businesses struggle with. Generally speaking, the key factor is how long the leased property is expected to be in use. For shorter-term surges in equipment demand or operational expansion pushed by temporary market conditions, leasing is an excellent solution that minimizes [[sunk costs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sunkcost.asp).

If the increased demand is expected to be long term, then the up-front costs of ownership usually dwindle in comparison with the savings over time and the potential for [[appreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appreciation.asp) in a commercial property.

That said, some companies prefer to [[Lease|lease]] over the [[Long Term|long term]] anyway, as it relieves the company from having to worry about non-core business issues like equipment and building maintenance.

## Types of [[Lease]] Rates

### Auto Leases

When it comes to cars and equipment, the leasing company essentially buys the car from the dealer and rents it to you. So the [[Lessor|lessor]] has “lent” the money for the purchase upfront and you are paying back on that [[Loan|loan]].

Although the dealer and the leasing party can be the same person, setting up the three-party agreement allows the dealership to sell inventory to the leasing arm and the leasing arm to generate income on these pseudo loans before moving the vehicle back into the dealership as used inventory. The [[Lessee|lessee]] gets a car that they can use without the burden of ownership.

In the case of an automobile [[Lease|lease]], the monthly payment on the vehicle is based on the car's expected depreciation and [[Residual Value|residual value]]—a predetermined amount that the car [[Will|will]] be worth at the end of the lease term—as well as the [[Lease Rate|lease rate]], which is usually stated as a percentage. Through monthly payments, the [[Lessee|lessee]] compensates the automobile dealer for both the vehicle's depreciation and for tying up assets in vehicles instead of investing that money elsewhere.

In this case, the [[Lease Rate|lease rate]] is roughly equivalent to an interest rate. The [[lease payments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lease|lease]]-payments.asp) include the lease rate factor, also called the [[money factor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-factor.asp), that captures the financing element of car leases.

### Space Leases

In the case of commercial property, the building has been constructed as an investment with the hopes of bringing in tenants. There are only two entities in this transaction, and any compensation for the initial investment in the building is baked into the [[Lease Rate|lease rate]] as part of the overall business plan.
