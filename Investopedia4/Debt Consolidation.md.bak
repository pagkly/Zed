[[Debt Consolidation]]
## What Is [[Debt Consolidation]]?

[[Debt Consolidation|Debt consolidation]] refers to the act of taking out a new [[Loan|loan]] to pay off other liabilities and [[consumer debts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-[[Debt|debt]].asp). Multiple debts are combined into a single, larger debt, such as a loan, usually with more favorable payoff terms—a lower interest rate, lower monthly payment, or both. Debt consolidation can be used as a tool to deal with student loan debt, [[credit card debt]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp), and other liabilities.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Debt Consolidation|Debt consolidation]] is the act of taking out a single [[Loan|loan]] to pay off multiple debts.
-   There are two different kinds of [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] loans: secured and [[Unsecured|unsecured]].
-   Consumers can apply for [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] loans, lower-interest credit cards, HELOCs, and special programs for student loans.
-   Benefits of [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] include a single monthly payment in lieu of multiple payments and a lower interest rate.

## How [[Debt Consolidation]] Works

[[Debt Consolidation|Debt consolidation]] is the process of using different forms of [[financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp) to pay off other debts and [[liabilities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liability|liability]].asp). If you are saddled with different kinds of [[Debt|debt]], you can apply for a [[Loan|loan]] to consolidate those debts into a single liability and pay them off. Payments are then made on the new debt until it is paid off in full.

Most people apply through their bank, [[credit union]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditunion.asp), or credit card company for a [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] [[Loan|loan]] as their first step. It's a good place to start, especially if you have a great relationship and payment history with your institution. If you’re turned down, try exploring private [[mortgage companies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage-company.asp) or lenders.1

[Creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) are willing to do this for several reasons. [[Debt Consolidation|Debt consolidation]] maximizes the likelihood of collecting from a [[Debtor|debtor]]. These loans are usually offered by financial institutions such as banks and [[credit unions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditunion.asp), but there are other specialized [[Debt|debt]] consolidation service companies that provide these services to the general public.1

### [[Debt]] settlement vs. [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]]

An important point to note is that [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] loans don’t erase the original [[Debt|debt]]. Instead, they simply transfer a consumer's loans to a different [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) or type of [[Loan|loan]]. For actual [[debt relief]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-debt-relief-companies-4846588) or for those who don't qualify for loans, it may be best to look into a debt settlement rather than, or in conjunction with, a debt consolidation loan.1

[[Debt]] settlement aims to reduce a consumer's obligations rather than the number of creditors. Consumers can work with debt-relief organizations or [[credit counseling]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-counseling.asp) services. These organizations do not make actual loans but try to renegotiate the borrower’s current debts with creditors.

To consolidate debts and save money, you’ll need [[Good Credit|good credit]] to qualify for a competitive interest rate.

## Types of [[Debt Consolidation]]

There are two broad types of [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] loans: [[secured and unsecured loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110614/what-difference-between-secured-and-[[Unsecured|unsecured]]-debts.asp). Secured loans are backed by one of the borrower’s assets, such as a house or a car. The asset, in turn, works as [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/[[Collateral|collateral]]/) for the [[Loan|loan]].1

[Unsecured loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp), on the other hand, are not backed by assets and can be more difficult to obtain. They also tend to have higher interest rates and lower qualifying amounts. With either type of [[Loan|loan]], interest rates are still typically lower than the rates charged on credit cards. And in most cases, the rates are [fixed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp), so they do not vary over the repayment period.

There are several ways you can lump your debts together by consolidating them into a single payment. Below are a few of the most common.

### [[Debt Consolidation|Debt consolidation]] loans

Many lenders—traditional banks and [[peer-to-peer lenders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peer-to-peer-lending.asp)—[[Offer|offer]] [[debt consolidation loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-personal-loans-for-[[Debt|debt]]-consolidation-4779764) as part of a payment plan to borrowers who have difficulty managing the number or size of their outstanding debts. These are designed specifically for consumers who want to pay down multiple, high-interest debts.

### Credit cards

Another method is to consolidate all your credit card payments into a new credit card. This new card can be a good idea if it charges little or no interest for a set period of time. You may also use an existing credit card's [[balance transfer]](https://www.investopedia.com/credit-cards/balance-transfer-credit-card/) feature—especially if it offers a special promotion on the transaction.1

### HELOCs

[[Home Equity|Home equity]] loans or [[home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/) can also be used for [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]].

### Student [[Loan|loan]] programs

The federal government offers several [[consolidation options]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/011916/student-[[Loan|loan]]-refinancing-pros-and-cons.asp) for people with student loans, including direct consolidation loans through the [[Federal Direct Loan Program]]. The new interest rate is the [[Weighted|weighted]] average of the previous loans. Private loans don't qualify for this program, however.2

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Consolidation Loans

If you are considering a [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] [[Loan|loan]] there are advantages and disadvantages to consider.

### Advantages

[[Debt Consolidation|Debt consolidation]] is a great tool for people who have multiple debts with high-interest rates or monthly payments—especially for those who owe $10,000 or more. By negotiating one of these loans, you can benefit from a single monthly payment in lieu of multiple payments, not to mention a lower [[interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp).1

And as long as you don't take out any additional [[Debt|debt]], you can also look forward to becoming debt-free sooner. Going through the [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] process can cut down calls or letters from [[collection agencies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collectionagency.asp), provided the new [[Loan|loan]] is kept up to date.

### Disadvantages

Although the interest rate and monthly payment may be lower on a [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] [[Loan|loan]], it's important to pay attention to the payment schedule. Longer payment schedules mean paying more in the long run. If you consider consolidation loans, speak to your credit card issuer(s) to find out how long it [[Will|will]] take to pay off debts at their current interest rate and compare that to the potential new loan.1

There's also the potential loss of special provisions on school [[Debt|debt]], such as interest rate discounts and other rebates. Consolidating debt can cause these provisions to disappear. Those who [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on consolidated school loans usually have their [[tax refunds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-refund.asp) garnished and may even have their wages attached, for example.1

[[Debt Consolidation|Debt consolidation]] services often charge hefty initial and monthly fees. And you may not need them. You can consolidate [[Debt|debt]] on your own for free with a new personal [[Loan|loan]] from a bank or a low-interest credit card.

## [[Debt Consolidation]] and Credit Scores

A consolidation [[Loan|loan]] may help your [[credit score]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) down the road. Paying off the loan's [[Principal|principal]] portion sooner can keep interest payments low, which means less money out of your pocket. This, in turn, can help boost your [[Credit Score|credit score]], making you more attractive to future creditors.3

At the same time, rolling over existing loans into a brand new one may initially have a negative impact on your [[Credit Score|credit score]]. That's because credit scores favor longer-standing debts with longer, more-consistent payment histories.3

Also, closing out old credit accounts and opening a single new one may reduce the total amount of credit available, raising your [[debt-to-credit utilization ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-utilization-rate.asp).

## Requirements for [[Debt Consolidation]]

Borrowers must have the income and [[creditworthiness]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp) necessary to qualify, especially if you're going to a brand new [[Lender|lender]]. Although the kind of documentation you'll need often depends on your [[credit history]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp), the most common pieces of information include a letter of employment, two months' worth of statements for each credit card or [[Loan|loan]] you wish to pay off, and letters from creditors or repayment agencies.4

Once you get your [[Debt Consolidation|debt consolidation]] plan in place, you should consider who you'll pay off first. In a lot of cases, this may be decided by your [[Lender|lender]], who may choose the order in which creditors are repaid. If not, pay off your highest-interest [[Debt|debt]] first. However, if you have a lower-interest [[Loan|loan]] that is causing you more emotional and mental stress than the higher-interest ones (such a personal loan that has strained family relations), you may want to start with that one instead.

Once you pay off one [[Debt|debt]], move the payments to the next set in a [[waterfall payment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/waterfallpayment.asp) process until all your bills are paid off.

## Examples of [[Debt Consolidation]]

Say you have three credit cards and owe a total of $20,000 at a 22.99% annual rate [[compounded]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp) monthly. You would need to pay $1,047.37 a month for 24 months to bring the balances down to zero. This works out to $5,136.88 paid in interest alone over time.

If you consolidated those credit cards into a lower-interest [[Loan|loan]] at an 11% annual rate compounded monthly, you would need to pay $932.16 a month for 24 months to bring the balance to zero. This works out to paying $2,371.84 in interest. The monthly savings would be $115.21, and a savings of $2,765.04 over the life of the loan.

Even if the monthly payment stays the same, you can still come out ahead by streamlining your loans. Say you have three credit cards that charge a 28% [[annual percentage rate (APR)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp). Your cards are maxed out at $5,000 each and you're spending $250 a month on each card's minimum payment. If you were to pay off each credit card separately, you would spend $750 each month for 28 months and you would end up paying a total of around $5,441.73 in interest.

However, if you transfer the balances of those three cards into one consolidated [[Loan|loan]] at a more reasonable 12% interest rate and you continue to repay the loan with the same $750 a month, you'll pay roughly one-third of the interest—$1,820.22—and you can retire your loan five months earlier. This amounts to a total savings of $7,371.51—$3,750 for payments and $3,621.51 in interest.
