[[Risk Parity Definition]]
## What Is [[Risk]] Parity?

[[Risk]] parity is a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] allocation strategy that uses risk to determine allocations across various components of an investment portfolio. The risk parity strategy modifies the [[modern portfolio theory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) (MPT) approach to investing through the use of [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp).

MPT seeks to diversify an investment [[Portfolio|portfolio]] among specified assets to optimize returns while adhering to [[market risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketrisk.asp) parameters by viewing the [[Risk|risk]] and returns for the entire portfolio, but only utilizing long and unmargined positions. With risk parity strategies, portfolio managers can derive exact capital contribution proportions of [[asset classes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) in a portfolio to achieve optimized [[Diversification|diversification]] for a range of objectives and investor preferences.

-   The [[Risk|risk]] parity approach to [[Portfolio|portfolio]] construction seeks to allocate investment capital on a risk-[[Weighted|weighted]] basis to optimally diversify investments, viewing the risk and [[Return|return]] of the entire portfolio as one.
-   The [[Risk|risk]] parity approach builds off of [[Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)|modern portfolio theory (MPT)]] but allows for the use of [[Leverage|leverage]] and [[Short Selling|short selling]].
-   [[Risk]] parity requires a great deal of quantitative calculation, which makes its allocations more advanced than simplified allocation strategies.

## Understanding [[Risk]] Parity

[[Risk]] parity is an advanced [[Portfolio|portfolio]] technique often used by [[hedge funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) and sophisticated investors. It requires a complex [[quantitative methodology]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitativeanalysis.asp), which makes its allocations more advanced than simplified allocation strategies. The goal of risk parity investing is to earn the optimal level of [[Return|return]] at the targeted risk level.

Simplified allocation strategies such as the [60%/40% [[Stocks|stocks]]-bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/011916/why-6040-[[Portfolio|portfolio]]-no-longer-good-enough.asp) portfolio make use of MPT. MPT provides a standard for [[Diversification|diversification]] within one's investment portfolio that maximizes expected [[Return|return]] for a given level of [[Risk|risk]]. In simplified MPT strategies using just stocks and bonds, [[allocations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp) are usually more heavily [[Weighted|weighted]] toward equities for investors who wish to take on more risk. Risk-averse investors [[Will|will]] instead have a higher weight in bonds for capital preservation.

[[Risk]] parity strategies allow for both [[Leverage|leverage]] and [[alternative diversification]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/092515/alternative-investments-look-pros-cons.asp), along with [[short selling]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) in portfolios and funds. Following this approach, [[Portfolio|portfolio]] managers can use any mix of assets they choose. However, instead of generating allocations to different asset classes to arrive at an optimal risk target, risk parity strategies use the optimal risk target level as their basis for investing. This goal is often achieved by using leverage to weight risk equally among different asset classes using the optimal risk target level.

## [[Risk]] Parity Methods

With a [[Risk|risk]] parity strategy, an investment [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Will|will]] often include [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds. However, instead of using a predetermined proportion of asset [[diversification]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Diversification|diversification]].asp) such as 60/40, the investment class proportions are determined by a targeted [[risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp) and [[Return|return]] level. Risk parity strategies have generally evolved and developed from MPT investing. They allow investors to target specific levels of risk and to divide risk across the entire investment portfolio to achieve optimized portfolio diversification.

The [[security market line]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sml.asp) (SML) is another part of the [[Risk|risk]] parity approach. The SML is a graphical representation of the relationship between the risk and [[Return|return]] of an asset and is used in the [[capital asset pricing model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp) (CAPM). The slope of the line is determined by the beta of the market. The line slopes upward. The greater the possibility for the return of an asset, the higher the risk associated with that asset.

There is a built-in assumption that the slope of the SML is constant. The constant slope assumption, however, may not actually be realistic. For the traditional 60/40 allocation, investors must take greater [[Risk|risk]] to achieve acceptable returns and the [[Diversification|diversification]] benefits are limited as more and riskier [[equities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) are added to the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. Risk parity solves this issue by using [[Leverage|leverage]] to equalize the amount of [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) and risk across the different assets in the portfolio.

## Real World Examples of [[Risk]] Parity

The [AQR [[Risk]] Parity Fund](https://funds.aqr.com/our-funds/global-allocation-funds/risk-parity-fund) invests globally across [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, currencies, and commodities and seeks to achieve optimal [[return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Return|return]].asp) through balanced risk parity investing.

[Horizon's Global [[Risk]] Parity ETF](https://www.horizonsetfs.com/ETF/HRA) also uses a risk parity strategy in its investments. The [[exchange traded fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (ETF) employs an equal risk-[[Weighted|weighted]] [[Volatility|volatility]] distribution to determine the amount of capital participation.
