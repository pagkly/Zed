[[Warrant Premium Definition]]
## What Is a [[Warrant]] [[Premium]]?

A [[Warrant|warrant]] [[Premium|premium]] is the difference between the current traded price of a [[warrant]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrant.asp) and its minimum value. A warrant's minimum value is the difference between its [[exercise price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp) and the current traded price of its [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]].

Alternatively, a [[Warrant|warrant]] [[Premium|premium]] is the percentage difference between the cost of purchasing [[Shares|shares]] by exercising the warrant and buying them in the [[open market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp) at the current price.

## Understanding [[Warrant]] [[Premium]]

Warrants have both a price and a [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp). Typically, the premium [[Will|will]] decrease as the price of the [[Warrant|warrant]] rises coupled with the decrease in the time to expiration. A warrant is [[in-the-money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp) when the [[Exercise Price|exercise price]] is less than the current share price. The more in-the-money the warrant is, the lower the warrant premium. High [[Volatility|volatility]] may also cause the warrant premium to be higher.

As with [[call options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), the [[Premium|premium]] can increase or decrease depending on [[Supply|supply]] and demand factors.

## Calculating the [[Warrant]] [[Premium]]

For the simple definition, the [[Premium|premium]] is the amount above the [[intrinsic]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp), or minimum value.

-   [[Premium]] = current price of the [[Warrant|warrant]] - minimum value
-   Minimum value = [[Exercise Price|exercise price]] - current price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]]

## Example of [[Warrant]] [[Premium]]

In this example, if the [[Warrant|warrant]] price is $10, the [[Exercise Price|exercise price]] is $25, and the current share cost is $30, then the warrant [[Premium|premium]] would be $10-( $30-$25) = $5.

For the second calculation, the [[Premium|premium]], expressed as a percentage, is the difference between buying [[Warrant|warrant]] [[Shares|shares]] vs. buying shares through the open market.

-   [[Premium]] = \[([[Warrant]] Price+[[Exercise Price]]-Current Share Price) / Current Share Price\] \* 100

For example, an investor holds a [[Warrant|warrant]] with a price of $10 and an [[Exercise Price|exercise price]] of $25. The current share price is $30. The warrant [[Premium|premium]] would be \[( $10+$25-$30) / $30\] \* 100 = 16.7%.

Warrants tend to trade at premiums because [[traders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) believe that the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] can increase in price. Therefore, the longer the time until expiration, the longer time the stock has to rise. However, as with [[options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), as expiration approaches the [[Premium|premium]] shrinks.

## Difference Between Options and Warrants

A [[Warrant|warrant]] is similar to an option. It gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy an [[underlying security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-[[Security|security]].asp) at a specific price, quantity, and at a future time. Warrants are unlike an option in that it is issued by a company, whereas an option is an instrument of the [[Stock|stock]] exchange. The security represented in the warrant, usually share [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp), is delivered by the issuing company instead of by an investor holding the [[Shares|shares]]. Traders cannot write warrants.

Companies [[Will|will]] often include warrants as part of a [[new-issue offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) to entice investors into buying the new [[Security|security]].
