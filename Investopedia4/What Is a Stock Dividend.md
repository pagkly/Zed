[[What Is a Stock Dividend]]?
## [[What Is a Stock Dividend]]?

A [[Stock|stock]] dividend is a dividend payment to shareholders that is made in [[Shares|shares]] rather than as cash. The stock dividend has the advantage of rewarding shareholders without reducing the company's cash balance, although it can [[dilute]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp) earnings per share.

These [[Stock|stock]] distributions are generally made as fractions paid per existing share. For example, a company might issue a stock dividend of 5%, which [[Will|will]] require it to issue 0.05 [[Shares|shares]] for every share owned by existing shareholders, so the owner of 100 shares would receive five additional shares.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Stock|stock]] dividend is a dividend paid to shareholders in the form of additional [[Shares|shares]] in the company, rather than as cash.
-   [[Stock]] dividends are not taxed until the [[Shares|shares]] granted are sold by their owner.
-   Like [[Stock|stock]] splits, stock dividends dilute the share price, but as with cash dividends, they also do not affect the value of the company.

## How a [[Stock]] Dividend Works

Also known as a "scrip dividend," a [[Stock|stock]] dividend is a distribution of [[Shares|shares]] to existing shareholders in lieu of a [[cash dividend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashdividend.asp). This type of dividend may be made when a company wants to reward its investors but doesn't have the spare cash or wants to preserve its cash for other investments.1

[[Stock]] dividends have a tax advantage for the investor. The share dividend, like any stock share, is not taxed until the investor sells it unless the company offers the option of taking the dividend as cash or in stock.1

A [[Stock|stock]] dividend may require that the newly received [[Shares|shares]] are not to be sold for a certain period of time. This [holding period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiod.asp) on a stock dividend typically begins the day after it is purchased. Understanding the holding period is important for determining [[Qualified Dividend|qualified dividend]] tax treatment.1

If a [[Stock|stock]] dividend has a cash-dividend option, taxes [[Will|will]] be due even if the owner does not sell the [[Shares|shares]].1

## Dilution Effect

The board of a public company, for example, may approve a 5% [[Stock|stock]] dividend. That gives existing investors an additional share of company stock for every 20 [[Shares|shares]] they already own. However, this means that the pool of available stock shares in the company increases by 5%, diluting the value of existing shares.

Therefore, in this example, an investor who owned 100 [[Shares|shares]] in a company [[Will|will]] own 105 shares once the dividend is executed. But the total [[market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp) of those shares remains the same. In this way, a [[Stock|stock]] dividend is similar to a [[stock split]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksplit.asp). This is not to say that the market value of the shares will stay the same. The incentive behind the stock dividend is the expectation that the share price will rise.

## Accounting for Small vs. Large [[Stock]] Dividends

When a [[Stock|stock]] dividend is issued, the total value of [[Equity|equity]] remains the same from both the investor's perspective and the company's perspective. However, all stock dividends require a [[Journal|journal]] entry for the company issuing the dividend. This entry transfers the value of the issued stock from the [[retained earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp) account to the [[paid-in capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paidincapital.asp) account.

The amount transferred between the two accounts depends on whether the dividend is a small [[Stock|stock]] dividend or a large stock dividend. A stock dividend is considered small if the [[Shares|shares]] issued are less than 25% of the total value of shares outstanding before the dividend. A [[Journal|journal]] entry for a small stock dividend transfers the market value of the issued shares from [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] to paid-in capital.

Large [[Stock|stock]] dividends are those in which the new [[Shares|shares]] issued are more than 25% of the value of the total shares outstanding prior to the dividend. In this case, the [[Journal|journal]] entry transfers the [[par value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) of the issued shares from [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] to paid-in capital.

## An Example of [[Stock]] Dividends

For example, if a company were to issue a 5% [[Stock|stock]] dividend, it would increase the number of [[Shares|shares]] held by shareholders by 5% (one share for every 20 owned). If there are one million shares in a company, this would translate into an additional 50,000 shares. If you owned 100 shares in the company, you'd receive five additional shares.

This, however, like the cash dividend, does not increase the value of the company. If the company was priced at $10 per share, the value of the company would be $10 million. After the [[Stock|stock]] dividend, the value [[Will|will]] remain the same, but the share price will decrease to $9.50 to adjust for the dividend [payout](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Payout|payout]].asp).
