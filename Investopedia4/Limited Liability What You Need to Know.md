Limited [[Liability]]: What You Need to Know
## What Is Limited [[Liability]]?

Limited [[Liability|liability]] is a type of legal structure for an organization where a corporate loss [[Will|will]] not exceed the amount invested in a partnership or [[limited liability company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp) (LLC). In other words, investors' and owners' private assets are not at [[Risk|risk]] if the company fails. In Germany, it's known as [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-gmbh/) (GmbH)_._

The limited [[Liability|liability]] feature is one of the biggest advantages of investing in publicly [[Listed|listed]] companies. While a [[shareholder]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) can participate wholly in the growth of a company, their [[liability]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp) is restricted to the amount of the investment in the company, even if it subsequently goes bankrupt and has remaining [[Debt|debt]] obligations.

### Key Takeaways

-   Limited [[Liability|liability]] is a legal structure of organizations that limit the extent of an economic loss to assets invested in the organization and that keeps the personal assets of investors and owners off-limits.
-   Without limited [[Liability|liability]] as a legal precedent, many investors would be reluctant to acquire [[Equity|equity]] ownership in firms and [[Entrepreneurs|entrepreneurs]] would be wary of undertaking a new venture.
-   Several limited [[Liability|liability]] structures exist, such as limited liability partnerships (LPs and LLPs), limited liability companies (LLCs), and corporations.

## How Limited [[Liability]] Works

When either an individual or a company functions with limited [[Liability|liability]] this means that assets attributed to the associated individuals cannot be seized in an effort to repay [[Debt|debt]] obligations attributed to the company. Funds that were directly invested with the company, such as with the purchase of company [[Stock|stock]], are considered assets of the company in question and can be seized in the event of [[insolvency]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insolvency.asp).

Any other assets deemed to be in the company’s possession, such as real [[Estate|estate]], equipment, and machinery, investments made in the name of the institution, and any goods that have been produced but have not been sold, are also subject to seizure and [[liquidation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp).

Without limited [[Liability|liability]] as a legal precedent, many investors would be reluctant to acquire [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) ownership in firms, and [[Entrepreneurs|entrepreneurs]] would be wary of undertaking a new venture. This is because without limited liability if the company loses more money than it has, [[creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) and other [[stakeholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stakeholder.asp) could claim the investors' and owners' assets. Limited liability prevents that from occurring, and so the most that can be lost is the amount invested, with any personal assets held as off-limits.

## Limited [[Liability]] Partnerships

In a partnership, the [[limited partners]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limited-partner.asp) (LPs) have limited [[Liability|liability]] while the [[general partner]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalpartner.asp) has unlimited liability. The limited liability feature protects the partner's personal assets from the [[Risk|risk]] of being seized to satisfy [[Creditor|creditor]] claims in the event of the company's or partnership's insolvency while the general partner’s [[Personal Property|personal property]] would remain at risk.

Another advantage of an LLP is the ability to bring partners in and let partners out. Because a partnership agreement exists for an LLP, partners can be added or retired as outlined by the agreement. This comes in handy as the LLP can always add partners who bring existing business with them. Usually, the decision to add new partners requires approval from all the existing partners.

Overall, it is the flexibility of an LLP for a certain type of professional that makes it a superior option to many other corporate entities. The LLP itself is a [[flow-through entity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flow-through.asp) for tax purposes, which is also an option for LLCs. With flow-through entities, the partners receive untaxed profits and must pay the taxes themselves. Both LLCs and LLPs are usually preferable to [[corporations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp), which are impacted by [[double taxation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double_taxation.asp) issues. [[Double Taxation|Double taxation]] occurs when the corporation must pay corporate income taxes, and then individuals must pay taxes again on their personal income from the company.

The actual details of a limited [[Liability|liability]] partnership depend on where it is created. In general, however, your personal assets as a partner [[Will|will]] be protected from legal action. Basically, the liability is limited in the sense that you will lose assets in the partnership, but not those assets outside of it (your personal assets). The partnership is the first target for any lawsuit, although a specific partner could be liable if they personally did something wrong.

## Limited [[Liability]] in Incorporated Businesses

In the context of a [[private company]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatecompany.asp), becoming incorporated can provide its owners with limited [[Liability|liability]] since an incorporated company is treated as a separate and independent legal entity. Limited liability is especially desirable when dealing in industries that can be subject to massive losses, such as [[insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp).

A limited [[Liability|liability]] company (LLC) is a corporate structure in the United States whereby the owners are not personally liable for the company's debts or liabilities. Limited liability companies are hybrid entities that combine the characteristics of a corporation with those of a partnership or [[sole proprietorship]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soleproprietorship.asp).

While the limited [[Liability|liability]] feature is similar to that of a corporation, the availability of flow-through [[Taxation|taxation]] to the members of an LLC is a feature of partnerships. The primary difference between a partnership and an LLC is that an LLC separates the business assets of the company from the personal assets of the owners, insulating the owners from the LLC's debts and liabilities.

As an example, consider the misfortune that befell numerous [[Lloyd's of London]] Names, who are private individuals that agree to take on unlimited liabilities related to insurance [[Risk|risk]] in [[Return|return]] for pocketing profits from [[insurance premiums]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-[[Premium|premium]].asp). In the late 1990s, hundreds of these investors had to declare [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) in the face of catastrophic losses incurred on claims related to asbestosis.

Contrast this with the losses incurred by shareholders in some of the biggest public companies that went bankrupt, such as [[Enron]](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/[[Enron|enron]]-scandal-summary/) and Lehman Brothers. Although shareholders in these companies lost all of their investments in them, they were not held liable for the hundreds of billions of dollars owed by these companies to their creditors subsequent to their bankruptcies.
