[[Negative Return]]
## What is a [[Negative Return]]

A [[Negative Return|negative return]] occurs when a company or business has a financial loss or lackluster returns on an [[investment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp) during a specific period of time. In other words, the business loses more money than it brings in and experiences a net loss. Some businesses report a negative [[Return|return]] during their early years because of the amount of capital that initially goes into the business to get it off the ground. Spending a lot of money/capital when not bringing in any revenue [[Will|will]] lead to a loss. New businesses generally do not begin making a profit until after a few years of being established.

A [[Negative Return|negative return]] can also be referred to as 'negative [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]]'.

[[Negative Return|Negative return]] can also be used to refer to the performance of a [[Stock|stock]] or bond. If the price of a stock drops below the price at which you purchased it as opposed to going up, that is known as a negative [[Return|return]].

## BREAKING DOWN [[Negative Return]]

A new business that has invested $500,000 in equipment, tools, repairs or any other operating expenses and is losing $50,000 annually [[Will|will]] have a [[Negative Return|negative return]] on capital of 10%. If the company is able to realize a [[return on equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) in the near future, then the impact of this initial negative [[Return|return]] can be overcome.

Investors in the company [[Will|will]] be willing to stick around if they know that the company has the potential to quickly turn its [[Negative Return|negative return]] into a positive [[Return|return]] and bring in high profits, sales or asset [[turnover]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/turnover.asp).

[[Stocks]] and other investments can also have a [[Negative Return|negative return]]. If an investor buys [[Stock|stock]] ABC at 4.50/share and holds the stock while it dips to 4.25/share, and if the stock did not pay a dividend, then the investor has experienced a negative [[Return|return]] on the stock.
