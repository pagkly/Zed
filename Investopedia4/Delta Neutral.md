[[Delta Neutral]]
## What Is [[Delta Neutral]]?

[[Delta Neutral|Delta neutral]] is a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] strategy utilizing multiple positions with balancing positive and negative [[deltas]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp) so that the overall delta of the assets in question totals zero.

A delta-[[Neutral|neutral]] [[Portfolio|portfolio]] evens out the response to market movements for a certain range to bring the [[net change]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netchange.asp) of the position to zero. Delta measures how much an option's price changes when the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]]'s price changes.

As the values of the [[Underlying|underlying]] assets change, the position of the [[Greeks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greeks.asp) [[Will|will]] shift between being positive, negative and [[Neutral|neutral]]. Investors who want to maintain delta neutrality must adjust their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Holdings|holdings]] accordingly. Options traders use delta-neutral strategies to profit either from [[implied volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp) or from time decay of the options. Delta-neutral strategies are also used for hedging purposes.

## Understanding [[Delta Neutral]]

### [[Delta Neutral]] Basic Mechanics

Long [[put options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) always have a delta ranging from -1 to 0, while long [[calls]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) always have a delta ranging from 0 to 1. The [[Underlying|underlying]] asset, typically a [[Stock|stock]] position, always has a delta of 1 if the position is a long position and -1 if the position is a short position. Given the underlying asset position, a trader or investor can use a combination of long and short calls and puts to make a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s effective delta 0.

If an option has a delta of one and the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] position increases by $1, the option's price [[Will|will]] also increase by $1. This behavior is seen with deep [[in-the-money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp) call options. Likewise, if an option has a delta of zero and the stock increases by $1, the option's price won't increase at all (a behavior seen with deep [[out-of-the-money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp) call options). If an option has a delta of 0.5, its price will increase $0.50 for every $1 increase in the underlying stock.

### An Example of Delta-[[Neutral]] Hedging

Assume you have a [[Stock|stock]] position that you believe [[Will|will]] increase in price in the [[Long Term|long term]]. You are worried, however, that prices could decline in the short term, so you decide to set up a [[Delta Neutral|delta neutral]] position.

Assume that you own 200 [[Shares|shares]] of Company X, which is trading at $100 per share. Since the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]]'s delta is 1, your current position has a delta of positive 200 (the delta multiplied by the number of shares).

To obtain a delta-[[Neutral|neutral]] position, you need to enter into a position that has a total delta of -200. Assume then you find [[at-the-money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp) put options on Company X that are trading with a delta of -0.5.

You could purchase 4 of these put options, which would have a total delta of (400 x -0.5), or -200. With this combined position of 200 Company X [[Shares|shares]] and 4 long at-the-money put options on Company X, your overall position is [[Delta Neutral|delta neutral]].
