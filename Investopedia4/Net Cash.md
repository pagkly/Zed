[[Net Cash]]
## What Is [[Net Cash]]?

[[Net Cash|Net cash]] is a figure that is reported on a company's financial statements. It is calculated by subtracting a company's total liabilities from its total [[cash]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash.asp). The net cash figure is commonly used when evaluating a company's [[cash flows]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp). Net cash may also refer to the amount of cash remaining after a transaction has been completed and all associated charges and deductions have been subtracted.

## Understanding [[Net Cash]]

Similar to the [[current ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp), [[Net Cash|net cash]] is a measure of a company's [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp)—or its ability to quickly meet its financial [[obligations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp). A company's financial obligations can include standard operating costs, payments on debts, or investment activities.

In order to calculate [[Net Cash|net cash]], you must first add up all cash (not credit) receipts for a period. This amount is often referred to as "gross cash." Once totaled, cash outflows paid out for obligations and liabilities are deducted from gross cash; the difference is net cash.

When [[Net Cash|net cash]] is used in relation to [[Stock|stock]] investing, it sometimes refers to an abbreviated version of the term "net cash per share." Investors can use net cash to help determine whether a company's stock is an attractive investment.

## [[Net Cash]] vs. Net [[Cash Flow]]

Net [[cash flow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) refers to either the [[Gain|gain]] or loss of funds over a period (after all [[debts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debt|debt]].asp) have been paid). When a business has a [[Surplus|surplus]] of cash after paying all its operating costs, it is said to have a positive [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]. If the company is paying more for obligations and liabilities than what it earns through operations, it is said to have a negative cash flow.

A negative [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] does not mean a company is unable to pay all of its obligations; it just means that the amount of cash received for that period was insufficient to cover its obligations for that same time period. If other savings vehicles are [[liquidated]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidate|liquidate]].asp) to meet the obligation—or additional [[Debt|debt]] is accrued that does not involve the receipt of a lump sum deposit—a company can meet all of its obligations while maintaining a negative cash flow.

Analyzing what activities contribute to positive or negative [[Net Cash|net cash]] is essential when using net cash as a barometer for determining the financial health of a company. Positive net cash from events such as increased profits from sales, or reduced obligations, can be indicative of a well-functioning, healthy firm. However, certain activities may result in a positive [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] that may not reflect positively on a company’s financial health, such as money received as a result of incurring a new [[Debt|debt]] or activities associated with a lump-sum [[Loan|loan]] deposit.
