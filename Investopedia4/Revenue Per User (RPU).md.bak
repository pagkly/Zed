## DEFINITION of [[Revenue Per User (RPU)]]

[[Social Media|Social media]] sites that allow free access also use the revenue per user ratio. Since free social media sites generate revenue through ad sales, more users equal more foot traffic to their sites which equates to higher revenues from ad space.
