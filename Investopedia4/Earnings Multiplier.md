[[Earnings Multiplier]]
## What Is the [[Earnings Multiplier]]?

The [[Earnings Multiplier|earnings multiplier]] is a financial metric that frames a company's current [[Stock|stock]] price in terms of the company's [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS) of stock, that's simply computed as price per share/earnings per share. Also known as the [[price-to-earnings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) (P/E) ratio, the earnings multiplier can be used as a simplified [[valuation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp) tool with which to compare the relative costliness of the [[Stocks|stocks]] of similar companies. It can likewise help investors judge current stock prices against their historical prices on an earnings-relative basis.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Earnings Multiplier|earnings multiplier]] frames a company's current [[Stock|stock]] price in terms of the company's [[Earnings Per Share (EPS)|earnings per share (EPS)]] of stock.
-   This metric is computed as price per share/earnings per share. 
-   The [[Earnings Multiplier|earnings multiplier]] can help investors determine how expensive the current price of a [[Stock|stock]] is relative to the company's earnings per share of that stock.

## Understanding [[Earnings Multiplier]]

The [[Earnings Multiplier|earnings multiplier]] can be a useful tool for determining how expensive the current price of a [[Stock|stock]] is relative to the company's earnings per share of that stock. This is an important relationship because the price of a stock is theoretically supposed to be a function of the anticipated [[future value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurevalue.asp) of the issuing company and future cash flows resulting from ownership of that stock. If the price of a stock is historically expensive relative to the company's earnings, it may indicate that it's not an optimal time to purchase this [[Equity|equity]] because it's overly expensive. Furthermore, comparing earnings multipliers across similar companies can help illustrate how expensive various companies' stock prices are relative to one other.

## Example of the [[Earnings Multiplier]]

As an example of a practical application of the [[Earnings Multiplier|earnings multiplier]], consider fictitious company ABC. Let's assume this corporation has a current [[Stock|stock]] price of $50 per share and [[Earnings Per Share (EPS)|earnings per share (EPS)]] of $5. Under this set of circumstances, the earnings multiplier would be 50 dollars/5 dollars per year = 10 years. This means it would take 10 years to make back the stock price of $50 given the current EPS.

The multiplier can also be verbally expressed by saying, "Company ABC is trading at 10 times earnings," because the current price of $50 is 10x the $5 EPS. If 10 years ago, company ABC had a market price of $50 and EPS of $7, the multiplier would have been 7.14 years.

The [[Earnings Multiplier|earnings multiplier]] should only be used to value investments on a relative basis and shouldn't be used to gauge an absolute valuation of a [[Stock|stock]].

The current price would be more expensive relative to current earnings than the price 10 years ago because, at that time, the [[Stock|stock]] was only trading at 7.14 times earnings instead of 10 times earnings it trades at currently. 

Comparing company ABC's [[Earnings Multiplier|earnings multiplier]] to other similar companies can also provide a simple gauge for judging how expensive a [[Stock|stock]] is relative to its earnings. If company XYZ also has an EPS of $5, but its current stock price is $65, it has an earnings multiplier of 13 years. Consequently, this stock may be deemed to be relatively more expensive than the stock of company ABC, which has a multiplier of only 10 years.
