[[What Is Word-of-Mouth Marketing]]?
## [[What Is Word-of-Mouth Marketing]]?

Word-of-mouth marketing (WOM marketing) is when a consumer's interest in a company's product or service is reflected in their daily dialogues. Essentially, is it is free advertising triggered by customer experiences—and usually, something that goes beyond what they expected. Word-of-mouth [[marketing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp) can be encouraged through different publicity activities set up by companies, or by having opportunities to encourage consumer-to-consumer and consumer-to-marketer communications. Also called referred to as "WOMM" or "word-of-mouth advertising," WOM marketing includes buzz, viral, blog, emotional, and [[social media marketing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-media-marketing-smm.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   WOM marketing is one of the most powerful forms of advertising as 92% of consumers trust their friends over traditional media.
-   Companies can encourage WOM marketing through exceeding expectations on a product, providing good customer service, and giving exclusive information to consumers.

## Understanding Word-of-Mouth Marketing

Word-of-mouth marketing differs from natural word-of-mouth references to a company's products and services in how it may come as the result of a promotion, encouragement, or other influence by a company, otherwise known as "seeding." When a diner has a wonderful time at a restaurant because their expectations were exceeded and later tells tweets about it, or when someone had a great experience using a product in a new way and tells everyone they know about it, those are examples of word-of-mouth marketing. Also, word-of-mouth marketing does not stop at the first interaction; it tends to lead to a cascade of follow-on interactions.

The encouragement on the part of a company may take one of several forms. The best way is to give them a reason to talk, such as exceeding expectations or providing insider skills or information about a product. Other strategies include [[Offering|offering]] consumers new ways to share information about a company's products and services, and engaging and interacting with the consumer, such as through exemplary customer service. This is especially valuable with [[Social Media|social media]]-based [[customer service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer-service.asp), which provides for seamless sharing and promotion.

## Advantages of Word-of-Mouth Marketing

[According to Nielsen](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2012/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html), 92% of people around the world said they trust recommendations from friends and family (earned media) above all other forms of advertising.

Consumers are more emotionally bonded to a company when they feel they are listened to by the company. That is why many companies [[Will|will]] have sales representatives discuss their products and services with consumers personally or through a feedback phone line. This kind of interaction, as well as promotional events, can stimulate conversations about a company's product.

There is a significant temptation to fabricate word-of-mouth marketing. Accordingly, the [Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA)](http://womma.org/) has crafted a code of ethics for the industry, the best word-of-mouth marketing strategies are "credible, social, repeatable, measurable, and respectful" and there is no excuse for dishonesty. WOM marketing expert [Andy Sernovitz](http://wordofmouthbook.com/) has boiled down WOMMA's code of ethics into [three key rules to avoid issues](http://wordofmouthbook.com/download/ethics-checklist.pdf):

-   Say who you are representing (always disclose a relationship)
-   Say only what you believe (be honest with an opinion)
-   Never lie about who you are (be honest about your identity)
