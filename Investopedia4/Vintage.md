[[Vintage]]
## What Is [[Vintage]]?

[[Vintage]] is a slang term used by [[mortgage-backed security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp) (MBS) traders and investors to refer to an MBS that is seasoned over some time period. An MBS typically has a [[maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp) of around 30 years, and a particular issue's "vintage" exposes the holder to less prepayment and [[Default Risk|default risk]], although this decreased [[Risk|risk]] also limits price appreciation.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Vintage]] is a colloquial term used to describe mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that have been "seasoned."
-   That is, they've been issued long enough, and enough on-time payments have been made, that the [[Risk|risk]] of [[Default|default]] is lower.
-   [[Vintage]] is the age of an item as it relates to the year it was created. It's a way to assess the inherent [[Risk|risk]] of an MBS.
-   Two MBS with the same [[Vintage|vintage]] may have different levels of assumed [[Risk|risk]], however, and as a result, different perceived values.

## How [[Vintage]] Works

The [[Underlying|underlying]] loans of certain [[Vintage|vintage]] MBS have unique characteristics, such as [[burnout]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/burnout.asp), that make the vintage trade at a [[Premium|premium]] price. These unique characteristics are a result of how underlying assets in MBS are pooled. MBS' underlying assets are generally grouped across certain geographical regions with similar terms to [[maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp) and interest rates. This makes forecasting payment plans more predictable.

MBS are [[investment vehicles]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentvehicle.asp) predominantly issued by a U.S. [[government-sponsored enterprise]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp) (GSE). The investments are comprised of the [[Debt|debt]] obligations associated with groups of mortgage loans, predominantly residential property loans. The [[Security|security]], representing a particular claim against the [[Principal|principal]] and interest payments owed by borrowers, is then issued by the creating entity.

## [[Vintage]] as Applied to MBS

The term [[Vintage|vintage]] relates to the age of an item as it relates to the year it was created. If an item was created in 2012, then the [[vintage year]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vintage_year.asp) is 2012, and its age can be determined by subtracting the [[Vintage Year|vintage year]] from the current year.

The variation in the vintages of particular MBS may represent different levels of [[Risk|risk]] to investors. With the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that began in 2007, for example, lenders had started originating large numbers of high-risk mortgages from around 2004 to 2007. Loans from those [[Vintage|vintage]] years displayed higher [[default rates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrate.asp), and were, therefore, riskier, than loans made before and after.

## Special Considerations

While the [[Vintage|vintage]] may be one factor used to determine the [[inherent risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inherent-[[Risk|risk]].asp) of a certain MBS, other factors are also considered. In this case, two MBS with the same vintage may have different levels of assumed risk and, therefore, may have different [[perceived values]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perceived-value.asp). Some additional factors include the remaining value of the mortgage pool, the current market value of the properties backing the mortgages and the accrued interest.

An MBS [[payout]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Payout|payout]].asp) schedule varies from many other investment vehicles. While bonds may pay semiannually, annually or at the previously agreed-upon [[maturity date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), an MBS pays out to investors on a monthly basis. While a bond payment may only include the earned interest until the maturity date, where a lump sum of the original [[Principal|principal]] is returned, MBS provide monthly payments of both interest and a portion of the principal. The monthly payment required correlates to the traditional payment schedule of mortgage debtors.
