[[Paid-Up Capital]]
## What Is [[Paid-Up Capital]]?

[[Paid-Up Capital|Paid-up capital]] is the amount of money a company has received from shareholders in exchange for [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock|stock]]. Paid-up capital is created when a company sells its shares on the [[primary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarymarket.asp) directly to investors, usually through an initial public [[Offering|offering]] (IPO). When shares are bought and sold among investors on the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp), no additional paid-up capital is created as proceeds in those transactions go to the selling shareholders, not the issuing company.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Paid-Up Capital|Paid-up capital]] is money that a company receives from selling [[Stock|stock]] directly to investors.
-   The primary market is the only place where [[Paid-Up Capital|paid-up capital]] is received, usually through an initial public [[Offering|offering]].
-   Funding for [[Paid-Up Capital|paid-up capital]] is arrived at from two sources: the par value of [[Stock|stock]] and excess capital.
-   [[Paid-Up Capital|Paid-up capital]] is the amount paid by investors above the par value of a [[Stock|stock]].
-   [[Equity]] financing is represented by [[Paid-Up Capital|paid-up capital]].

## Understanding [[Paid-Up Capital]]

[[Paid-Up Capital|Paid-up capital]], also called paid-in capital or [[contributed capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contributed-capital.asp), is arrived at from two funding sources: the [[par value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) of [[Stock|stock]] and excess capital. Each share of stock is issued with a base price, called its par. Typically, this value is quite low, often less than $1. Any amount paid by investors that exceeds the par value is considered additional paid-in capital, or paid-in capital in excess of par. On the balance sheet, the par value of issued [[Shares|shares]] is [[Listed|listed]] as [[Common Stock|common stock]] or [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] under the shareholder [[Equity|equity]] section.

For example, if a company issues 100 [[Shares|shares]] of [[Common Stock|common stock]] with a par value of $1 and sells them for $50 each, the shareholders' [[Equity|equity]] of the balance sheet shows [[Paid-Up Capital|paid-up capital]] totaling $5,000, consisting of $100 of common [[Stock|stock]] and $4,900 of additional paid-up capital.

## [[Paid-Up Capital]] vs. Authorized Capital

When a company wants to raise [[Equity|equity]], it cannot simply sell off pieces of the company to the highest bidder. Businesses must request permission to issue public [[Shares|shares]] by filing an application with the agency responsible for the registration of companies in the country of incorporation. In the United States, companies wanting to "go public" must register with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) before issuing an [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO).

The maximum amount of capital a company is given permission to raise via the sale of [[Stock|stock]] is called its [[authorized capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorized-share-capital.asp). Typically, the amount of authorized capital a company applies for is much higher than its current need. This is done so that the company can easily sell additional [[Shares|shares]] down the road if the need for further [[Equity|equity]] arises. Since [[Paid-Up Capital|paid-up capital]] is only generated by the sale of shares, the amount of paid-up capital can never exceed the authorized capital.

## Importance of [[Paid-Up Capital]]

[[Paid-Up Capital|Paid-up capital]] represents money that is not borrowed. A company that is fully paid-up has sold all available [[Shares|shares]] and thus cannot increase its capital unless it borrows money by taking on [[Debt|debt]]. A company could, however, receive authorization to sell more shares.

A company's [[Paid-Up Capital|paid-up capital]] figure represents the extent to which it depends on [[equity financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityfinancing.asp) to fund its operations. This figure can be compared with the company's level of [[Debt|debt]] to assess if it has a healthy balance of financing, given its operations, business model, and prevailing industry standards.
