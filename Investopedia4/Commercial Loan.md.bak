[[Commercial Loan]]
## What Is a [[Commercial Loan]]?

A [[Commercial Loan|commercial loan]] is a [[Debt|debt]]-based funding arrangement between a business and a financial institution such as a bank. It is typically used to fund major [[capital expenditures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) and/or cover operational costs that the company may otherwise be unable to afford. Expensive upfront costs and regulatory hurdles often prevent small businesses from having direct access to bond and [[Equity|equity]] markets for financing. This means that, not unlike individual consumers, smaller businesses must rely on other lending products, such as [[lines of credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lineofcredit.asp), [[Unsecured|unsecured]] loans or [[term loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termloan.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Commercial Loan|commercial loan]] is done between a bank and a business, used to fund operating costs and capital expenditures. 
-   Many commercial loans require [[Collateral|collateral]], such as property or equipment. 
-   Companies generally have to provide financial statements to prove their ability to repay. 
-   Although most commercial loans are short-term, they can be “rolled,” or renewed to extend the life of the [[Loan|loan]].

## How Commercial Loans Work

Commercial loans are granted to a variety of business entities, usually to assist with short-term funding needs for operational costs or for the purchase of equipment to facilitate the operating process. In some instances, the [[Loan|loan]] may be extended to help the business meet more basic operational needs, such as funding for [[Payroll|payroll]] or to purchase supplies used in the production and [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] process.

These loans often require that a business posts [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp), usually in the form of property, plant or equipment that the bank can confiscate from the borrower in the event of [[default]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) or bankruptcy. Sometimes cash flows generated from future [[accounts receivable]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp) are used as a [[Loan|loan]]'s collateral. Mortgages issued to commercial real [[Estate|estate]] are one form of [[Commercial Loan|commercial loan]].

Commercial loans are most often used for short-term funding needs.

## Special Considerations 

As is true for nearly every type of [[Loan|loan]], the [[creditworthiness]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp) of an applicant plays a starring role when a financial institution considers giving out a [[Commercial Loan|commercial loan]]. In most cases, the business applying for the loan [[Will|will]] be required to present documentation—generally in the form of balance sheets and other similar documents—that proves the company has a favorable and consistent [[Cash Flow|cash flow]]. This assures the [[Lender|lender]] that the loan can and will be repaid according to its terms.

If a company is approved for a [[Commercial Loan|commercial loan]], it can expect to pay a rate of interest that falls in line with the prime lending rate at the time the [[Loan|loan]] is issued. Banks typically require monthly [[financial statements]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp) from the company through the duration of the loan and often require the company to take out insurance on any larger items purchased with funds from the loan.

## Types of Commercial Loans

While a [[Commercial Loan|commercial loan]] is most often thought of as a short-term source of funds for a business, there are some banks or other financial institutions that [[Offer|offer]] renewable loans that can extend indefinitely. This allows the business to get the funds it needs to maintain ongoing operations and to repay the first [[Loan|loan]] within its specified time period.

After this, the [[Loan|loan]] may be rolled into an additional or "renewed" loan period. A business [[Will|will]] often seek a renewable [[Commercial Loan|commercial loan]] when it must obtain the resources it needs to handle large seasonal orders from certain customers while still being able to provide goods to additional clients.
