[[Vancouver Stock Exchange (VAN) Definition]]
## What Is the Vancouver [[Stock]] Exchange (VAN)?

The Vancouver [[Stock]] Exchange (VAN/VSE) is a now-defunct stock exchange formerly located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was incorporated in 1907 as the third-largest marketplace in Canada behind the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/toronto-stock-exchange-tsx.asp) (TSX) and [[Montreal Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montrealexchange.asp). [[Stocks]] [[Listed|listed]] on this exchange were denoted by a .V following the ticker symbol.

### Key Takeaways

-   The Vancouver [[Stock]] Exchange (VAN) is a now-defunct Canadian stock exchange, founded in 1903 and located in Vancouver.
-   The exchange specialized in smaller and riskier listings, primarily among [[Mining|mining]] and oil exploration companies based in Canada, some of which proved to be fraudulent.
-   In 1999, it was incorporated into the new TSX Venture exchange, resulting from a merger between the Vancouver and Alberta [[Stock|stock]] exchanges.

## Understanding the Vancouver [[Stock]] Exchange (VAN)

The Vancouver exchange originally featured primarily small-capitalization [[Mining|mining]], oil, and gas exploration [[Stocks|stocks]]. By the early 1990s, however, the Vancouver exchange had grown into a specialty market for venture capital securities. Today, the Vancouver [[Stock]] Exchange falls under the [[TSX Venture Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tsxventureexchange.asp) umbrella after a merger with the Canadian Venture Exchange in 1999.

The Vancouver [[Stock]] Exchange was recognized as the home for venture capital solutions but many saw through the facade and quickly labeled it the "scam capital of the world." At one point the VAN [[Listed|listed]] about 2,300 [[Stocks|stocks]], many of which were considered total failures or frauds.1 The exchange provides a textbook example of how errors in floating-point calculations can lead to enormous discrepancies in the correctness of the index reading. Ultimately, however, the VAN is an example of one of the world's least successful stock exchanges as it was mostly known for low volumes and speculative listings.

Still, the Vancouver [[Stock]] Exchange managed to reemerge throughout the market turmoil of the [[dotcom bubble]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp), and in 1999 it merged with the Alberta Stock Exchange and Bourse de Montreal to become part of the Canadian Venture Exchange, now known as the TSX Venture Exchange.

The trading floor of the Vancouver exchange remained the center of the new venture division, but that only lasted for two years. In 2001, TMX Group—the parent company of the Toronto [[Stock]] Exchange—purchased the newly formed marketplace and quickly renamed it. Today, the TSX Venture Exchange is headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, with offices in other major cities throughout Canada. All trading is executed electronically so a trading floor no longer exists.

## The TSX Venture Exchange at a Glance

Today, the Toronto Venture Exchange is considered a leader in global benchmarks and venture capital listings despite its previous reputation. The strength of the Toronto [[Stock]] Exchange and Venture Exchange now stretches to about $3.2 trillion in [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]]. The venture division alone offers solutions to 1,673 companies with a total market value of about $45 billion.2

Trading on the exchange is comparable with most other major exchanges. There are slightly different order types, rules, regulations, and services that keep the exchange operating smoothly. Some of those orders include traditional limit and market orders to more unfamiliar dark order types. Companies [[Listed|listed]] on the exchange are subject to various fees like initial application, registration, and monthly costs.
