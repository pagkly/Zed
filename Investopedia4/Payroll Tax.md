[[Payroll Tax]]
## What Is a [[Payroll Tax]]?

A [[Payroll Tax|payroll tax]] is a percentage withheld from an employee's pay by an employer who pays it to the government on the employee's behalf. The tax is based on [[wages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wage-expense.asp), salaries, and tips paid to employees. Federal [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes are deducted directly from the employee's earnings and paid to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

In the U.S., the term federal [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes refers to the taxes deducted to fund Medicare and [[Social Security]] programs. These are labeled as MedFICA and FICA on pay stubs. Federal income tax, which also is withheld from employee paychecks, goes into the general fund of the U.S. Treasury.

Most states and [[some cities and counties]](https://www.thebalance.com/cities-that-levy-income-taxes-3193246) impose income taxes as well, and these amounts are paid directly to their coffers. In addition, employers, but not employees, also pay federal [[Unemployment|unemployment]] taxes for each of their employees.1

Unlike the U.S. income tax, which is a [progressive tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp), some elements of [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes are levied only up to a certain yearly limit. For example, any income that exceeds the [[Social Security]] wage base, set at $137,700 in 2020, is not subject to Social [[Security]] tax, making the U.S. [[Payroll Tax|payroll tax]] a [regressive tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regressivetax.asp).2

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Payroll]] taxes are withheld from every employee's salary and remitted to the federal government.
-   In the U.S., [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes are used to fund [[Social Security]] and Medicare.
-   [[Payroll]] taxes are used for specific programs. Income taxes go into the government's general fund.
-   An [[executive order]](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-signs-coronavirus-relief-orders-after-congress-talks-stumble-5074359) issued by President Trump in August 2020 deferred [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes from Sept. 1 through Dec. 31, 2020, for Americans earning less than $100,000 per year.

## Understanding [[Payroll]] Taxes

[[Payroll]] taxes in addition to income taxes are collected by federal authorities and some state governments in many countries, including the United States. These [[Payroll Tax|payroll tax]] deductions are itemized on [[an employee's pay stub]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020414/how-long-should-i-keep-my-tax-records.asp). The itemized list notes how much is withheld for federal, state, and municipal income taxes as well as the amounts collected for Medicare and [[Social Security]] payments.

Governments use revenues from [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes to fund specific programs including [[Social Security]], healthcare, and [[Workers' Compensation|workers' compensation]]. Local governments may collect a relatively small [[Payroll Tax|payroll tax]] to maintain and improve local infrastructure and services, including first responders, road maintenance, and parks.

### [[Unemployment]] Taxes

Employers bear the primary responsibility for funding [[Unemployment Insurance|unemployment insurance]]. If they lay off employees, those employees are entitled to [[Unemployment|unemployment]] benefits. The rate of unemployment insurance the employer [[Will|will]] pay varies by industry, state, and federal fees. Some states require employees to contribute to unemployment and disability insurance.

Federal [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes cover [[Social Security]] and Medicare contributions, which constitute the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax. An employee pays 7.65%.3 This rate is divided between a 6.2% deduction for Social [[Security]] on a maximum salary of $137,700 and a 1.45% share for Medicare.4

There is no salary limit on Medicare, but anyone who earns more than $200,000—or $250,000 for married couples filing jointly—pays another 0.9% for Medicare.5

The premise of [[Social Security]] and [[Medicare]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp) is that you pay into them during your working years in order to qualify to withdraw these funds after retiring or under certain medical circumstances.

Employees pay 6.2% into [[Social Security]] for the first $137,700 earned in 2020 and $142,800 in 2021, and another 1.45% into Medicare on all wages.6

## Special Considerations

Self-employed individuals including contractors, freelance writers, musicians, and small business owners are also required to remit [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes. These are referred to as [[self-employment taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/selfemploymenttax.asp).

Unlike most salaried workers, people who are self-employed don't have employers to remit [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes on their behalf. This means they must cover both the employer and employee portions of the tax on their own.

The [[Self-Employment|self-employment]] tax rate is 15.3%. There are two parts to this rate including a 12.4% contribution to [[Social Security]]—old-age, survivors, and disability insurance—and a 2.9% payment to Medicare. Another 0.9% surtax for Medicare applies to self-employment earnings that exceed $200,000.7

### [[Social Security]] [[Payroll Tax]]

Funds paid to [[Social Security]] taxes go into two trust funds: the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI), which pays retirement and survivor benefits, and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, for disability benefits. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Social [[Security]], and two public trustees manage these trust funds. 

President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the [[Social Security]] Act into law on Aug. 14, 1935, to provide a safety net for the disabled and retirees. When the program was conceived, high-wage earners were exempt from paying into the fund and from receiving Social [[Security]] benefits. But that exemption was eliminated and replaced with a cap by Congress which has continued to rise roughly at the same rate as wages.

### Medicare [[Payroll Tax]]

As noted above, [[Payroll|payroll]] taxes also go toward Medicare. These payroll deductions go into two separate trust funds: the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.

-   The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund pays for Medicare Part A and the associated administration fees. Part A assists in covering hospital care, skilled nursing inpatient care, and, in some cases, home care.
-   The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund assists in paying for Medicare Parts B and D and other Medicare program administration costs. Part B covers laboratory tests and screenings, outpatient care, x-rays, ambulance service, and many other costs. Part D helps with prescription drugs.

Individuals enrolled in Medicare pay a monthly income-based fee for basic Medicare coverage and are responsible for a portion of their medical costs.

## [[Payroll]] Taxes vs. Income Taxes

There is a distinction between a [[Payroll Tax|payroll tax]] and an income tax, although both are deducted from paychecks. [[Payroll]] taxes are used to fund specific programs. Income taxes go into the general funds at the U.S. Treasury.

Everyone pays a flat [[Payroll Tax|payroll tax]] rate, up to a yearly cap. Income taxes, however, are progressive. Rates vary based on an individual's earnings.

State income tax, if any, goes into the state's treasury.
