[[Leveraged Buyback]]
## What Is a [[Leveraged Buyback]]?

A [[Leveraged Buyback|leveraged buyback]], also known as a leveraged [[share repurchase]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharerepurchase.asp), is a corporate [[Finance|finance]] transaction that enables a company to repurchase some of its [[Shares|shares]] using [[Debt|debt]]. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, it increases the remaining owners' respective shares.

Leveraged buybacks have similar impacts to [[leveraged recapitalizations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedrecapitalization.asp) and [[dividend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedrecapitalization.asp) [[recapitalizations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendrecap.asp), in which companies employ [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp) to pay a one-time dividend. The difference is that dividend recapitalizations do not change the ownership structure.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Leveraged Buyback|leveraged buyback]] is a financial transaction that lets a company repurchase some of its [[Stock|stock]] by using [[Debt|debt]]. 
-   The process boosts the remaining owners' [[Shares|shares]] by limiting the number of shares that are outstanding.
-   Companies sometimes use leveraged buybacks to protect themselves from hostile takeovers by having extra [[Debt|debt]] on their balance sheets.
-   More often the purpose of these kinds of buybacks is to increase [[Earnings Per Share (EPS)|earnings per share (EPS)]] and improve other financial metrics.

## How a [[Leveraged Buyback]] Works

Leveraged buybacks should, theoretically, have no immediate impact on a company's share price, net of any tax benefits from the new capital structure, and higher interest payments. But the extra [[Debt|debt]] provides an incentive for management to be more disciplined and improve operational efficiency through cost-cutting and downsizing, in order to meet larger interest and [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) payments; a justification for the extreme levels of debt in [[leveraged buyouts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp).

Leveraged buybacks are sometimes used by companies with excess cash to decapitalize their balance sheets to avoid [[overcapitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/[[Overcapitalization|overcapitalization]].asp). Increasing the [[Debt|debt]] on the balance sheet can provide [[shark repellant]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharkrepellent.asp) protection from [[hostile takeovers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hostiletakeover.asp).

The use of leveraged buybacks, particularly to improve EPS and other financial metrics, increased significantly in the aftermath of the 2008 [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]].

But more often than not, leveraged buybacks, like other share repurchases, are simply used to increase [[earnings per share]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS), [[return on equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp), and [[price-to-book ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp).

## Leveraged Buybacks and EPS

Boosting EPS through leveraged buybacks can be an effective tool for companies to use, but it does not signify an improvement in [[Underlying|underlying]] performance or value. It can even do damage to the business if financial engineering comes at the expense of not investing capital productively for the [[Long Term|long term]]. Executives say there are not enough investment opportunities. But there is clearly a big conflict of interest, given that executive compensation is linked to EPS in most American companies.

Financial markets have rewarded companies using buybacks as a substitute for improving operational performance. So it is no wonder that buybacks have become one of Wall Streets' favorite tools since the global [[financial crisis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp).

Buybacks are a mixed bag, they can increase earnings-per-share and improve other financial metrics but also put a firm's credit ratings at [[Risk|risk]].

Between 2008 and 2018, companies in the United States spent over $5 trillion buying back their own [[Stock|stock]], or over half their profits.1 And for such large companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Mondelez, and Eli Lilly, approximately 40% of EPS growth has been a result of buybacks.2

## [[Leveraged Buyback]] Returns

Leveraged buybacks have made a big comeback in the U.S., where share repurchases have exceeded free [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] since 2014.3 They can also be used to avoid having to repatriate cash and pay U.S. taxes.

The buyback boom has increased the [[Risk|risk]] for both bondholders and shareholders. Even investment-grade companies have been willing to sacrifice their [[credit ratings]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/102203.asp) in order to reduce the number of [[Shares|shares]]. For example, McDonald’s, whose executives depend on EPS metrics as a component of their performance incentive [[Payout|payout]], had borrowed so heavily to fund buybacks that its credit [[Rating|rating]] fell from A to BBB between 2016 and 2018.4 5

Rising interest rates could choke off this boom in leveraged buybacks. But so could politicians. Senate Democrats have strongly criticized the buyback boom, arguing that [[Trump's tax reform]](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/) isn't trickling down to workers.6 They want to regulate buybacks, which were seen as a form of market manipulation before the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) gave them the green light in 1982 when it adopted [[Rule 10b-18]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule10b18.asp).7 This protects corporations from charges of [[Stock|stock]] market manipulation if buybacks on any given day are no more than 25% of the previous four weeks’ average daily trading volume.8
