[[Oversubscribed]]
## What Is [[Oversubscribed]]?

[[Oversubscribed]] is a term used for when the demand for a [[New Issue|new issue]] of securities, such as an IPO's [[Shares|shares]], is greater than the number of securities offered. When a [[new issue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/newissue.asp) is oversubscribed, underwriters or other financial entities [[Offering|offering]] the [[Security|security]] can adjust the price upward or [[Offer|offer]] more securities to reflect the higher-than-anticipated demand.

[[Oversubscribed]] can be contrasted with an [[undersubscribed]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undersubscribed.asp) issue, where demand cannot fully meet the available [[Supply|supply]].

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Oversubscribed]] refers to an issue of securities where demand exceeds the available [[Supply|supply]].
-   An [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] IPO is indicates that investors are eager to buy the company's [[Shares|shares]], leading to a higher IPO price and/or more shares offered for sale.
-   An [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] issue does not always mean the market [[Will|will]] support the higher price for long, as the demand must eventually reconcile with the [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]].

## Understanding [[Oversubscribed]] Issues

An [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] [[Security|security]] [[Offering|offering]] often occurs when the interest for it far exceeds the available [[Supply|supply]] of the issue. Over-subscription can happen in any market where the available supply of new securities is limited, but is most often associated with the sale of newly minted [[Shares|shares]] in the secondary market via an [[initial public offering (IPO)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp), Here the demand exceeds the total number of shares issued by the IPO'ing company. The degree of oversubscription is shown as a multiple, such as "ABC IPO oversubscribed two times." A two-times multiple means there is effectively twice as much demand for shares as there are available in the scheduled issue.

Share prices are intentionally set at a level that [[Will|will]] ideally sell all [[Shares|shares]]. The [[underwriters]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp) of an IPO generally do not want to be left [[eating stock]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/082100.asp) with an undersubscribed issue. If there is more demand for an IPO than there is [[Supply|supply]] (creating a shortage), a higher price can be charged for the securities resulting in more capital raised for the issuer, which also means more fees earned for the underwriter. However, [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] IPO shares are often [[underpriced]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underpricing.asp) to some extent to allow for a post-IPO pop and [[Robust|robust]] trading to continue to generate excitement around the issue. Companies leave a bit of capital on the table, but may still please the internal stockholders by giving them a paper [[Gain|gain]] even if they are stuck in a lock-up period.

## Benefits and Costs of [[Oversubscribed]] Securities

When securities are [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]], companies can [[Offer|offer]] more of the securities, raise the price of the [[Security|security]], or partake in some combination of the two to meet demand and raise more capital in the process. This means that they can raise more capital and at better terms.

Companies [[Will|will]] almost always [[Hold|hold]] back a significant portion of their [[Shares|shares]] to allow for future capital needs and management incentives, so there is usually a standing reserve of shares that can be added if an IPO is looking to be badly [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] without having to register new securities with regulators.

More capital is good for a company, of course. Investors, however, have to pay higher prices and may get priced out of the issue if the price rises above their willingness to pay. It may also hurt investors who herd into a [[hot IPO]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hotipo.asp) that drives the initial market price far above [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]], only to see a collapse in price over the following weeks and months.

## Example of an [[Oversubscribed]] IPO

In early 2012, [[analysts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst.asp) indicated that the then long-awaited Facebook (FB) IPO, which initially sought to raise about $10.6 billion by selling around 337 million [[Shares|shares]] at $28 to $35 per share, would generate far more interest from investors such that it might quickly become an [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] IPO. As predicted, investor interest leading up to the IPO on May 18, 2012, produced far more demand for Facebook shares than the company was [[Offering|offering]].

To take advantage of the [[Oversubscribed|oversubscribed]] IPO and fulfill that surge in investor demand, Facebook provided not only more [[Shares|shares]] (421 million versus 337 million, or 25% more shares) to investors, but also raised the IPO price range to $34 to $38 per share, around a 15% increase in price. In effect, Facebook and its underwriters raised both the [[Supply|supply]] and price of shares to meet demand and diminish the securities oversubscription for a net increase in value of around 40% from the initial IPO terms. As a result, Facebook raised more capital and carried a higher valuation, but investors got the shares that they wanted.

However, it quickly became clear that Facebook was not at first worth the new IPO price, as the [[Stock|stock]] fell precipitously in its first four months of trading. The stock failed to trade above its IPO price until July 31, 2013. Of course, in the years since, the stock has performed quite well.
