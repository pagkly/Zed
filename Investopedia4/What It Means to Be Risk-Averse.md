[[What It Means to Be Risk-Averse]]
## What Is [[Risk]] Averse?

The term [[Risk|risk]]-averse describes the investor who chooses the preservation of capital over the potential for a higher-than-average [[Return|return]].

In investing, [[Risk|risk]] equals price [[Volatility|volatility]]. A volatile investment can make you rich or devour your savings. A conservative investment [[Will|will]] grow slowly and steadily over time.

Low-[[Risk|risk]] means stability. A low-risk investment guarantees a reasonable if unspectacular [[Return|return]], with a near-zero chance that any of the original investment [[Will|will]] be lost.

Generally, the [[Return|return]] on a low-[[Risk|risk]] investment [[Will|will]] match, or slightly exceed, the level of inflation over time. A high-risk investment may [[Gain|gain]] or lose a bundle of money.

## Understanding the [[Risk]]-Averse Investor

The term [[risk-neutral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskneutral.asp) describes the attitude of an individual who evaluates investment alternatives by focusing solely on potential gains regardless of the [[Risk|risk]]. That may seem counter-intuitive: To evaluate reward without considering risk seems inherently risky.

Nonetheless, offered two investment opportunities, the [[Risk|risk]]-[[Neutral|neutral]] investor looks only at the potential gains of each investment and ignores the potential downside risk.

The [[Risk|risk]]-averse investor [[Will|will]] pass up the opportunity for a large [[Gain|gain]] in favor of safety.

### [[Risk]]-Averse Investment Choices

[[Risk]]-averse investors typically invest their money in savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), municipal and corporate bonds, and dividend growth [[Stocks|stocks]].

All of the above, with the exception of dividend growth [[Stocks|stocks]], virtually guarantee that the amount invested [[Will|will]] still be there whenever the investor chooses to cash it in.

Dividend growth [[Stocks|stocks]], like any [[Stock|stock]] [[Shares|shares]], move up or down in value. However, they are known for two major attributes: They are shares of mature companies with proven track records and a steady flow of income, and they regularly pay their investors a dividend. This dividend can be paid to the investor as an income supplement or reinvested in the company's stock to add to the account's growth over time.

### Attributes of the [[Risk]]-Averse

[[Risk]]-averse investors also are known as conservative investors. They are, by nature or by circumstances, unwilling to accept [[Volatility|volatility]] in their investment portfolios. They want their investments to be highly liquid. That is, that money must be there in full when they're ready to make a withdrawal. No waiting for the markets to swing up again.

The greatest number of [[Risk|risk]]-averse investors can be found among older investors and retirees. They may have spent decades building a nest egg. Now that they are using it, or planning on using it soon, they are unwilling to risk losses.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Risk]]-averse investors prioritize the safety of [[Principal|principal]] over the possibility of a higher [[Return|return]] on their money.
-   They prefer liquid investments. That is, their money can be accessed when needed, regardless of market conditions at the moment.
-   [[Risk]]-averse investors generally favor dividend growth [[Stocks|stocks]], municipal and corporate bonds, CDs, and savings accounts.

## Examples of [[Risk]]-Averse Investments

### Savings Accounts

A high-[[Yield|yield]] savings account from a bank or credit union provides a stable [[Return|return]] with virtually no investment [[Risk|risk]]. The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/fdic-insured-bank-account.asp) (FDIC) and the [[National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)]], insure funds held in these savings accounts up to generous limits.

The term "high-[[Yield|yield]]" is relative, however. The [[Return|return]] on the money should meet or slightly exceed the level of inflation.

### Municipal and Corporate Bonds

State and local governments and corporations routinely raise money by issuing bonds. These [[Debt|debt]] instruments pay a steady dividend to their investors.

Defaults on bonds are so rare that they make the history books. Russia defaulted on some of its debts during a [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] in 1998.1 The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 was partially caused by the collapse of bonds that were backed by mortgages made to subprime borrowers.2

Notably, the agencies tasked with [[Rating|rating]] those bonds should have assigned them ratings that reflected the risks of the investments. They were "junk bonds" marketed as safe bonds.

Defaults on bonds are possible but they are so rare that they make history. Russia defaulted on some of its debts during a [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] in 1998.1

[[Risk]]-averse investors buy bonds issued by stable governments and healthy corporations. Their bonds get the highest AAA [[Rating|rating]].

In the worst-case bankruptcy scenario, bondholders have first dibs on repayment from the proceeds of liquidation.

Municipal bonds have one edge over corporate bonds. They are generally exempt from federal and state taxes, which enhances the investor's total [[Return|return]].

### Dividend Growth [[Stocks]]

Dividend growth [[Stocks|stocks]] appeal to [[Risk|risk]]-averse investors because their predictable dividend payments help offset losses even during a downturn in the [[Stock|stock]]'s price.

In any case, companies that increase their annual dividends each year typically don’t show the same [[Volatility|volatility]] as [[Stocks|stocks]] purchased for capital appreciation.

Many of these are [[Stocks|stocks]] in so-called defensive sectors. That is, the companies are steady earners that aren't as severely affected by an overall downturn in the economy. Examples are companies in the utilities business and companies that sell consumer staples.

Investors generally have the option of reinvesting the dividends to buy more [[Shares|shares]] of the [[Stock|stock]] or taking immediate payment of the dividend.

### Certificates of Deposit

[[Risk]]-averse investors who don’t need to access their money immediately could place it in a certificate of deposit. CDs typically pay slightly more than savings accounts but require the investor to deposit the money for a longer period of time. Early withdrawals are possible but come with penalties that may erase any income from the investment or even bite into the [[Principal|principal]].

The only [[Risk|risk]] in a CD is that interest rates [[Will|will]] rise substantially while the money is deposited. The investor thus will have lost the opportunity for a higher [[Return|return]], and the money invested might not earn enough to offset the impact of inflation that occurred while it was deposited.

CDs are particularly useful for [[Risk|risk]]-averse investors who want to diversify the cash portion of their [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. That is, they might deposit some of their cash in a savings account for immediate access, and the rest in a longer-term account that earns a better [[Return|return]].
