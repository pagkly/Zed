[[Whole-Life Cost]]
## What Is [[Whole-Life Cost]]?

[[Whole-Life Cost|Whole-life cost]] is the total expense of owning an asset over its entire life, from purchase to disposal, as determined by [[financial analysis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-analysis.asp). It is also known as the life-cycle cost, the lifetime cost, "cradle to grave," or "womb to tomb." Whole-life cost includes purchase and installation, design and building costs, operating costs, maintenance, associated financing costs, depreciation, and disposal costs.

[[Whole-Life Cost|Whole-life cost]] also takes into account certain costs that are usually overlooked, such as those related to environmental and [[social impact]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-impact-statement.asp) factors. In the example of constructing a nuclear power station, it is possible to calculate the environmental impact of making the concrete containment and the water required for copper refinement, in addition to other components.

Whereas a number of options may be portrayed as "good" for the environment, a [[Whole-Life Cost|whole-life cost]] analysis allows a determination of whether or not one solution carries a lower or higher environmental cost than another.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Whole-Life Cost|Whole-life cost]] is the total expense of owning an asset over its entire life, from purchase to disposal.
-   [[Whole-Life Cost|Whole-life cost]] includes purchase and installation, design and building costs, operating costs, maintenance, associated financing costs, depreciation, and disposal costs.
-   [[Whole-Life Cost|Whole-life cost]] also takes into account certain costs that are usually overlooked, such as those related to environmental and social impact factors.
-   Typically, the focus is on the up-front capital costs of creation or acquisition, and many organizations fail to take into account the longer-term costs of an asset.

## Understanding [[Whole-Life Cost]] Analysis

[[Whole-Life Cost|Whole-life cost]] analysis is often applied when evaluating different options when investing in new assets and for analyses that attempt to minimize whole-life cost over the lifetime of an asset. It may also be used to decide between two different projects or to make [[acquisition]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp) decisions.

When comparing investment decisions, a [[financial analyst]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/121815/financial-analyst-career-path-qualifications.asp) must look at all potential future costs, not just acquisition expenses. Typically, the focus is on the up-front capital costs of creation or acquisition, and many organizations fail to take into account the longer-term costs of an asset. Without considering whole-life costs, it's possible that an asset’s [[Return|return]] [[Will|will]] likely be overestimated. While an asset may have low development costs, its purchase may lead to high maintenance or customer service costs in the future.

While most short-term costs—and even [[depreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp)—can be readily measured or estimated, long-term costs are more difficult to estimate. In addition, factors such as environmental or social impact cannot be easily quantified. Nevertheless, whole-life costing may provide a more accurate picture of the true cost of an asset than most other methods.

The value of determining [[Whole-Life Cost|whole-life cost]] can be demonstrated when considering the purchase of a large piece of equipment for a factory. Consider for example a machine that attaches nylon flock to foam rubber pads used in the construction of painting tools. Beyond the initial cost of purchasing and installing the flocking machine, it [[Will|will]] have any number of components requiring periodic maintenance and replacement. Such a machine may also present environmental hazards when cleaned or require complex disassembly in order to be disposed of. The whole-life cost analysis of this equipment purchase will be critical in estimating the long-term financial benefit of its purchase and use.
