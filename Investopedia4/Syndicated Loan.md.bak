[[Syndicated Loan]]
## What Is a [[Syndicated Loan]]?

A [[Syndicated Loan|syndicated loan]], also known as a syndicated bank [[facility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facility.asp), is financing offered by a group of lenders—referred to as a [[syndicate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/syndicate.asp)—who work together to provide funds for a single borrower. The borrower can be a corporation, a large project, or a sovereign government. The [[Loan|loan]] can involve a fixed amount of funds, a credit line, or a combination of the two.

Syndicated loans arise when a project requires too large a [[Loan|loan]] for a single [[Lender|lender]] or when a project needs a specialized lender with expertise in a specific asset class. Syndicating the loan allows lenders to spread [[Risk|risk]] and take part in financial opportunities that may be too large for their individual capital base. Interest rates on this type of loan can be fixed or floating, based on a [[benchmark]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) rate such as the [[London Interbank Offered Rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) (LIBOR). LIBOR is an average of the interest rates that major global banks borrow from each other.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Syndicated Loan|syndicated loan]], or a syndicated bank facility, is financing offered by a group of lenders—called a syndicate—who work together to provide funds for a borrower.
-   The borrower can be a corporation, a large project, or a sovereign government.
-   Because they involve such large sums, syndicated loans are spread out among several financial institutions to mitigate the [[Risk|risk]] in case the borrower defaults.

## Understanding a [[Syndicated Loan]]

In cases of syndicated loans, there is typically a [[lead bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lead-bank.asp) or [[underwriter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp), known as the arranger, the agent, or the lead [[Lender|lender]]. The lead bank may put up a proportionally bigger share of the [[Loan|loan]], or it may perform duties such as dispersing cash flows among the other syndicate members and administrative tasks.

The main goal of syndicated lending is to spread the [[Risk|risk]] of a borrower [[Default|default]] across multiple lenders or banks, or [[institutional investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp), such as pension funds and [[hedge funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp). Because syndicated loans tend to be much larger than standard bank loans, the risk of even one borrower defaulting could cripple a single [[Lender|lender]]. Syndicated loans are also used in the leveraged buyout community to fund large corporate takeovers with primarily [[Debt|debt]] funding.

Syndicated loans can be made on a best-efforts basis, which means that if enough investors can't be found, the amount the borrower receives is lower than originally anticipated. These loans can also be split into dual [[tranches]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/[[Tranches|tranches]].asp) for banks that fund standard [[Revolving Credit|revolving credit]] lines and institutional investors that fund fixed-rate term loans.

Because they involve such large sums, syndicated loans are spread out among several financial institutions, which mitigates the [[Risk|risk]] in case the borrower defaults.

## Example of a [[Syndicated Loan]]

Syndicated loans are usually too large for a single [[Lender|lender]] to handle. For example, the Chinese corporation Tencent [[Holdings]] Ltd., the biggest internet company in Asia and owner of popular messaging services WeChat and QQ, signed a [[Syndicated Loan|syndicated loan]] deal on March 24, 2017, to raise $4.65 billion. The [[Loan|loan]] deal included commitments from a dozen banks with Citigroup Inc. acting as the coordinator, mandated lead arranger, and [[book runner]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookrunner.asp), which is the lead underwriter in a new [[Debt|debt]] [[Offering|offering]] that handles the "books."

Previously, Tencent had increased the size of another [[Syndicated Loan|syndicated loan]] to $4.4 billion on June 6, 2016. That [[Loan|loan]], used to fund company acquisitions, was underwritten by five large institutions: Citigroup Inc., Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Bank of China, HSBC [[Holdings]] PLC, and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. The five organizations together created a syndicated loan that encompassed a five-year facility split between a [[term loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termloan.asp) and a [[revolver]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revolver.asp). A revolver is a [[Revolving Credit|revolving credit]] line, meaning the borrower can pay down the balance and borrow again.
