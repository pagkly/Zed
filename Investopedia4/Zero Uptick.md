[[Zero Uptick]]
## DEFINITION of [[Zero Uptick]]

[[Zero Uptick|Zero uptick]] is a transaction executed at the same price as the trade immediately preceding it, but at a price higher than the transaction before that. For example, if [[Shares|shares]] are bought and sold at $47, followed by $48 and $48, the last trade at $48 is considered to be a zero uptick. This distinction can be important for [[short sellers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) trying to avoid shorting an ascending [[Stock|stock]]. Also known as a zero-plus tick.

## BREAKING DOWN [[Zero Uptick]]

The technique of shorting on a [[Zero Uptick|zero uptick]] is not applicable to all investment markets, due to various rules and regulations prohibiting or restricting such transactions. The [[Forex]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp) of foreign exchange market, which has limited restrictions on shorting, is among the markets in which the technique is more popular.

## Uptick Rules

The [[Uptick Rule]] (also known as the "plus tick rule") is a former law established by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) that requires every short sale transaction to be entered at a higher price than the previous trade. This rule was introduced in the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] as Rule 10a-1 and implemented in 1938. It prevents short sellers from adding to the downward [[Momentum|momentum]] of an asset already experiencing sharp declines.

By entering a short sale order with a price above the current bid, a short seller ensures their order is filled on an uptick. The [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] is disregarded when trading some types of financial instruments such as [[Futures|futures]], single [[Stock|stock]] futures, currencies or market ETFs such as the [[QQQQ]] or SPDRs. These instruments can be shorted on a [downtick](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtick.asp) because they are highly liquid and have enough buyers willing to enter into a [long position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp), ensuring that the price [[Will|will]] rarely be driven to unjustifiably low levels.

The [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] was eliminated in 2008 and later reinstated, but only activated when any individual company's [[Shares|shares]] have fallen at least 10% in a trading day.

The [[Uptick Rule|uptick rule]] can be frustrating to short sellers (people who are betting that a [[Stock|stock]] [[Will|will]] fall) because they must wait for the stock to stabilize before their order can be filled. 

Some investors argue that uptick rules inhibit trading and shrink [[Liquidity|liquidity]]. In order to short a [[Stock|stock]], an investor must first borrow the [[Shares|shares]] from someone who owns them. This creates demand for the shares. The reality is that [[Short Selling|short selling]] provides [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) to markets and also prevents [[Stocks|stocks]] from being bid up to ridiculously high levels on hype and over-optimism.
