[[Option Premium Definition]]
## What Is an Option [[Premium]]?

An option [[Premium|premium]] is the current market price of an option contract. It is thus the income received by the seller (writer) of an [[option contract]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052214/trading-options-[[Futures|futures]]-contracts.asp) to another party. In-the-money option premiums are composed of two factors: intrinsic and extrinsic value. Out-of-the-money options' premiums consist solely of extrinsic value.

For [[Stock|stock]] options, the [[Premium|premium]] is quoted as a dollar amount per share, and most contracts represent the commitment of 100 [[Shares|shares]].

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Premium|premium]] on an option is its price in the market.
-   Option [[Premium|premium]] [[Will|will]] consist of extrinsic, or time value for out-of-the-money contracts and both intrinsic and extrinsic value for in-the-money options.
-   An option's [[Premium|premium]] [[Will|will]] generally be greater given more time to expiration and/or greater implied [[Volatility|volatility]].

## Understanding Option [[Premium]]

Investors who write, which means to sell in this case, calls or [[puts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp) use option premiums as a source of current income in line with a broader investment strategy to [[Hedge|hedge]] all or a portion of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. Option prices quoted on an exchange, such as the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cboe.asp) (CBOE), are considered premiums as a rule, because the options themselves have no [[Underlying|underlying]] value.

The components of an option [[Premium|premium]] include its [[intrinsic value]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/12/intrinsic-value.asp), its [[time value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalue.asp) and the [[implied volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp) of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset. As the option nears its expiration date, the time value [[Will|will]] edge closer and closer to $0, while the intrinsic value will closely represent the difference between the underlying [[Security|security]]'s price and the strike price of the contract.

## Factors of Option [[Premium]]

The main factors affecting an option's price are the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]]'s price, [[moneyness]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneyness.asp), [[Useful Life|useful life]] of the option and implied [[Volatility|volatility]]. As the price of the underlying security changes, the option [[Premium|premium]] changes. As the underlying security's price increases, the premium of a call option increases, but the premium of a put option decreases. As the underlying security's price decreases, the premium of a put option increases, and the opposite is true for call options.

The moneyness affects the option's [[Premium|premium]] because it indicates how far away the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] price is from the specified strike price. As an option becomes further [[in-the-money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp), the option's premium normally increases. Conversely, the option premium decreases as the option becomes further [[out-of-the-money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp). For example, as an option becomes further out-of-the-money, the option premium loses intrinsic value, and the value stems primarily from the time value.

The time until expiration, or the [[Useful Life|useful life]], affects the time value portion of the option's [[Premium|premium]]. As the option approaches its [[expiration date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp), the option's premium stems mainly from the intrinsic value. For example, deep out-of-the-money options that are expiring in one trading day would normally be worth $0, or very close to $0.

## Implied [[Volatility]] and Option Price

Implied [[Volatility|volatility]] is derived from the option's price, which is plugged into an option's pricing model to indicate how volatile a [[Stock|stock]]'s price may be in the future. Moreover, it affects the extrinsic value portion of option premiums. If investors are [[long options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp), an increase in implied volatility would add to the value. This is because the greater the volatility of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset, the more chances the option has of finishing in-the-money. The opposite is true if implied volatility decreases.

For example, assume an investor is long one call option with an annualized implied [[Volatility|volatility]] of 20%. Therefore, if the implied volatility increases to 50% during the option's life, the call option [[Premium|premium]] would appreciate in value. An option's [[vega]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vega.asp) is its change in premium given a 1% change in implied volatility.
