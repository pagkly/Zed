[[Tender Offer Definition]]
## What Is a Tender [[Offer]]?

A tender [[Offer|offer]] is a bid to purchase some or all of the shareholders' [[Stock|stock]] in a corporation. Tender offers are typically made publicly and invite shareholders to sell their [[Shares|shares]] for a specified price and within a particular window of time. The price offered is usually at a [[Premium|premium]] to the market price and is often contingent upon a minimum or a maximum number of shares sold.

To [[tender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tender.asp) is to invite bids for a project or accept a formal [[Offer|offer]] such as a [takeover bid](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Stocks|stocks]]/08/corporate-takeover-defense.asp). An exchange offer is a specialized type of tender offer in which securities or other non-cash alternatives are offered in exchange for [[Shares|shares]].

### Key Takeaways

-   A tender [[Offer|offer]] is a public solicitation to all shareholders requesting that they tender their [[Stock|stock]] for sale at a specific price during a certain time.
-   The tender [[Offer|offer]] typically is set at a higher price per share than the company’s current [[Stock|stock]] price, providing shareholders a greater incentive to sell their [[Shares|shares]].
-   In the case of a takeover attempt, the tender may be conditional on the prospective buyer being able to obtain a certain amount of [[Shares|shares]], such as a sufficient number of shares to constitute a controlling interest in the company.

## How a Tender [[Offer]] Works

A tender [[Offer|offer]] often occurs when an investor proposes buying [[Shares|shares]] from every [[shareholder]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) of a publicly traded company for a certain price at a certain time. The investor normally offers a higher price per share than the company’s [[Stock|stock]] price, providing shareholders a greater incentive to sell their shares.

Most tender offers are made at a specified price that represents a significant [[Premium|premium]] over the current [[Stock|stock]] share price. A tender [[Offer|offer]] might, for instance, be made to purchase outstanding stock [[Shares|shares]] for $18 a share when the current market price is only $15 a share. The reason for [[Offering|offering]] the premium is to induce a large number of shareholders to sell their shares. In the case of a takeover attempt, the tender may be conditional on the prospective buyer being able to obtain a certain amount of shares, such as a sufficient number of shares to constitute a controlling interest in the company.

A publicly traded company issues a tender [[Offer|offer]] with the intent to buy back its own outstanding securities. Sometimes, a privately or publicly traded company executes a tender offer directly to shareholders without the board of directors’ (BOD) consent, resulting in a [[hostile takeover]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hostiletakeover.asp). Acquirers include [[hedge funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp), [[private equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp) firms, management-led investor groups, and other companies.

The day after the announcement, a target company’s [[Shares|shares]] trade below or at a discount to the [[Offer|offer]] price, which is attributed to the uncertainty of and time needed for the offer. As the closing date nears and issues are resolved, the spread typically narrows.

[[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]] laws require any corporation or individual acquiring 5% of a company to disclose information to the SEC, the target company, and the exchange.1

### Important

The [[Shares|shares]] of [[Stock|stock]] purchased in a tender [[Offer|offer]] become the property of the purchaser. From that point forward, the purchaser, like any other shareholder, has the right to [[Hold|hold]] or sell the shares at his discretion.

## Example of a Tender [[Offer]]

For example, Company A has a current [[Stock|stock]] price of $10 per share. An investor, seeking to [[Gain|gain]] control of the corporation, submits a tender [[Offer|offer]] of $12 per share with the condition that he acquires at least 51% of the [[Shares|shares]]. In corporate [[Finance|finance]], a tender offer is often called a takeover bid as the investor seeks to take over control of the corporation.

## Advantages of a Tender [[Offer]]

Tender offers provide several advantages to investors. For example, investors are not obligated to buy [[Shares|shares]] until a set number is tendered, which eliminates large upfront cash outlays and prevents investors from liquidating [[Stock|stock]] positions if offers fail. Acquirers can also include escape clauses, releasing [[Liability|liability]] for buying shares. For example, if the government rejects a proposed acquisition citing antitrust violations, the acquirer can refuse to buy tendered shares.

In many instances, investors [[Gain|gain]] control of target companies in less than one month if shareholders accept their offers; they also generally earn more than normal investments in the [[Stock|stock]] market.

## Disadvantages of a Tender [[Offer]]

Although tender offers provide many benefits, there are some noted disadvantages. A tender [[Offer|offer]] is an expensive way to complete a [[Hostile Takeover|hostile takeover]] as investors pay SEC filing fees, attorney costs, and other fees for specialized services. It can be a time-consuming process as [[depository]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depository.asp) banks verify tendered [[Shares|shares]] and issue payments on behalf of the investor. Also, if other investors become involved in a hostile takeover, the offer price increases, and because there are no guarantees, the investor may lose money on the deal.
