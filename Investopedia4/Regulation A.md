[[Regulation A]]
## What Is [[Regulation A]]?

[[Regulation A]] is an exemption from registration requirements—instituted by the Securities Act—that applies to public offerings of securities that do not exceed $50 million in any one-year period. Companies utilizing the Regulation A exemption must still [[file offering statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/secbeginning.asp). However, the companies utilizing the exemption are given distinct advantages over companies that must fully register. The issuer of a Regulation A [[Offering|offering]] must give buyers documentation with the issue, similar to the [[prospectus]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp) of a registered offering.

## Understanding [[Regulation A]]

Typically, the advantages offered by [[Regulation A]] offerings make up for the stringent documentation requirement. Among the advantages provided by the exemption are more-streamlined financial statements without audit obligations, three possible format choices to use to arrange the [[Offering|offering]] circular, and no requirement to provide Exchange Act reports until the company has more than 500 shareholders and $10 million in assets.

[[Regulation A]] is an exemption from registration requirements—instituted by the Securities Act—that apply to public offerings of securities that do not exceed $50 million in any one-year period.

Updates to [[Regulation A]] in 2015 allow companies to generate income under two different tiers. It is essential for investors interested in purchasing securities being sold by companies utilizing Regulation A to understand what tier the [[Offering|offering]] is being provided under.

Every company is now required to indicate the tier its [[Offering|offering]] is conducted under on the front of its disclosure document or offering circular. This is important because the two tiers represent two different types of investments. All offerings under [[Regulation A]] are subject to state and federal jurisdiction.

## [[Regulation A]] Tier 1 vs. Regulation A Tier 2

Under tier 1, a company is permitted to [[Offer|offer]] a maximum of $20 million in any one-year period. The issuing company must also provide an [[Offering|offering]] circular, which must be filed with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]] and is subject to a [[vetting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vetting.asp) process by the [[Commission|commission]] and securities regulators in the individual states relevant to the offering.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Regulation A]] was instituted by the Securities Act.
-   It applies to public offerings of securities (not to exceed $50 million) within a year.
-   [[Regulation A]] was updated in 2015 to allow companies to generate income under two separate tiers representing two different types of investments.
-   All offerings under [[Regulation A]] are subject to state and federal jurisdiction, according to the Securities Act.

Companies issuing offerings under tier 1 are not required to produce reports continually. They are only required to issue a report on the final status of the [[Offering|offering]].

There are some significant differences for securities offered under tier 2. Companies can [[Offer|offer]] up to $50 million in any one-year period under tier 2 but not tier 1.

While an [[Offering|offering]] circular is required and is subject to review and vetting by the SEC, it does not have to be qualified by any state securities regulators. Also, companies offering securities under tier 2 must produce continual reports on the offering, including its final status.
