## What Is a Weather [[Derivative]]?

A weather [[Derivative|derivative]] is a financial instrument used by companies or individuals to [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) against the [[Risk|risk]] of weather-related losses. The seller of a weather derivative agrees to bear the risk of disasters in [[Return|return]] for a [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp). If no damages occur before the expiration of the contract, the seller [[Will|will]] make a profit—and in the event of unexpected or adverse weather, the buyer of the derivative claims the agreed amount.

### Key Takeaways

-   A weather [[Derivative|derivative]] is a financial instrument used by companies or individuals to [[Hedge|hedge]] against the [[Risk|risk]] of weather-related losses.
-   They trade [[Over-The-Counter (OTC)|over-the-counter (OTC)]], through brokers, and via an exchange.
-   Weather derivatives work like insurance, paying out contract holders if weather events occur or if losses are incurred due to certain weather-related events.
-   Agriculture, tourism and travel, and energy are just a few of the sectors that utilize weather derivatives to mitigate the risks of weather.

## Understanding Weather Derivatives

The [[profitability]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp) and revenues of virtually every industry—agriculture, energy, entertainment, construction, travel, and others—depend to a great extent on the vagaries of temperature, rainfall, and storms. Unexpected weather rarely results in price adjustments that entirely make up for lost [[revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp), making weather derivatives, securities that allow companies to [[Hedge|hedge]] against the possibility of weather that might adversely affect their business, a pivotal investment for many.

Companies whose business depends on the weather, such as hydro-electric businesses or those who manage sporting events, might use weather derivatives as part of a [[risk-management]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-[[Risk|risk]]-management/) strategy. Farmers, meanwhile, may use weather derivatives to [[Hedge|hedge]] against a poor harvest caused by too much or too little rain, sudden temperature swings, or destructive winds.

It is estimated that nearly 20% of the U.S. economy is directly affected by the weather.

In 1997, weather derivatives began trading [[over-the-counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) and, within a few years, they had become an $8 billion industry tradeable on an exchange and treated by some [[Hedge|hedge]] funds as an investment class. The [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp) (CME) lists weather [[Futures|futures]] contracts for a few dozen cities, the majority of them in the U.S.

CME weather [[Futures|futures]], unlike OTC contracts, are standardized contracts traded publicly on the open market in an electronic auction type of environment, with continuous negotiation of prices and complete [price transparency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetransparency.asp). Investors who like weather derivatives appreciate their low [[correlation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Correlation|correlation]].asp) with traditional markets.

## Types of Weather Derivatives

Weather derivatives typically have a basis to an [[index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) that measures a particular aspect of weather. For example, an index might be the total rainfall over a specified period in a specific place. Another can be for the number of times the temperature falls below freezing. 

One climate index for weather derivatives is known as [[heating degree days]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/heatingdegreeday.asp) or HDD. Under HDD contracts, each day the daily mean temperature falls below a predetermined reference point over a specified period, the amount of the departure is recorded and added to a cumulative count. The final figure determines whether the seller pays out or receives payment.

## Weather Derivatives vs. Insurance

Weather derivatives are similar to but different from [[insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp). Insurance covers low-probability, catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes. In contrast, [[derivatives]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) cover higher-probability events such as a dryer-than-expected summer.

Insurance does not protect against the reduction of demand resulting from a slightly wetter summer than average, for example, whereas weather derivatives can do just that. Since weather derivatives and insurance cover two different possibilities, a company might have an interest in purchasing both.

Also, since the contract is index-based, buyers of weather derivatives do not need to demonstrate a loss. In order to collect insurance, on the other hand, damage must be shown.

## Weather Derivatives vs. Commodity Derivatives

One important point that differentiates utilities/[commodity](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/commodities-trading-overview/) derivatives (power, electricity, agricultural) and weather derivatives is that the former set allows hedging on price based on a specific volume, while the latter offers to [[Hedge|hedge]] the actual utilization or the [[Yield|yield]], independent of the volume.

For instance, one can lock the price of X barrels of [[crude oil]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crude-oil.asp) or X bushels of corn by buying oil [[futures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Futures|futures]].asp) or corn futures, respectively. But getting into weather derivatives allows hedging the overall [[Risk|risk]] for [[Yield|yield]] and utilization.

A temperature dipping below 10 degrees [[Will|will]] result in complete damage to wheat crop, whereas rain on weekends in Las Vegas will impact city tours. Hence, a combination of weather and commodity derivatives is best for overall [[Risk|risk]] mitigation.
