[[Underperform]]
## What Is [[Underperform]]?

If an investment is underperforming, it is not keeping pace with other securities. In a rising market, for example, a [[Stock|stock]] is underperforming if it is not experiencing gains equal to or greater to the advance in the S&P [500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp). In a down market, a stock that is a falling faster than the [[broader market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broad-basedindex.asp) is an underpeformer. "[[Underperform]]" is also an analyst recommendation assigned to a stock when [[Shares|shares]] are expected to do slightly worse than the market [[Return|return]]. The designation is also known as market "moderate sell" or "weak [[Hold|hold]]."

### Key Takeaways

-   An underpeforming [[Stock|stock]] is not keeping pace with the broader market.
-   The underpeform [[Rating|rating]] can have varying meanings depending the brokerage firms issuing the rating; it is sometimes called a weak [[Hold|hold]] or moderate sell.
-   An analyst [[Will|will]] assign an [[Underperform|underperform]] [[Rating|rating]] when a [[Stock|stock]] is not expected to keep pace with the market, but the worries do not justify a sell rating.
-   There are a number of reasons why a [[Stock|stock]] might receive an [[Underperform|underperform]] [[Rating|rating]], but most of the time, it comes as the result of comparing company metrics to those of peers or the overall market.

## Understanding the [[Underperform]] Designation

Exact definitions vary between brokerages, but an "[[Underperform|underperform]]" [rating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Rating|rating]].asp) is worse, in general, than "[[Neutral|neutral]]" but better than "sell" or "[strong sell](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strongsell.asp)."

-   [[Neutral]] is assigned to a [[Stock|stock]] that is expected to deliver results that match the broader market.
-   [[Underperform]] is a [[Stock|stock]] that [[Will|will]] likely perform slightly below par: seeing greater losses in a down market and below-average gains in an up market.
-   A sell [[Rating|rating]] is given to a [[Stock|stock]] that is expected to lose value.
-   Strong sell reflects concerns that the company is in deep trouble and the [[Stock|stock]] could suffer substantial losses.

A [[Security|security]] might receive the [[Underperform|underperform]] designation if it does not meet or exceed a metric it is being compared against. The comparison might be against the overall market, a competing company, or an [[index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp). A variety of other issues could bring the underpeform [[Rating|rating]], such as concerns about the company's [[Debt|debt]] levels, [[price-to-earnings ratios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp), or loss of market share.

## Examples of [[Underperform]] [[Rating]]

An industry might be described as underperforming. For example, the [[utilities industry]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utilities_sector.asp) might receive this designation because the growth of economy may boost the industry yet inflation could result in higher interest rates, which would be a negative for the utility sector. Similarly, the real [[Estate|estate]] market might have seen low interest rates drive investment in [[Real Estate Investment Trusts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp), but rising rates can change that dynamic. Those factors could create a circumstance where an industry is not generating returns to the full potential and an undeperform [[Rating|rating]] is warranted.

A specific [[Stock|stock]] is assigned an underpeform [[Rating|rating]] by an analyst if there are concerns that [[Shares|shares]] [[Will|will]] not keep pace with others for various reasons, but those worries do not [[Warrant|warrant]] an outright sell rating. For example, though a company sees growth or positive earnings for a quarter or for the year, those returns might not be on a par with the market. So if an automobile manufacturer reports a total [[Return|return]] of 12% for its fiscal year, while the S&P 500 sees a 23% total return for that year, the auto manufacturer could be classified as [[Underperform|underperform]].

Depending on the brokerage house, an outlook [[Rating|rating]] of [[Underperform|underperform]] can have different degrees of meaning. At [[Charles Schwab]](https://www.investopedia.com/charles-schwab-review-4587888), for instance, an outlook of underperform also carries a sell [guidance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guidance.asp). If a company receives a "strongly underperform" outlook from the firm, it [[Will|will]] also receive the sell guidance. These ratings can mean there is an expectation that the [[Stocks|stocks]] will not meet benchmarks.
