[[What Is an Unsecured Note]]?
## [[What Is an Unsecured Note]]?

An [[Unsecured|unsecured]] note is a [[Loan|loan]] that is not secured by the issuer's assets. [[Unsecured]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecured.asp) notes are similar to [[debentures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debenture.asp) but [[Offer|offer]] a higher [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp). Unsecured notes offer less [[Security|security]] than a debenture. Such notes are also often uninsured and subordinated. The note is structured for a fixed period of time.

### Key Takeaways

-   An [[Unsecured|unsecured]] note is corporate [[Debt|debt]] that does not have [[Collateral|collateral]] attached and is therefore a riskier prospect for an investor.
-   It's different from debentures, [[Unsecured|unsecured]] corporate [[Debt|debt]] that often have insurance policies to pay out in case of a [[Default|default]].
-   Companies sell the [[Unsecured|unsecured]] notes through private placements so as to raise money for purchases, share buyback and other corporate purposes.
-   Because [[Unsecured|unsecured]] [[Debt|debt]] isn't backed by [[Collateral|collateral]] and is higher [[Risk|risk]] the interest rates offered are higher than secured debt, which is backed by collateral.

## Understanding [[Unsecured]] Note

Companies sell [[Unsecured|unsecured]] notes through private offerings to generate money for corporate initiatives such as [[share repurchases]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharerepurchase.asp) and [[acquisitions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp). An unsecured note is not backed by any [[Collateral|collateral]] and thus presents more [[Risk|risk]] to lenders. Due to the higher risk involved, the interest rates on these notes are higher than with secured notes.

In contrast, a [[secured note]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securednote.asp) is a [[Loan|loan]], backed by the borrower's assets, such as a mortgage or auto loan. If the borrower defaults, these assets [[Will|will]] go towards the repayment of the note. For this reason, [[Collateral|collateral]] assets must be worth at least as much as the note. Additional examples of collateral that can be pledged include [[Stocks|stocks]], bonds, jewelry, and artwork.

## [[Unsecured]] Note and Credit [[Rating]]

Credit [[Rating|rating]] agencies [[Will|will]] often rate [[Debt|debt]] issuers. For example, in the case of [[Fitch]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fitch-ratings.asp), this agency will [[Offer|offer]] a letter-based [[credit rating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp) that reflects the chances that the issuer will [[Default|default]], based on internal (i.e. stability of cash flows) and external (market-based) factors.

**Investment-Grade**

-   **AAA:** companies of exceptionally high quality (reliable, with consistent cash flows)
-   **AA:** still high quality; slightly more [[Risk|risk]] than AAA
-   **A:** low [[Default Risk|default risk]]; slightly more vulnerable to business or economic factors
-   **BBB:** low expectation of [[Default|default]]; business or economic factors could adversely affect the company

**Non-Investment Grade**

-   **BB:** elevated vulnerability to [[Default Risk|default risk]], more susceptible to adverse shifts in business or [[Economic Conditions|economic conditions]]; still financially flexibility
-   **B:** degrading financial situation; highly speculative
-   **CCC:** real possibility of [[Default|default]]
-   **CC:** [[Default|default]] is probably
-   **C:** [[Default|default]] or default-like process has begun
-   **RD:** issuer has defaulted on a payment
-   **D:** defaulted

[[Unsecured]] [[Debt|debt]] holders are second to secured debt holders in the event of needing to claim assets in the wake of a company's liquidation.

## [[Unsecured]] Note and Liquidation Preference

[Liquidation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp) occurs when a company is insolvent and cannot pay its obligations when they come due. As company operations come to an end, its remaining assets go towards paying creditors and shareholders who purchased stakes and/or made loans as the company expanded. Each of these parties has a priority in the order of claims to company assets. The most senior claims belong to secured creditors, followed by [[Unsecured|unsecured]] creditors, including bondholders, the government (if the company owes taxes) and employees (if the company owes them unpaid wages or other obligations). Finally, shareholders receive any remaining assets, beginning with those holding [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] followed by holders of [[Common Stock|common stock]].
