[[Upstairs Market Definition]]
## What Is an Upstairs Market?

In [[Finance|finance]] the term “upstairs market” refers to [[trades]](https://www.investopedia.com/trading-4427765) that are carried out directly between the buyer and the seller, with professional [[brokers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) acting as intermediaries. In these transactions, the trades in question are not submitted through a [[stock exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp), and are therefore not visible to other market participants. 

Typically, these types of trades are only conducted by large [[institutional investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp). These markets are sometimes described as [[dark pools]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp), as in the phrase “dark pools of [[Liquidity|liquidity]]”.

### Key Takeaways

-   The upstairs market is a method of trading in which transactions are carried out directly between large institutional investors.1
-   This can be beneficial for reducing [[Transaction Costs|transaction costs]] and maintaining relatively anonymous transactions.
-   Regulators have expressed concern about the potential negative effects of upstairs-market trading on retail investors, leading to new restrictions in some countries.

## How Upstairs Markets Work

From the perspective of institutional investors, upstairs markets can be advantageous for several reasons. To begin with, routing trades through professional intermediaries—away from the eyes of [[retail investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/institutionalinvestor.asp)—can help prevent activities, such as “[front running](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp)”, which might negatively impact the price or execution of the trade. 

In recent years, the upstairs market has grown to encompass over 15% of all trading in the United States, leading some to question whether the practice has undermined the transparency and accessibility of financial markets for retail investors.

In Canada, for example, new regulations were imposed in October 2012 that placed stricter limits on the conditions under which upstairs market transactions can take place. Similar restrictions were introduced in Australia in May 2013, causing the [[volume]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) of upstairs-market transactions to decline significantly in both countries.

In the United States, regulators have questioned whether upstairs market activity could be undermining the quality of trading available to retail investors. However, it remains to be seen whether the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) [[Will|will]] move to constrain the practice.

## Real World Example of an Upstairs Market

There are many reasons why the use of the upstairs market can be attractive to institutional investors. For example, if a [[Hedge Fund|hedge fund]] wishes to unload its position in a [[Security|security]] and accordingly submits a large sell order to the [[Stock|stock]] exchange, that sell order could be interpreted by other market participants as a [[bearish]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear.asp) signal on the security in question. This in turn could cause other investors to bid down the price of that security, causing the [[Hedge|hedge]] fund to obtain a less favorable sale price.

The upstairs market can also be beneficial for institutional investors because of reduced transaction fees. By carrying out a large block order with just one or a small number of institutional [[counterparties]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Counterparty|counterparty]].asp), the firms involved could pay substantially lower overall [[commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Commission|commission]].asp) or other fees as compared to trading with a much larger number of smaller counterparts. 

Indeed, in some cases—such as when executing [[program trades]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/program_trading.asp) that require several transactions to be executed simultaneously—using professional intermediaries in the upstairs market may in fact be the only way to effectively carry out the strategy.
