[[Listing Requirements Definition]]
## What Are Listing Requirements?

Listing requirements comprise the various criteria and minimum standards established by [[Stock|stock]] exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, to allow membership in the exchange. Only if an exchange's listing requirements are met can a company [[list]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listedsecurity.asp) [[Shares|shares]] for trading.

Companies that do not meet listing requirement may still sometimes be able to [[Offer|offer]] their [[Shares|shares]] for trading [[over-the-counter]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC).

### Key Takeaways

-   For a company to trade its [[Shares|shares]] on a [[Stock|stock]] exchange, it must be able to meet that exchange's listing requirements and pay both the exchange's entry and yearly listing fees.
-   Listing requirements vary by exchange and include minimum stockholder's [[Equity|equity]], a minimum share price, and a minimum number of shareholders.
-   Exchanges have listing requirements to ensure that only high-quality securities are traded on them and to uphold the exchange's reputation among investors.

## Understanding Listing Requirements

Listing requirements are a set of conditions which a firm must meet before listing a [[security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) on one of the organized [[Stock|stock]] exchanges, such as the [[New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp), the [[Nasdaq]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/[[Nasdaq|nasdaq]].asp), the London Stock Exchange, or the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The requirements typically measure the size and market share of the security to be [[Listed|listed]], and the [[Underlying|underlying]] financial viability of the issuing firm. Exchanges establish these standards as a means of maintaining their own reputation and [[Visibility|visibility]].

When asking to be [[Listed|listed]] a firm [[Will|will]] have to prove to an exchange that they meet the listing requirements. Because major [[Stock|stock]] exchanges provide a high amount of [[Visibility|visibility]] and [[Liquidity|liquidity]] for a [[Security|security]], trading firms have a strong incentive to meet the listing requirements. Once a security is listed, the issuing firm usually must maintain a set of related but less stringent trading requirements – otherwise, the security faces [[delisting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Delisting|delisting]].asp). Being delisted does not carry any legal penalty; it merely results in expulsion from the specific exchange. 

Firms can cross-list a [[Security|security]] on more than one exchange, and often do. Listing requirements are not barriers to trading altogether, as firms are always free to trade securities [[Over-The-Counter (OTC)|over-the-counter (OTC)]]; however, these do not provide nearly the [[Liquidity|liquidity]], regulatory oversight, prestige or [[Visibility|visibility]] as being [[Listed|listed]] on one of the major [[Stock|stock]] exchanges. 

## Listing Requirements in Practice

Listing requirements vary by exchange but there are certain metrics which are almost always included. The two most important categories of requirements deal with the size of the firm (as defined by annual income or [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp)) and the [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) of the [[Shares|shares]] (a certain number of shares must already have been issued).

For example, the NYSE requires firms to already have 1.1 million publicly-traded [[Shares|shares]] outstanding with a collective market value of at least $100 million; the [[Nasdaq]] requires firms to already have 1.25 million publicly-traded shares with a collective market value of $45 million. Both the NYSE and the Nasdaq require a minimum [[Security|security]] listing price of $4 per share. 

There is generally a listing fee involved as well as yearly listing fees, which scale up depending on the number of [[Shares|shares]] being traded and can total hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[Nasdaq]] fees are considerably lower than those of the NYSE, which has historically made the Nasdaq a more popular choice for newer or smaller firms.
