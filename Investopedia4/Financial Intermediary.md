[[Financial Intermediary]]
## What Is a [[Financial Intermediary]]?

A [[Financial Intermediary|financial intermediary]] is an entity that acts as the [[middleman]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/middleman.asp) between two parties in a financial transaction, such as a [[commercial bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialbank.asp), investment bank, mutual fund, or pension fund. Financial intermediaries [[Offer|offer]] a number of benefits to the average consumer, including safety, [[Liquidity|liquidity]], and [[economies of scale]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp) involved in banking and asset management. Although in certain areas, such as investing, advances in technology threaten to eliminate the financial intermediary, [[Disintermediation|disintermediation]] is much less of a threat in other areas of [[Finance|finance]], including banking and insurance.

### Key Takeaways

-   Financial intermediaries serve as middlemen for financial transactions, generally between banks or funds.
-   These intermediaries help create efficient markets and lower the cost of doing business.
-   Intermediaries can provide leasing or factoring services, but do not accept deposits from the public.
-   Financial intermediaries [[Offer|offer]] the benefit of pooling [[Risk|risk]], reducing cost, and providing [[Economies of Scale|economies of scale]], among others.

## How a [[Financial Intermediary]] Works

A non-bank [[Financial Intermediary|financial intermediary]] does not accept deposits from the general public. The intermediary may provide factoring, [[leasing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lease|lease]].asp), insurance plans or other financial services. Many intermediaries take part in securities exchanges and utilize long-term plans for managing and growing their funds. The overall economic stability of a country may be shown through the activities of financial intermediaries and the growth of the financial services industry.

Financial intermediaries move funds from parties with excess capital to parties needing funds. The process creates efficient markets and lowers the cost of conducting business. For example, a financial advisor connects with clients through purchasing insurance, [[Stocks|stocks]], [[bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), real [[Estate|estate]], and other assets. Banks connect borrowers and lenders by providing capital from other [[financial institutions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp) and from the Federal Reserve. Insurance companies collect premiums for policies and provide policy benefits. A pension fund collects funds on behalf of members and distributes payments to pensioners.

## Types of Financial Intermediaries

[Mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) provide active management of capital pooled by shareholders. The fund manager connects with shareholders through purchasing [[Stock|stock]] in companies he anticipates may [[Outperform|outperform]] the market. By doing so, the manager provides shareholders with assets, companies with capital and the market with [[Liquidity|liquidity]].

## Benefits of Financial Intermediaries

Through a [[Financial Intermediary|financial intermediary]], savers can pool their funds, enabling them to make large investments, which in turn benefits the entity in which they are investing. At the same time, financial intermediaries pool [[Risk|risk]] by spreading funds across a diverse range of investments and loans. Loans benefit households and countries by enabling them to spend more money than they have at the current time. 

Financial intermediaries also provide the benefit of reducing costs on several fronts. For instance, they have access to [[Economies of Scale|economies of scale]] to expertly evaluate the credit profile of potential borrowers and keep records and profiles cost-effectively. Last, they reduce the costs of the many financial transactions an individual investor would otherwise have to make if the [[Financial Intermediary|financial intermediary]] did not exist. 

## Example of a [[Financial Intermediary]]

In July 2016, the European [[Commission]] took on two new financial instruments for European Structural and Investment (ESI) fund investments. The goal was creating easier access to funding for startups and urban development project promoters.1 Loans, [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp), guarantees, and other financial instruments attract greater public and private funding sources that may be reinvested over many cycles as compared to receiving [[grants]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/[[Grant|grant]].asp).

One of the instruments, a co-investment facility, was to provide funding for startups to develop their business models and attract additional financial support through a collective investment plan managed by one main [[Financial Intermediary|financial intermediary]]. The European [[Commission]] projected the total public and private resource investment at approximately €15 million (approximately $17.75 million) per small- and medium-sized enterprise.1
