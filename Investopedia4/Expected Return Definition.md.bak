[[Expected Return Definition]]
## What Is Expected [[Return]]?

The expected [[Return|return]] is the profit or loss that an [[investor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) anticipates on an investment that has known historical [[rates of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) (RoR). It is calculated by multiplying potential outcomes by the chances of them occurring and then totaling these results. Expected return calculations are a key piece of both business operations and financial theory, including in the well-known models of modern [[Portfolio|portfolio]] theory ([MPT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp)) or the [[black-scholes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp) options pricing model.

For example, if an investment has a 50% chance of gaining 20% and a 50% chance of losing 10%, the expected [[Return|return]] would be 5% = (50% x 20% + 50% x -10% = 5%).

### Key Takeaways

-   The expected [[Return|return]] is the amount of profit or loss an investor can anticipate receiving on an investment.
-    An expected [[Return|return]] is calculated by multiplying potential outcomes by the odds of them occurring and then totaling these results.
-   Essentially a long-term [[Weighted|weighted]] average of historical results, expected returns are not guaranteed.

## How Expected [[Return]] Works

The expected [[Return|return]] is a tool used to determine whether an investment has a positive or negative average net outcome. The sum is calculated as the [[expected value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expected-value.asp) (EV) of an investment given its potential returns in different scenarios, as illustrated by the following formula:

> Expected [[Return]] = SUM (Return i x Probability i)

where: "i" indicates each known [[Return|return]] and its respective probability in the series

The expected [[Return|return]] is usually based on historical data and is therefore not guaranteed into the future; however, it does often set reasonable expectations. Therefore, the expected return figure can be though of as a long-term [[Weighted|weighted]] average of [[historical returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historical-returns.asp).

In the formulation above, for instance, the 5% expected [[Return|return]] may never be realized in the future, as the investment is inherently subject to [[systematic]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp) and [[unsystematic]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsystematicrisk.asp) risks. Systematic [[Risk|risk]] the danger to a market sector or the entire market whereas [[Unsystematic Risk|unsystematic risk]] applies to a specific company or industry.

When considering individual investments or portfolios, a more formal equation for expected [[Return|return]] of a financial investment is:

Expected [[Return|return]] = [[Risk|risk]] free [[Premium|premium]] + Beta (expected market return - risk free premium).  Investopedia

where:

-   ra = expected [[Return|return]];
-   rf \= the [[risk-free rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]]-freerate.asp);
-   β = the investment's [[beta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp); and
-   rm =the expected market [[Return|return]]

In essence, this formula states that the expected [[Return|return]] in excess of the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of return depends on the investment's beta, or relative [[Volatility|volatility]] compared to the broader market.

Expected [[Return|return]] is not absolute, as it is a projection and not a realized return.

## Limitations of Expected [[Return]]

Note that it can be quite dangerous to make naive investment decisions based entirely on expected [[Return|return]] calculations. Before making any investment decisions, one should always [[review the risk characteristics]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp) of investment opportunities to determine if the investments align with their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] goals.

For example, assume two hypothetical investments exist. Their annual performance results for the last five years are:

-   _Investment A:_ 12%, 2%, 25%, -9%, and 10%
-   _Investment B_: 7%, 6%, 9%, 12%, and 6%

Both of these investments have expected returns of exactly 8%. However, when analyzing the [[Risk|risk]] of each, as defined by the [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp), Analyst use [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] to reveal historical [[Volatility|volatility]] in investments. Investment A is approximately five times riskier than Investment B. That is, Investment A has a standard deviation of 12.6% and Investment B has a standard deviation of 2.6%.

In addition to expected returns, wise investors should also consider the likelihood of a [[Return|return]] to better assess [[Risk|risk]]. After all, one can find instances where certain [[lotteries]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lottery.asp) [[Offer|offer]] a positive expected return, despite the very low chances of realizing that return.

Pros

-   Gages the performance of an asset
    
-   Weighs different scenarios
    

Cons

-   Doesn't take [[Risk|risk]] into account
    
-   Based largely on historic data
    

## Real World Example of Expected [[Return]]

The expected [[Return|return]] does not just apply to a single [[security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) or asset. It can also be expanded to analyze a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] containing many investments. If the expected return for each investment is known, the portfolio's overall [[expected return]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/how-do-i-calculate-expected-return-my-portfolio-excel.asp) is a [[Weighted|weighted]] average of the expected returns of its components.

For example, let's assume we have an investor interested in the tech sector. His [[Portfolio|portfolio]] contains the following [[Stocks|stocks]]:

-   Alphabet Inc., ([GOOG)](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=goog): $500,000 invested and an expected [[Return|return]] of 15%
-   Apple Inc. ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)): $200,000 invested and an expected [[Return|return]] of 6%
-   Amazon.com Inc. ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn)): $300,000 invested and an expected [[Return|return]] of 9%

With a total [[Portfolio|portfolio]] value of $1 million the weights of Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon in the portfolio are 50%, 20%, and 30%, respectively.

Thus, the expected [[Return|return]] of the total [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is 11.4%:

-   (50% x 15% = 7.5%) + (20% x 6% = 1.2%) + (30% x 9% = 2.7%)
-   (7.5% + 1.2% + 2.7% = 11.4%)

## Expected [[Return]] vs. [[Standard Deviation]]

Expected [[Return|return]] and [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) are two statistical measures that can be used to analyze a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. The expected return of a portfolio is the anticipated amount of returns that a portfolio may generate, making it the mean (average) of the portfolio's possible return distribution; whereas the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of a portfolio measures the amount that the returns deviate from its mean, making it a proxy for the portfolio's [[Risk|risk]].
