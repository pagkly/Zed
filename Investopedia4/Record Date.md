[[Record Date]]
## What Is the [[Record Date]]?

The [[Record Date|record date]], or date of record, is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) are eligible to receive a [[dividend]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) or distribution. The determination of a record date is required to ascertain who exactly a company's shareholders are as of that date, since shareholders of an actively traded [[Stock|stock]] are continually changing. The shareholders of record as of the record date [[Will|will]] be entitled to receive the dividend or distribution, declared by the company.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Record Date|record date]] is the cut-off date used to determine which shareholders are entitled to a corporate dividend.
-   The [[Record Date|record date]] [[Will|will]] usually be the day following the ex-dividend date, which is the trading date on (and after) which the dividend is not owed to a new buyer of the [[Stock|stock]].1
-   To be eligible for the dividend, you must buy the [[Stock|stock]] at least two business days before the [[Record Date|record date]].

## Understanding [[Record Date]]

The [[Record Date|record date]] is important because of its relation to another key date, the [[ex-dividend date]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/ex-dividend-date/). On and after the ex-dividend date, a buyer of the [[Stock|stock]] [[Will|will]] not receive the dividend as the seller is entitled to it. A company’s record date is a key concept to understand before buying and selling dividend [[Stocks|stocks]]. The exact definition of a record date may vary slightly between countries, such as between the [[London Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lse.asp) (LSE) and [[the New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE).

The [[ex-dividend date is set exactly one business day before the dividend record date]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042915/what-difference-between-record-date-and-exdividend-date.asp).1 This is because of the T+2 system of settlement presently used in North America, whereby [[stock trades]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082614/how-[[Stock|stock]]-market-works.asp) settle two business days after the transaction is carried out. Thus, if an investor buys a stock one business day before its [[Record Date|record date]], their trade would only settle the day after the record date. They would therefore not be a shareholder of record for receiving the dividend. Note that different rules apply if the dividend is 25% or greater of the value of the [[Security|security]], which is quite rare. In this case, the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]] indicates that the ex-date is the first business day following the payable date.2

To ensure that you are in the record books, you need to buy the [[Stock|stock]] at least two business days before the date of record, or one day before the ex-dividend date.1

## Example of a [[Record Date]]

Assume company Alpha has declared a dividend of $1, payable on May 1, to shareholders of record as of April 10. The [[Record Date|record date]] is therefore April 10 and the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, or April 9 (if April 9-10 fall mid-week with no holidays.)

If Sam wishes to receive the dividend of $1 per Alpha share, they should buy the [[Stock|stock]] before its ex-dividend date. If they buy Alpha [[Shares|shares]] on April 8, their trade [[Will|will]] settle on April 10; since they are a shareholder of record as of April 10, they will receive the dividend. But if they wait for a day and buy Alpha shares on April 9, which is the ex-dividend date, their trade will only settle on April 11. They would not receive the dividend in this case as they were not a shareholder of Alpha as of the April 10 [[Record Date|record date]].
