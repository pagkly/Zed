[[Shares]]
## What Are [[Shares]]?

[[Shares]] are units of [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Equity|equity]].asp) ownership interest in a corporation that exist as a financial asset providing for an equal distribution in any residual profits, if any are declared, in the form of [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp). Shareholders may also enjoy capital gains if the value of the company rises.

[[Shares]] represent [[Equity|equity]] [[Stock|stock]] in a firm, with the two main types of shares being [[common shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp) and [[preferred shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/preferred-stock-vs-common-stock/). As a result, "shares" and "[stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp)" are commonly used interchangeably.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Shares]] represent [[Equity|equity]] ownership in a corporation or financial asset, owned by investors who exchange capital in [[Return|return]] for these units.
-   Common [[Shares|shares]] enable voting rights and possible returns through price appreciation and dividends.
-   Preferred [[Shares|shares]] do not [[Offer|offer]] price appreciation but can be redeemed at an attractive price and offer regular dividends.
-   Most companies have [[Shares|shares]], but only the shares of publicly-traded companies are found on [[Stock|stock]] exchanges.

## Understanding [[Shares]]

When establishing a corporation, owners may choose to issue [[Common Stock|common stock]] or preferred [[Shares|shares]] to investors. Companies issue [[Equity|equity]] shares to investors in [[Return|return]] for capital, which is used to grow and operate the firm.

Unlike [[Debt|debt]] capital, obtained through a [[Loan|loan]] or bond issue, [[Equity|equity]] has no legal mandate to be repaid to investors, and [[Shares|shares]], while they may pay dividends as a distribution of profits, do not pay interest. Nearly all companies, from small partnerships or LLCs to multinational corporations, issue shares of some kind.

[[Shares]] of [[privately-held]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privately-owned.asp) companies or partnerships are owned by the founders or partners. As small companies grow, shares are sold to outside investors in the [[primary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarymarket.asp). These may include friends or family, and then angel or venture (VC) investors. If the company continues to grow, it may seek to raise additional [[Equity|equity]] capital by selling shares to the public on the [[secondary market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp) via an [[initial share offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO). After an IPO, a company's shares are said to be [[publicly traded]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp) and become [[Listed|listed]] on a [[Stock|stock]] exchange.

Most companies issue common [[Shares|shares]]. These provide shareholders with a residual claim on the company and its profits, providing potential investment growth through both capital gains and dividends. Common shares also come with [[voting rights]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp), giving shareholders more control over the business. These rights allow shareholders of record in a company to vote on certain corporate actions, elect members to the board of directors, and approve issuing new securities or payment of dividends. In addition, certain [[Common Stock|common stock]] comes with [[pre-emptive rights]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preemptiveright.asp), ensuring that shareholders may buy new shares and retain their percentage of ownership when the corporation issues new [[Stock|stock]].

In comparison, preferred [[Shares|shares]] typically do not [[Offer|offer]] much market appreciation in value or voting rights in the corporation. However, this type of [[Stock|stock]] typically has set payment criteria, a dividend that is paid out regularly, making the stock less risky than [[Common Stock|common stock]]. Because [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] takes priority over common stock if the business files for bankruptcy and is forced to repay its lenders, preferred shareholders receive payment before common shareholders but after bondholders. Because preferred shareholders have priority in repayment upon bankruptcy, they are less risky than common shares.

Physical paper [[stock certificates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockcertificate.asp) have been replaced with electronic recording of [[Stock|stock]] [[Shares|shares]]. The issue and distribution of shares in public and private markets is overseen by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) and trading on the secondary market of shares by the SEC and [[FINRA]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp).

[[Shares]] represent the corporation's owners' residual claim on assets after all obligations and debts have been paid. 

## Authorized and Issued [[Shares]]

Authorized [[Shares|shares]] comprise the number of shares a company’s board of directors may issue. Issued shares comprise the number of shares that are given to shareholders and counted for purposes of ownership.

Because shareholders’ ownership is affected by the number of authorized [[Shares|shares]], shareholders may limit that number as they see appropriate. When shareholders want to increase the number of [[authorized shares]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/011315/what-difference-between-authorized-shares-and-outstanding-shares.asp), they conduct a meeting to discuss the issue and establish an agreement. When shareholders agree to increase the number of authorized shares, a formal request is made to the state through filing articles of amendment.

## Example of [[Shares]]

Investors buy [[Shares|shares]] of companies that they believe [[Will|will]] grow and hope to capture some of those capital gains as investors. As the 10-year bull market that began following the 2008 [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]] stretched on, shares of companies continually reached new highs through 2019.

So-called [[FAANG]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fang-[[Stocks|stocks]]-fb-amzn.asp) (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) tech stocks led the market [[Rally|rally]], as their share prices soared by double digits in 2019 on strong earnings results.1 The increasing price meant that investors were willing to pay more to own [[Shares|shares]] of these companies. 

All told, the [[Shares|shares]] of the companies in the S&P 500 Technology Select Sector traded up over 300% from 2010 to February 2020 when shares of all companies on the [[Stock|stock]] market began to experience [[Volatility|volatility]] due to public health, economic, and political uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic.2 After briefly falling in March 2020, the S&P 500 Technology Select Sector has continued to reach new heights.
