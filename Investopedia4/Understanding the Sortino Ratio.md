[[Understanding the Sortino Ratio]]
## What Is the Sortino Ratio?

The Sortino ratio is a variation of the [[Sharpe ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) that differentiates harmful [[Volatility|volatility]] from total overall volatility by using the asset's [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of negative [[Portfolio|portfolio]] returns—[downside deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downside-deviation.asp)—instead of the total standard deviation of portfolio returns. The Sortino ratio takes an asset or portfolio's [[Return|return]] and subtracts the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate, and then divides that amount by the asset's downside deviation. The ratio was named after Frank A. Sortino.

## Formula and Calculation of Sortino Ratio

Sortino Ratio\=Rp−rfσdwhere:Rp\=Actual or expected [[Portfolio|portfolio]] returnrf\=[[Risk]]-free rateσd\=Standard deviation of the downside\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Sortino Ratio} = \\frac{ R\_p - r\_f }{ \\sigma\_d } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &R\_p = \\text{Actual or expected portfolio [[Return|return]]} \\\\ &r\_f = \\text{Risk-free rate} \\\\ &\\sigma\_d = \\text{[[Standard Deviation|Standard deviation]] of the downside} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

### Key Takeaways

-   The Sortino ratio differs from the Sharpe ratio in that it only considers the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the downside [[Risk|risk]], rather than that of the entire ([[Upside|upside]] + downside) risk.
-   Because the Sortino ratio focuses only on the negative deviation of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]'s returns from the mean, it is thought to give a better view of a portfolio's [[Risk|risk]]-adjusted performance since positive [[Volatility|volatility]] is a benefit.
-   The Sortino ratio is a useful way for investors, analysts, and [[Portfolio|portfolio]] managers to evaluate an investment's [[Return|return]] for a given level of bad [[Risk|risk]].

#### What is the Sortino Ratio?

## What the Sortino Ratio Can Tell You

The Sortino ratio is a useful way for investors, analysts, and [[portfolio managers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanager.asp) to evaluate an investment's [[Return|return]] for a given level of bad [[Risk|risk]]. Since this ratio uses only the downside deviation as its risk measure, it addresses the problem of using total risk, or [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]], which is important because [[Upside|upside]] [[Volatility|volatility]] is beneficial to investors and isn't a factor most investors worry about.

## Example of How to Use the Sortino Ratio

Just like the Sharpe ratio, a higher Sortino ratio result is better. When looking at two similar investments, a rational investor would prefer the one with the higher Sortino ratio because it means that the investment is earning more [[Return|return]] per unit of the bad [[Risk|risk]] that it takes on.

For example, assume Mutual Fund X has an annualized [[Return|return]] of 12% and a downside deviation of 10%. Mutual Fund [[Z]] has an annualized return of 10% and a downside deviation of 7%. The [[Risk|risk]]-free rate is 2.5%. The Sortino ratios for both funds would be calculated as:

Mutual Fund X Sortino\=12%−2.5%10%\=0.95\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Mutual Fund X Sortino} = \\frac{ 12\\% - 2.5\\% }{ 10\\% } = 0.95 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Mutual Fund [[Z]] Sortino\=10%−2.5%7%\=1.07\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Mutual Fund Z Sortino} = \\frac{ 10\\% - 2.5\\% }{ 7\\% } = 1.07 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

Even though Mutual Fund X is returning 2% more on an annualized basis, it is not earning that [[Return|return]] as efficiently as Mutual Fund [[Z]], given their downside deviations. Based on this metric, Mutual Fund Z is the better investment choice.

While using the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate of [[Return|return]] is common, investors can also use [[expected return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) in calculations. To keep the formulas accurate, the investor should be consistent in terms of the type of return.

## The Difference Between the Sortino Ratio and the Sharpe Ratio

The Sortino ratio improves upon the Sharpe ratio by isolating downside or negative [[Volatility|volatility]] from total volatility by dividing excess [[Return|return]] by the downside deviation instead of the total [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] or asset.

The Sharpe ratio punishes the investment for good [[Risk|risk]], which provides positive returns for investors. However, determining which ratio to use depends on whether the investor wants to focus on total or [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp), or just downside deviation.
