[[Non-Purpose Loan]]
## What Is a [[Non-Purpose Loan]]?

A [[Non-Purpose Loan|non-purpose loan]] is an alternative type of [[Loan|loan]] that often involves using investment securities as [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp) and relies on complex structuring. Regulated non-purpose loans can be offered by brokerages and financial institutions with some specific government-regulatory documentation requirements.1

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Non-Purpose Loan|non-purpose loan]] is an alternative type of [[Loan|loan]] that uses investment securities as [[Collateral|collateral]] and relies on complex structuring.
-   Even when put up as [[Collateral|collateral]], non-purpose loans allow investors to continue to receive the benefits of their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Holdings|holdings]]—such as dividends, interest and appreciation—without having to sell their investments.
-   Financial institutions must disclose whether a [[Loan|loan]] is a [[Non-Purpose Loan|non-purpose loan]] to the Federal Reserve under [[Regulation U]].1

## How a [[Non-Purpose Loan]] Works

Regulated non-purpose loans allow a borrower to use an investment [[Portfolio|portfolio]] as [[Loan|loan]] [[Collateral|collateral]], though the proceeds cannot be used for purchasing, carrying or trading securities. One advantage of this type of loan is that it gives investors access to funds without having to sell their investments.

Generally, non-purpose loans may also be featured as a lending category across a variety of lending platforms. Typically, lenders [[Will|will]] require a borrower to specify a [[Loan|loan]] purpose for a personal loan. This is especially important with online lending platforms where retail and institutional investors choose to invest in loans by their particular purpose.

Regulations require financial institutions to disclose whether a [[Loan|loan]] is a non-purpose or purpose loan. This is regulated by the Federal Reserve under [[Regulation U]]. Borrowers obtaining a [[Non-Purpose Loan|non-purpose loan]] must complete a compliance form detailing the terms of the loan and its non-purpose obligations.1

### [[Loan]] Platform Categories

In general, online [[Loan|loan]] platforms may also [[Offer|offer]] non-purpose loans which are personal loans obtained by borrowers with no specific purpose for their use. Online lending investors in platforms such as Lending Club or Prosper [[Will|will]] often invest in platform loans based on the loan’s purpose so this classification can also provide consideration in investment [[Risk|risk]] analysis.2 3

Non-purpose loans give investors access to funds without having to sell their investments.

## [[Non-Purpose Loan]] vs. Margin [[Loan]]

Non-purpose loans are considered an alternative to traditional [[margin]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp) borrowing because they allow multiple investment accounts to be used to secure a [[Loan|loan]]. Both non-purpose and margin loans [[Will|will]] allow investors to continue to receive the benefits of their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Holdings|holdings]], such as dividends, interest and appreciation. Both are also subject to a [[margin call]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) if the value of the pledged securities declines below the specified limit. Nonetheless, there are differences between these two types of borrowing.

Non-purpose loans are typically marketed as securities backed lines of credit (SBLOCs). They are generally more complex to obtain than a standard margin [[Loan|loan]]. And, as noted above, they cannot be used to buy securities whereas margin loans are typically used for the sole purpose of investing in securities.

Brokerages [[Offer|offer]] margin loans on individual investment accounts. SBLOCs offer borrowers the opportunity to obtain a [[Loan|loan]] through the use of multiple account investments. Some SBLOCs may require a specific account to obtain the lending proceeds.

## Example of a [[Non-Purpose Loan]]

Charles Schwab provides one example with its Pledged Asset Line of Credit product. Generally, borrowers can access up to 70% of their [[Collateral|collateral]] assets as cash through the [[Loan|loan]] agreement. Terms of up to five years are available and the only applicable fees are late fees. Like all non-purpose loans, the Schwab's Pledged Asset Line cannot be used to buy securities.4
