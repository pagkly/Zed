[[Minimum Lease Payments Defined]]
## What Are Minimum [[Lease]] Payments?

The minimum [[Lease|lease]] payment is the lowest amount that a [[Lessor|lessor]] can expect to make (and a [[Lessee|lessee]] can expect to pay) over the lifetime of the lease. Accountants calculate minimum lease payments in order to assign a present value to a lease in order to record the lease properly in the company's books.

The method of calculating minimum [[Lease|lease]] payments is laid out in the Statement of [[Financial Accounting]] Standards No. 13 (FAS 13), Accounting for Leases, which was published by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fasb.asp) (FASB) in 1980.

### Key Takeaways

-   Minimum [[Lease|lease]] payments refer to the lowest anticipated amount a [[Lessee|lessee]] is expected to pay over the course of a leased asset or property.
-   Present value calculations are utilized to discount future [[Lease|lease]] payments in order to properly account for the time value of money.
-   Minimum [[Lease|lease]] payment estimates employ a 90% test for an asset's recovery of investment, regardless of whether it is a capital or operating lease.

## The Formula for Minimum [[Lease]] Payments and Lease Valuation

The present value formula encompasses the minimum [[Lease|lease]] payments and the value of the total lease. Leased equipment often has a [[Residual Value|residual value]] at the end of the lease term, which is an estimate of the amount of value remaining in the leased asset.

## What Does Calculating Minimum [[Lease]] Payments Tell You?

The minimum [[Lease|lease]] payment calculation is an important part of an accounting analysis called the recovery of investment test (90% test). This test is used to decide whether a lease should be recorded in the company's books as an [[operating]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatinglease.asp) or [[capital lease]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitallease.asp). The accounting treatment for minimum lease payments differs, depending on whether you're the [[Lessee|lessee]] or the [[Lessor|lessor]].

When a company cannot afford to fully purchase equipment or expects it to have a short [[Useful Life|useful life]], it may opt to [[Lease|lease]] the equipment. The [[Lessor|lessor]] owns the equipment and rents it out. The [[lessee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lessee|lessee]].asp) makes regularly scheduled payments to the lessor for the use of the equipment. The lessee is expected to make a minimum payment during the contractual period that the equipment is leased out. The minimum payment is known as the minimum lease payment.

Minimum [[Lease|lease]] payments are rental payments over the lease term including the amount of any [[bargain purchase option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bargain-purchase-option.asp), [[Premium|premium]], and any guaranteed [[residual value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/residual-value.asp), and excluding any rental relating to costs to be met by the [[Lessor|lessor]] and any contingent rentals.

## Special Considerations

Although common sense suggests that the minimum [[Lease|lease]] payments on a 12-month lease at $1,000 a month should be $12,000, this number can be complicated by contractual clauses. Executory costs like maintenance and insurance are usually excluded because they are the responsibility of the [[Lessor|lessor]], but other factors can be added to the cost of a lease.

These include any guarantees made by the [[Lessee|lessee]] to the [[Lessor|lessor]] about the [[Residual Value|residual value]] of the leased property at the end of the [[Lease|lease]] as well as any payments for non-renewal of the lease. Once these are factored in, a reasonable present value can be assigned to the lease for accounting purposes.

## Example of Minimum [[Lease]] Payments and Present Value

The value of a [[Lease|lease]] is estimated by [[discounting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discounting.asp) the minimum lease payments. Let’s use an example to determine how much a lease [[Will|will]] cost in today’s dollars. A company takes out a 3-year lease on a number of heavy-duty trucks.

The minimum [[Lease|lease]] payment per month is $3,000 per month or $36,000 per year. Lessors also charge interest as compensation for leasing their equipment. In this case, the interest rate is 5% per year, or 5% divided by12 months = 0.417% per month.

To calculate the [[present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp) (PV) of the leased trucks, the [[Residual Value|residual value]] must be factored in. The residual value is the value of the trucks after the [[Lease|lease]] period is over. Let’s assume, in this case, that the residual value is $45,000.

The annual interest rate on the [[Lease|lease]] is used as the [[discount rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp) in calculating the PV. The PV on the trucks’ lease can be calculated using the PV formula, and including the residual in the calculation, as follows:

PV\= $36,0001.051+$36,0001.052+$36,0001.053+$45,0001.053\= $34,285.71+$32,653.06+$31,098.83+ $38,873.53\= $136,911.13\\begin{aligned} PV =& \\ \\frac{ \\$\\text{36,000} }{ 1.05^1 } + \\frac { \\$\\text{36,000} }{ 1.05^2 } + \\frac {\\$\\text{36,000} }{1.05^3 } + \\frac { \\$\\text{45,000} }{ 1.05^3 } \\\\ =& \\ \\$\\text{34,285.71} + \\$\\text{32,653.06} + \\$\\text{31,098.83} +\\\\ &\\ \\$\\text{38,873.53} \\\\ =& \\ \\$\\text{136,911.13} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

In today’s value, the [[Lease|lease]] [[Will|will]] be estimated to cost $136,911.13.
