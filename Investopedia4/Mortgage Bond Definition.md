[[Mortgage Bond Definition]]
## What is Mortgage Bond?

A mortgage bond is secured by a mortgage, or a pool of mortgages, that are typically backed by real [[Estate|estate]] [[Holdings|holdings]] and [[real property]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-property.asp), such as equipment.

### Key Takeaways

-   A mortgage bond is a bond backed by real [[Estate|estate]] [[Holdings|holdings]] or [[Real Property|real property]].
-   In the event of a [[Default|default]] situation, mortgage bondholders could sell off the [[Underlying|underlying]] property backing a bond to compensate for the default.
-   Mortgage bonds tend to be safer than corporate bonds and, therefore, typically have a lower rate of [[Return|return]].

## Understanding Mortgage Bonds

Mortgage bonds [[Offer|offer]] the investor protection because the [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) is secured by a valuable asset. In the event of [[Default|default]], mortgage [[bondholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp) could sell off the [[Underlying|underlying]] property to compensate for the default and secure payment of dividends. However, because of this inherent safety, the average mortgage bond tends to [[Yield|yield]] a lower [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) than traditional [[corporate bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp) that are backed only by the corporation's promise and ability to pay.

When a person buys a home and finances the purchase with a mortgage, the [[Lender|lender]] rarely retains ownership of the mortgage. Instead, it sells the mortgage on the secondary market to another entity, such as an investment bank or [[government-sponsored enterprise]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp) (GSE). This entity packages the mortgage with a pool of other loans and issues bonds with the mortgages as backing.

When homeowners pay their mortgages, the interest portion of their payment is used to pay the [[Yield|yield]] on these mortgage bonds. As long as most of the homeowners in the mortgage pool keep up with their payments, a mortgage bond is a safe and reliable income-producing [[Security|security]].

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Mortgage Bonds

A disadvantage of mortgage bonds is that their yields tend to be lower than corporate bond yields because the [[securitization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitization.asp) of mortgages makes such bonds safer investments. An advantage would that if a homeowner defaults on a mortgage, the bondholders have a claim on the value of the homeowner's property. The property can be liquidated with the proceeds used to compensate bondholders. Another advantage of mortgage bonds is that they are a safer investment than [[Stocks|stocks]], for example.

In contrast, investors in corporate bonds have little to no recourse if the corporation is unable to pay. As a result, when corporations issue bonds, they must [[Offer|offer]] higher yields to entice investors to shoulder the [[Risk|risk]] of [[Unsecured|unsecured]] [[Debt|debt]].

## Special Considerations for Mortgage Bonds

One major exception to the general rule that mortgage bonds represent a safe investment became evident during the [[financial crisis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp) of the late 2000s. Leading up to this period, investors realized they could earn higher yields purchasing bonds backed by [[subprime mortgages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-meltdown.asp)—mortgages offered to buyers with poor credit or unverifiable income—while still enjoying the supposed [[Security|security]] of investing in collateralized [[Debt|debt]].

Unfortunately, enough of these subprime mortgages defaulted to cause a crisis during which many mortgage bonds defaulted costing investors millions of dollars. Since the crisis, there has been heightened scrutiny over such securities. Nevertheless, the Fed still holds a sizable amount of [[mortgage-backed securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp) (MBS) such as mortgage bonds. As of Feb. 2021, the Fed held around $2.1 trillion in MBS, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.1
