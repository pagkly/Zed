[[Prospect Theory]]
## What Is the [[Prospect Theory]]?

[[Prospect Theory|Prospect theory]] assumes that losses and [[gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/[[Gain|gain]].asp) are valued differently, and thus individuals make decisions based on perceived gains instead of perceived losses. Also known as the "loss-aversion" theory, the general concept is that if two choices are put before an individual, both equal, with one presented in terms of potential gains and the other in terms of possible losses, the former option [[Will|will]] be chosen.

## How the [[Prospect Theory]] Works

[[Prospect Theory|Prospect theory]] belongs to the [[behavioral economic]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioraleconomics.asp) subgroup, describing how individuals make a choice between probabilistic alternatives where [[Risk|risk]] is involved and the probability of different outcomes is unknown. This theory was formulated in 1979 and further developed in 1992 by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, deeming it more psychologically accurate of how decisions are made when compared to the expected utility theory.

The [[Underlying|underlying]] explanation for an individual’s behavior, under [[Prospect Theory|prospect theory]], is that because the choices are independent and singular, the probability of a [[Gain|gain]] or a loss is reasonably assumed as being 50/50 instead of the probability that is actually presented. Essentially, the probability of a gain is generally perceived as greater.

### Key Takeaways

Although there is no difference in the actual gains or losses of a certain product, the [[Prospect Theory|prospect theory]] says investors [[Will|will]] choose the product that offers the most perceived gains.

Tversky and Kahneman proposed that losses cause a greater emotional impact on an individual than does an equivalent amount of [[Gain|gain]], so given choices presented two ways—with both [[Offering|offering]] the same result—an individual [[Will|will]] pick the option offering perceived gains.

For example, assume that the end result is receiving $25. One option is being given the straight $25. The other option is gaining $50 and losing $25. The utility of the $25 is exactly the same in both options. However, individuals are most likely to choose to receive straight cash because a single [[Gain|gain]] is generally observed as more favorable than initially having more cash and then suffering a loss.

## Types of [[Prospect Theory]]

According to Tversky and Kahneman, the certainty effect is exhibited when people prefer certain outcomes and [[Underweight|underweight]] outcomes that are only probable. The certainty effect leads to individuals avoiding [[Risk|risk]] when there is a prospect of a sure [[Gain|gain]]. It also contributes to individuals seeking risk when one of their options is a sure loss.

The isolation effect occurs when people have presented two options with the same outcome, but different routes to the outcome. In this case, people are likely to cancel out similar information to lighten the cognitive load, and their conclusions [[Will|will]] vary depending on how the options are framed.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Prospect Theory|prospect theory]] says that investors value gains and losses differently, placing more weight on perceived gains versus perceived losses.
-   An investor presented with a choice, both equal, [[Will|will]] choose the one presented in terms of potential gains.
-   The [[Prospect Theory|prospect theory]] is part of behavioral [[Economics|economics]], suggesting investors chose perceived gains because losses cause a greater emotional impact.
-   The certainty effect says individuals prefer certain outcomes over probable ones, while the isolation effect says individuals cancel out similar information when making a decision.

## [[Prospect Theory]] Example

Consider an investor is given a pitch for the same [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) by two separate financial advisors. One advisor presents the fund to the investor, highlighting that it has an average [[Return|return]] of 12% over the past three years. The other advisor tells the investor that the fund has had above-average returns in the past 10 years, but in recent years it has been declining. [[Prospect Theory|Prospect theory]] assumes that though the investor was presented with the exact same mutual fund, he is likely to buy the fund from the first advisor, who expressed the fund’s [[rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp) as an overall [[Gain|gain]] instead of the advisor presenting the fund as having high returns and losses.
