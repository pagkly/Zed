[[Ultra ETF Definition]]
## What Is an Ultra ETF?

An ultra ETF is a class of [[exchange-traded fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (ETF) that employs [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp) in an effort to amplify the [[Return|return]] of a set benchmark. Since first arriving on the scene in 2006, ultra ETFs have grown to include different ETFs with [[Underlying|underlying]] benchmarks ranging from broad market indexes, such as the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, to specific sectors, such as technology, healthcare, and basic materials.

Ultra ETFs are also known as [leveraged ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveraged-etf.asp) or geared funds.

### Key Takeaways

-   An ultra ETF is a class of exchange-traded fund (ETF) that employs [[Leverage|leverage]] in an effort to amplify the [[Return|return]] of a set benchmark.
-   They use financial derivatives and [[Debt|debt]] to increase the impact of price movements, [[Offering|offering]] to double, triple or more the long or short performance of a given [[Underlying|underlying]] index.
-   Due to the high-[[Risk|risk]], high-cost structure of ultra ETFs, they are best suited to quick trading strategies.

## Understanding an Ultra ETF

ETFs are funds that invest in a basket of [[securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/[[Security|security]].asp) from the [[index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) that they track. They generally aim to achieve the same returns as their benchmark by replicating its [[Holdings|holdings]], [[Offering|offering]] investors the opportunity to mimic the performance of the broader [[Equity Market|equity market]] or, in other cases, [[Gain|gain]] complete exposure to a specific sector or trend.

A traditional exchange-traded fund usually tracks the securities in its [[Underlying|underlying]] index on a one-to-one basis, meaning that if, for example, the S&P moves 1 percent, an S&P ETF [[Will|will]] also move by 1 percent. Alternative ones, often referred to as ultra ETFs, seek to be more aggressive. These [[Marketable Securities|marketable securities]] use [financial derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/[[Derivative|derivative]]/) and [[Debt|debt]] to amplify returns, [[Offering|offering]] to double, triple or more the [[long]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) or short performance of a given underlying index.

### Important:

Leveraging is an investing strategy that involves using borrowed funds to buy options and [[Futures|futures]] to increase the impact of price movements.

Increased daily [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) is both the biggest benefit and greatest danger of ultra ETFs. They are best suited to short-term investing strategies or quick [[trading]](https://www.investopedia.com/trading-4427765) to maximize a given bet in the market — due to the high-[[Risk|risk]], high-cost structure of ultra ETFs, they are rarely used as long-term investments.

According to the [prospectuses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp) for these funds, ultra ETFs may not achieve double or more the [[Return|return]] of the benchmark during [[flat]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flat.asp) markets. Long-term returns may also diverge from the desired performance target. The ultra ETFs' only aim is to amplify the daily return — a goal they have succeeded in fairly accurately in the short time they can be analyzed. 

## Benefits of an Ultra ETF

If an investor is convinced, say, that the S&P 500 is about to rise, he or she [[Will|will]] probably want to explore ways to make as much money as possible from this conviction. An ultra ETF can cater to those needs, without incurring the additional expenses and stress of trading on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp) — a process whereby a broker lends money to a customer so that he or she can purchase [[Stocks|stocks]] or other securities with the securities held as [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp) for the [[Loan|loan]].

Ultra ETFs can be beneficial to tactical investors who are short on [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) or allocation space within a diversified [[portfolio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp). For instance, they can invest 5 percent of their portfolios into an ultra ETF and [[Gain|gain]] closer to 10 percent exposure due to the leveraged returns.

## Limitations of an Ultra ETF

[[Leverage]] is a double-edged sword: It can lead to significant gains, as well as significant losses. The use of leverage magnifies not only the [[Return|return]] potential of these ETFs but also the [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp), making these investments riskier than non-leveraged ETFs targeting the same index or investment style. In other words, these vehicles are not for the average investor.

Ultra ETFs represent just a small portion of the total ETF universe, accounting for approximately $49 billion, or 3.6 percent of the $1.4 trillion total ETF market as of January 2021.12

Anyone looking to make long-term, buy and [[Hold|hold]] investments should also steer clear of ultra ETFs. Daily [[Rebalancing|rebalancing]] and [[compounding]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp), combined with [[Leverage|leverage]], [[Will|will]] cause investment results to diverge significantly over time from expectations. This is due to the wide variance of performance that make standard performance measures such as the [geometric mean](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071113/breaking-down-geometric-mean.asp) of limited use.

Potential payoffs can be significantly impaired by charges, too. Because of their complexity and use of borrowed funds, ultra ETFs carry much higher [[expense ratios]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp) than standard ETFs. The average fee for regular ETFs is roughly 0.5 percent, or $5.00 for every $1,000 invested in January 2021.1 Ultra ETFs, on the other hand, usually come with expense ratios of 1 percent or more.2

## Special Considerations

Ultra ETFs also enable investors to amplify their returns when [[shorting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp), or betting against, an [[Underlying|underlying]] index.

[Inverse](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverse-etf.asp) ultra ETFs**,** or ultra shorts, use [[Leverage|leverage]] to make extra money when a market declines in value. When used properly, they allow sophisticated investors to [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) existing long positions with short exposure.
