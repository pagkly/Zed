[[Writ of Attachment]]
## What Is a [[Writ of Attachment]]?

A [[Writ of Attachment|writ of attachment]] is a form of prejudgment process in which a court orders the attachment or seizure of property described in the writ. The property is seized and held in the custody of an appointed official, such as a U.S. Marshal or law enforcement officer, under court supervision.1

A [[Writ of Attachment|writ of attachment]] demands the [[Creditor|creditor]]'s property prior to the outcome of a trial or [[judgment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/judgement.asp), whereas a [[writ of execution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writ-of-execution.asp) directs law enforcement to begin the transfer of property as the result of the conclusion of a legal judgment.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Writ of Attachment|writ of attachment]] is a court order demanding a [[Debtor|debtor]]'s property be seized prior to a judgment in the [[Creditor|creditor]]'s favor.
-   A [[Writ of Attachment|writ of attachment]] may be used in bankruptcy cases and in eviction cases (when a tenant [[Will|will]] not leave on their own and will not pay rent).
-   In the event that the judge rules in favor of the [[Debtor|debtor]], the property [[Will|will]] be returned unto them.
-   If the [[Creditor|creditor]] instead prevails, the seized property may be sold at auction to satisfy the unpaid debts.

## How a [[Writ of Attachment]] Works

A [[writ]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writ.asp) of attachment is generally used to freeze a defendant's assets pending the outcome of legal action. That is, the plaintiff—who is the party bringing the legal action against the defendant—obtains a contingent [[lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp) on the defendant's assets. The lien is a legal charge to take ownership of the defendant's property to satisfy a [[Debt|debt]]. The [[Writ of Attachment|writ of attachment]] allows the lien to be exercised should the plaintiff successfully obtain a judgment against the defendant.

There are several different types of attachment.

-   A [[garnishment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/[[Garnishment|garnishment]].asp) is a court order directing a [[Third Party|third party]] to seize assets, such as wages or money, from a person's paycheck or bank account to settle an unpaid [[Debt|debt]].
-   A writ of replevin is usually put in place to take property held by a person wrongfully, while [[sequestration]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sequestration.asp) preserves the property pending litigation.2 3

In [[Debt|debt]] collection outside of [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) action, a [[Writ of Attachment|writ of attachment]] from the civil court system is one tool available to creditors. It allows plaintiffs to place a legal claim on a defendant's assets early on in the judicial process before a judgment is even entered.

This form of judicial [[Lien|lien]] provides a two-fold benefit as it protects the plaintiff's right and ability to collect on any future judgment. It also provides [[Leverage|leverage]] to negotiate a settlement with the defendant earlier in the process.

## Requirements for a [[Writ of Attachment]]

Most jurisdictions at the state and federal level allow plaintiffs to obtain writs of attachment, although the agencies and procedures involved may differ. Typical courts require a claim be:

-   One for money, based on a contract
-   Of a fixed amount or a readily ascertainable amount
-   [[Unsecured]] or not fully secured
-   Of a commercial nature

To obtain a [[Writ of Attachment|writ of attachment]]—as with any form of judicial relief—you must first file a civil lawsuit before a court has any authority to take action on your behalf. This requires filing and serving a complaint for recovery of the debts owed to you or your business. After that, or simultaneous with these actions, you can initiate a proceeding to obtain a writ of attachment, usually requiring a hearing before the court.
