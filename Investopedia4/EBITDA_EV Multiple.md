EBITDA/EV Multiple
## What is EBITDA/EV Multiple?

The EBITDA/EV multiple is a financial valuation ratio that measures a company's [[Return|return]] on investment (ROI). The EBITDA/EV ratio may be preferred over other measures of return because it is normalized for differences between companies. Using EBITDA normalizes for differences in capital structure, [[Taxation|taxation]], and fixed asset accounting. The enterprise value (EV) also normalizes for differences in a company's capital structure.

### Key Takeaways

-   The EBITDA/EV multiple is a financial valuation ratio used to calculate a company's ROI.
-   EBITDA/EV ratio is more complicated than other [[Return|return]] measures, but it often used because it provides a normalized ratio for measuring the operations of different companies.
-   The enterprise value (EV) ratio harmonizes within the capital structure of a company.

## Understanding EBITDA/EV Multiple

EBITDA/EV is a comparables analysis method that seeks to value similar companies using the same financial metrics. While computing the EBITDA/EV ratio is more complicated than other [[Return|return]] measures, it is sometimes preferred because it provides a normalized ratio for comparing the operations of different companies.

If a more conventional ratio (such as [[net income to equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp)) were used, comparisons would be skewed by each company's accounting policies.

An analyst using EBITDA/EV assumes that a particular ratio is applicable and can be applied to various companies operating within the same line of business or industry. In other words, the theory is that when firms are comparable, this [[multiples approach]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiplesapproach.asp) can be used to determine the value of one firm based on the value of another. Thus, EBITDA/EV is commonly used to compare companies within an industry.

This is a modification of the ratio of operating and non-operating profits compared to the [[market value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp) of a company's [[Equity|equity]] plus its [[Debt|debt]]. Since EBITDA is often considered a proxy for cash income, the metric is used as a measure of a company's cash [[Return|return]] on investment.

## EBITDA and EV

"[EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp)" is an acronym that stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. However, the measure is not based on the U.S. [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)|generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)]].

In April 2016, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) stated non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA would be a focal point for the agency to ensure that companies are not presenting results in a misleading manner. If EBITDA is shown, the SEC advises that the company should reconcile the metric to [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp). This should assist investors by providing information on how the figure is calculated.

[Enterprise value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp) (EV) is a measure of the [[Economic Value|economic value]] of a company. It is frequently used to determine the value of the business if it is acquired. It is considered to be a better valuation measure than [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp), since the latter factors in only a business' [[Equity|equity]] without regard to the [[Debt|debt]].

EV is calculated as the [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] plus [[Debt|debt]], [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]], and [[minority interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minorityinterest.asp), minus cash. An entity purchasing a company would have to pay the value of the [[Equity|equity]] and assume the debt, but the money would reduce the price paid.

## An Example of EBITDA/EV

The EBITDA/EV uses the cash flows of a business to evaluate the value of a company.When the EBITDA is compared to enterprise revenue, an investor can tell if a business has [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] issues. A business with healthy cash flow [[Will|will]] have a high value. Banks also look at EBITDA since it is an indicator on the capacity of the enterprise to pay the [[Debt Service|debt service]] and repay the [[Principal|principal]] of any new [[Debt|debt]] incurred.

For example, Wal-Mart Inc.'s EBITDA for the fiscal year 2020, was $31.55 billion. Its enterprise value was $445.77 billion during this period. This works out to an EBITDA/EV multiple of 0.07077 or 7.08%.

The reciprocate multiple [[EV/EBITDA]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ev-ebitda.asp) is used to measure the value of a company.
