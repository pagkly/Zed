[[Vega Neutral Definition]]
## What Is Vega [[Neutral]]?

Vega [[Neutral|neutral]] is a method of managing [[Risk|risk]] in options trading by establishing a [[Hedge|hedge]] against the implied [[Volatility|volatility]] of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset.

Vega is one of the options Greeks along with [[delta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp), [[gamma]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp), [[rho]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rho.asp) and [[theta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/theta.asp). Vega is the Greek that corresponds with the [[Black-Scholes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp) price factor for [[Volatility|volatility]], but it represents the sensitivity of the price of an option to volatility and not volatility itself. An options trader [[Will|will]] use a vega [[Neutral|neutral]] strategy when he believes that volatility presents a [[Risk|risk]] to the profits.

## How Vega [[Neutral]] Works

Vega [[Neutral|neutral]] is not as popular as the neutral positions for the other Greeks. Vega essentially tells traders how a 1% change in the [[implied volatility (IV)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp) of an option affects the price. So vega is a measure of how sensitive the option [[Premium|premium]] itself is to [[Volatility|volatility]]. A vega neutral position is a way for options traders to remove that sensitivity from their calculations. If a position is vega neutral, it doesn't make or lose money when the implied volatility changes.

## Building a Vega [[Neutral]] [[Portfolio]]

The vega of a single position is displayed on all the major trading platforms. To calculate the vega of an options [[Portfolio|portfolio]], you simply sum up the vegas of all the positions. The vega on short positions should be subtracted by the vega on long positions (all [[Weighted|weighted]] by the lots). In a vega [[Neutral|neutral]] portfolio, total vega of all the positions [[Will|will]] be zero.

## Example of Vega [[Neutral]]

For example, if an options trader has 100 lots of $100 strike calls that have a vega of $10 each, the trader [[Will|will]] look to short the same [[Underlying|underlying]] product to eliminate $1,000 worth of vega—say 200 lots of $110 strike calls with a vega of $5.

This is oversimplifying it, however, as it doesn't take into account different expirations or any other complexities. In fact, if the the options have different expiry dates, it becomes difficult to achieve true vega neutrality because implied [[Volatility|volatility]] [[Will|will]] generally not move by the same amount in options with different terms.

The implied [[Volatility|volatility]] term structure shows that most options have a fluctuating IV depending on the expiration month. To deal with the expiration issue, a time-[[Weighted|weighted]] vega can be used with the caveat that it is making a big assumption in that the IV is mainly influenced by the time to expiry.

Similarly, if a trader is seeking to create a vega [[Neutral|neutral]] position with options on different [[Underlying|underlying]] products, they have to be very confident in the degree of [[Correlation|correlation]] between the two underlying products’ IV. 

Vega [[Neutral|neutral]] strategies are usually attempting to profit from the bid-ask spread in implied [[Volatility|volatility]] or the skew between the implied volatility in puts and calls. That said, vega neutral is more often used in combination with other Greeks, as in a [[Delta Neutral|delta neutral]]/vega neutral trade or a long gamma/vega neutral trade.
