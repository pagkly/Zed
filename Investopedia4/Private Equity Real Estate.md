## Understanding [[Private Equity Real Estate]]

[Private equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp) real [[Estate|estate]] funds allow [high-net-worth individuals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hnwi.asp) (HWNIs) and institutions like endowments and pension funds to invest in [[Equity|equity]] and [[Debt|debt]] [[Holdings|holdings]] related to real estate assets. Using an [active management strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activemanagement.asp), [[Private Equity Real Estate|private equity real estate]] takes a [diversified](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversifiedfund.asp) approach to property ownership. [General partners](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalpartner.asp) (GPs) invest in a variety of property types in different locations, which can range from new development and raw land holdings to complete redevelopment of existing properties, or cash-flow injections into struggling properties.

Investing in [[Private Equity Real Estate|private equity real estate]] requires an investor with a long-term outlook and a significant upfront [[capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) commitment (over $250,000 initially and follow-on investments over time). Little flexibility and [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Liquidity|liquidity]].asp) are offered to investors since the capital commitment window typically requires several years.

[Lock-up periods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lockup-period.asp) for [[Private Equity Real Estate|private equity real estate]] can sometimes last for more than a dozen or more years. Also, [[distributions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution.asp) can be slow because they are often paid from [[Cash Flow|cash flow]] rather than outright liquidation (investors have no right to demand a liquidation). Fund managers typically charge a [2-and-20 fee structure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two_and_twenty.asp), costing investors 2% of invested assets per year plus 20% of profits.

[[Private Equity Real Estate|Private equity real estate]] investing is risky, but it can also provide high returns.

## [[Private Equity Real Estate]] Returns

Despite the lack of flexibility and [[Liquidity|liquidity]], this type of investment can provide high potential levels of income with strong price appreciation. Annual returns in the 6% to 8% range for core strategies and 8% to 10% for core-plus strategies are not uncommon. Returns for value-added or opportunistic strategies can be considerably higher. That said, [[Private Equity Real Estate|private equity real estate]] is risky enough that investors can lose their entire investment if a fund underperforms.

Funds created for individual investors generally require that the investment be funded at the time of the signing of the investment agreement, whereas funds created for [[institutional investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) require a capital commitment. That capital is then drawn down as suitable investments are made. If no investments are made during the investment period specified by the agreement, nothing can be drawn from the commitment.
