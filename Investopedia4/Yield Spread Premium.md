[[Yield Spread Premium]]
## What is a [[Yield Spread Premium]]?

A [[Yield Spread Premium|yield spread premium]] also called a "YSP" is a form of compensation that a [[Mortgage Broker|mortgage broker]], acting as the intermediary, receives from the original [[Lender|lender]] for selling an interest rate to a borrower that is above the lender's par rate for which the borrower qualifies.

The YSP can be used to cover costs associated with the [[Loan|loan]], so the borrower isn't on the hook for additional fees. Since new legislation was passed in 1999, the [[Yield Spread Premium|yield spread premium]] must now be reasonably related to services the [[Mortgage Broker|mortgage broker]] performs for the home buyer. The [[Yield|yield]] spread [[Premium|premium]] must be disclosed on the [[HUD-1 Form]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hud-1.asp) when the loan is closed.

## How [[Yield Spread Premium]] Works

Mortgage brokers are compensated directly by borrowers when the borrower pays an origination fee when the [[Lender|lender]] pays the broker a [[Yield Spread Premium|yield spread premium]] or a combination of these. If there is no origination fee, the borrower is most likely agreeing to pay an interest rate above the market rate.

### Key Takeaways

-   The YSP is [[Listed|listed]] on the HUD-1 from when the [[Loan|loan]] has been paid off.
-   [[Yield Spread Premium|Yield spread premium]] is one of many fees associated with purchasing a piece of property or a home.
-   In 1999, legislation designed to protect homebuyers against exorbitant [[Yield|yield]] spread fees.Â 

Paying an interest rate above-market rates to compensate a [[Mortgage Broker|mortgage broker]]/[[Lender|lender]] is not necessarily a bad thing for the borrower, as it can reduce the mortgage's upfront costs.

If the borrower expects to [[Hold|hold]] the mortgage for a short time, paying a relatively high-interest rate can be more economical than paying high fees up front. A thorough analysis should be performed before any contracts are signed.
