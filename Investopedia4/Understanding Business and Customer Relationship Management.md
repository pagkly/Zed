Understanding Business and Customer Relationship Management
## What Is Relationship Management?

Relationship management is a strategy in which an organization maintains an ongoing level of engagement with its audience. This management can occur between a business and its customers ([business to consumer \[B2C\]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp)) or between a business and other businesses ([business to business \[B2B\]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btob.asp)). Relationship management aims to create a partnership between an organization and its patrons, instead of viewing the relationship as merely transactional. 

## Understanding Relationship Management

Relationship management involves strategies to build client support for a business and its offerings, and increase brand loyalty. Most often, relationship building occurs at the customer level, but it is valuable between businesses as well.

A business may hire a relationship manager to oversee relationship building or it may combine this function with another marketing or human-resources role. Building a relationship with clients yields rewards for all parties. Consumers who feel that a company is responsive to their needs likely will continue to use that company's products and services.

A company's reputation for responsiveness and generous post-sales involvement can often stimulate new sales. Maintaining communication with consumers lets a company identify potential problems before they come to a costly head.

### Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

B2C businesses rely on customer relationship management (CRM) tools to build a solid rapport with their customers. CRM involves a significant amount of data and sales analysis as it seeks to understand [[market trends]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031815/what-strategies-do-companies-employ-increase-market-share.asp), the economic landscape, and consumer tastes. CRM also can include marketing techniques and a post-sales support program.

Typically, a [[CRM program]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer_relation_management.asp) will consist of written media (such as sales announcements, newsletters, and post-sale surveys), video media communication (such as commercials), and tutorials. Ongoing marketing is critical to a business, as it is more costly to acquire a new customer than it is to maintain a current customer. Marketing helps a business to gauge consumers' interests and needs, and develop campaigns to maintain loyalty.

### Business Relationship Management (BRM)

B2B relationships with vendors, suppliers, distributors, and other associates can also benefit from relationship management. Business relationship management (BRM) promotes a positive and productive relationship between a company and its business partners. BRM seeks to build trust, solidify rules and expectations, and establish boundaries. It also can help with dispute resolutions, contract negotiations, and [[cross-sale]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross-sell.asp) opportunities.
