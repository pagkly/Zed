[[Investment Time Horizon Definition]]
## What Is an Investment Time Horizon?

An investment time horizon, or just time horizon, is the period of time one expects to [[Hold|hold]] an investment until they need the money back. Time horizons are largely dictated by investment goals and [[strategies]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/060815/comparison-bucket-strategy-vs-systematic-withdrawals.asp). For example, saving for a down payment on a house, for maybe two years, would be considered a short-term time horizon, while saving for college would be a medium-term time horizon, and investing for retirement, a long-term time horizon.

#### Understanding [[Risk]] And Time Horizon

### KEY Takeaways

-   Time horizons are periods where investments are held until they are needed.
-   Time horizons vary according to the investment goal, short or long.
-   Time horizons also vary according to the time by which you begin investing.
-   The longer the time horizon, the longer the power of compounding has to work.
-   Generally speaking, the longer the time horizon, the more aggressive an investor can be in their [[Portfolio|portfolio]], and vice versa.

## The Basics of Investment Time Horizons

An investment time horizon is the period where one expects to [[Hold|hold]] an investment for a specific goal. Investments are generally broken down into two main categories: [[Stocks|stocks]] (riskier) and bonds (less risky). The longer the time horizon, the more aggressive, or riskier, [[Portfolio|portfolio]] an investor can build. The shorter the time horizon, the more conservative, or less risky, the portfolio the investor may want to adopt.

## An Example of an Investment Time Horizon

Let’s say two people marry, and while they live in the city now, they’d eventually like to move out to the suburbs in a few years. But they don’t have the money for a down payment on a house, so they’ll need to start saving up. That’s a short-term investment horizon, so they’ll probably want to go with something relatively conservative, like a [[Money Market|money market]] fund, to avoid any sharp swings in [[Stocks|stocks]].

Meanwhile, they’ve both taken advantage of their employers' [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) savings funds (an employer-sponsored retirement fund, sometimes with employer matching). And since they’re both young, that’s a long-term time horizon. Given the length of time until their retirement, they can afford to be very aggressive in their asset allocation, upwards of 90% of [[Stocks|stocks]], as the long investment horizon should allow their [[Portfolio|portfolio]] to recover from any short-term downturns.

Next, a baby comes along! Now they have to start thinking about saving for college. That’s more of a medium- or long-term goal, so they can be pretty aggressive in the beginning and then turn a little more conservative as high school graduation for the child comes along. But there is a government saving plan ([529](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp)) that allows your contributions to grow tax free, as long as they’re used for educational expenses.
