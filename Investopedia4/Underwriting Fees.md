[[Underwriting Fees]]
## What are [[Underwriting Fees]]

[[Underwriting Fees|Underwriting fees]] are [[monies]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money.asp) collected by underwriters for performing [[underwriting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp) services. Underwriters work in a variety of markets including investments, mortgages, and insurance. In each situation, the underwriter's jobs vary slightly yet each collects underwriting fees in exchange for his or her underwriting services.

## BREAKING DOWN [[Underwriting Fees]]

In [capital markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp), [[Underwriting Fees|underwriting fees]] are collected by underwriters who administer the issuing and distributing of certain [[financial instruments]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp). When companies issue [[Stock|stock]], bonds or other publicly traded securities, for instance, it hires an underwriter.

The issuing company and the underwriter work closely together to determine the price of an [[Offering|offering]]. After determining the [[Offer|offer]] structure, underwriters assemble a group of investment banks and brokerage firms that commit to selling a certain percentage of the offering. After an underwriting agreement is struck, the underwriter bears the [[Risk|risk]] of being unable to sell the [[Underlying|underlying]] securities and the cost of holding them on its books until they can be sold. Once the underwriter knows it [[Will|will]] sell all of the [[Shares|shares]] in the offering, it closes the offering by purchasing all the shares from the company (if the offering is a guaranteed offering), and the issuer receives the proceeds minus the [[Underwriting Fees|underwriting fees]], usually 3 to 7 percent of the amount of capital being raised.

Underwriters or [[underwriter syndicates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter-syndicate.asp) earn [[Underwriting Fees|underwriting fees]] for doing three things: negotiating and managing the [[Offering|offering]], assuming the [[Risk|risk]] of buying the securities (if nobody else [[Will|will]]), and managing the sale of the [[Shares|shares]].

## [[Underwriting Fees]] for Mortgage Underwriters

A mortgage underwriter earns [[Underwriting Fees|underwriting fees]] by evaluating and verifying mortgage [[Loan|loan]] applications and either approving or denying the loan.

An underwriting fee for the service of evaluating the [[Loan|loan]] application for approval is a nonrecurring fee that the [[Lender|lender]] may charge in lieu of an [[origination fee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/origination-fee.asp), or in addition to it. Origination fees pay for numerous costs associated with obtaining a loan and could include administrative services, such as loan processing and [[Mortgage Broker|mortgage broker]] fees. Other loan fees can include an appraisal, a credit report, flood certification, and a tax service fee. When charged apart from origination, underwriting costs between $400 and $900, depending on the lender and loan type.

## [[Underwriting Fees]] for Insurance Underwriters

Insurance underwriters collect [[Underwriting Fees|underwriting fees]] for identifying and calculating a policyholder's [[Risk|risk]] of loss and by writing the policies to cover these risks. An insurance underwriter's job is to protect the company's book of business from risks that they feel [[Will|will]] make a loss and issue insurance policies at a [[Premium|premium]] that is appropriate for the risk exposure.
