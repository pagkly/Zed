[[Hardship Exemption]]
## What Is a [[Hardship Exemption]]?

A [[Hardship Exemption|hardship exemption]] is an event that prevents an individual from obtaining health insurance. This approved exception prevents the person from paying a penalty for not having health insurance during the hardship period. A hardship exemption can be granted if an individual is in a situation that affects his or her ability to purchase health coverage. Hardship exemptions are a provision in the Patient Protection and [[Affordable Care Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affordable-care-act.asp) (ACA), signed into law on March 23, 2010. Starting in 2014, most individuals were required to have an acceptable health-coverage level - known as [[minimum essential coverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum-essential-coverage.asp) - or [[pay a fee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fee.asp) (individual shared responsibility payment). In certain cases, people can qualify for exemptions, including hardship exemptions, whereby no penalty is assessed9. As of 2019, the penalty for not having [[health insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp) is eliminated; the exemptions below apply to the 2015-2018 tax years.

### Key Takeaways

-   Hardship exemptions are circumstances that prevent an individual from securing health insurance.
-   The [[Hardship Exemption|hardship exemption]] prevents the individual from being assessed a penalty for not having health insurance during the hardship period.
-   Beginning in 2019, the penalty, also known as the Shared Responsibility Payment, for not having health insurance no longer applies.
-   Some notable hardship exemptions are homelessness and being a victim of domestic violence.

## Understanding Hardship Exemptions

Hardship exemptions typically covered the month prior to the hardship, the hardship period, and the month after the hardship. However, for some exceptions, the [[Hardship Exemption|hardship exemption]] period could be extended up to a calendar year (e.g., people ineligible for [[Medicaid]] because their state has not expanded Medicaid coverage). A hardship exemption may be granted for these accepted circumstances:

-   Homelessness
-   You have been evicted in the last six months or are facing [[foreclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp).
-   You received a shut-off notice from a utility company.
-   You were the victim of domestic violence.
-   Within the last 3 years, you experienced the death of a close family member.
-   You experienced a fire, flood, or another disaster (natural or man-made) that resulted in substantial damage to your property.
-   You filed for [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) within the previous six months.
-   You had medical expenses you were unable to pay in the last 24 months.
-   You had unexpected increases in necessary expenses related to caring for an ill, disabled, or aging family member.
-   On your taxes, you expect to claim a child who has been denied coverage in [[Medicaid]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/[[Medicaid|medicaid]].asp) and CHIP, and another person is under a court order to provide medical support for the child (in this case, you do not owe the penalty for the child).
-   As a result of an eligibility appeals decision, you are eligible for a qualified health plan (QHP) through the Marketplace, lower costs on your monthly premiums, or cost-sharing reductions for a period when you were not enrolled in the QHP.
-   You are ineligible for [[Medicaid]] because your state did not expand its eligibility under the ACA.

Four more exemptions have since been added under the Trump Administration. If you:

-   Live in an area where there are no [[marketplace]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/health-insurance-marketplace.asp) plans.
-   Live in an area where there is just one insurer selling marketplace plans.
-   Can’t find an [[affordable marketplace]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/020714/new-taxes-under-affordable-care-act.asp) plan that doesn’t cover abortion.
-   Experience “personal circumstances” that make it difficult for them to buy a marketplace plan, including not being able to find a plan in their area that gives them access to specialty care they need.

Eligible individuals can apply for a [[Hardship Exemption|hardship exemption]] through the Health Insurance Marketplace.
