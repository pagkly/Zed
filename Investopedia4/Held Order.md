[[Held Order]]
## What is a [[Held Order]]?

A [[Held Order|held order]] is a market order that requires prompt execution for an immediate fill. In most cases, the trader is expected to hit the best [[Offer|offer]] for buy orders or accept the best bid for sell orders. The opposite order type, a not-held order, provides traders with both time and price discretion to try and get a better fill.

## Understanding Held Orders

When filling a [[Held Order|held order]], traders have very little discretion in finding a price because time is scarce. Typically, they [[Will|will]] be required to match the highest bid or lowest [[Offer|offer]] to facilitate an immediate transaction. For example, if the [[bid-ask market spread]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) in Apple Inc. is $182.50 / $182.70 and a trader receives a held order to purchase 100 [[Shares|shares]], she would place a buy order at the offer price of $182.70, which would be executed immediately under normal market conditions. Held orders are used by investors who need to change their exposure to a particular [[Stock|stock]] and want their order(s) executed without delay.

## When to Use a [[Held Order]]

Most investors want to get the best price they can get, but there are two situations where held orders are ideal for:

1.  **Trading Breakouts:** A [[Held Order|held order]] could be used to enter the market on a [[breakout]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp) if the trader wants an immediate entry into a [[Stock|stock]] and is not concerned about slippage costs. Slippage occurs if a [[market maker]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) alters the spread to their advantage after receiving a market order. In a fast-moving stock, traders are often prepared to pay slippage to ensure they receive an instant fill.
2.  **Closing an Error Position:** Traders may place a [[Held Order|held order]] to [[Unwind|unwind]] an error position they want to close immediately to reduce [[downside risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downsiderisk.asp). For example, an investor may realize he has purchased the wrong [[Stock|stock]] and would place a held order to quickly reverse the position before he buys the correct [[Security|security]].

## When Not to Use a [[Held Order]]

One area where it is better to avoid using a [[Held Order|held order]] is when you are dealing in [[illiquid]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp) [[Stocks|stocks]]. Suppose a [[Small Cap|small cap]] [[Stock|stock]] has a wide bid-ask market spread of $1.50 / $2.25. A trader who uses a held order is forced to pay the 33.3% spread ($0.75 / $2.25) to get prompt execution. In this instance, the trader may get a better price if he uses discretion and sits at the top of the bid and incrementally increases the order price to entice a seller out of the woodwork. Of course, the 33.3% spread may be a reasonable price to pay if the trader is playing a breakout or closing a position that was a [[fat finger error]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fat-finger-error.asp) to begin with.
