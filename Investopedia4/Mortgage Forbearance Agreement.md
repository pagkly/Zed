[[Mortgage Forbearance Agreement]]
## What Is a [[Mortgage Forbearance Agreement]]?

A mortgage [[forbearance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/[[Forbearance|forbearance]].asp) agreement is an agreement made between a [[mortgage lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-guide/mortgage-lenders/) and a [[delinquent]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delinquent.asp) borrower. In this agreement, a [[Lender|lender]] agrees not to exercise its legal right to foreclose on a mortgage, and the borrower agrees to a mortgage plan that [[Will|will]]—over a certain time period—bring the borrower current on their payments.

The coronavirus outbreak has triggered [[forbearance help from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/[[Economics|economics]]/08/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-credit-crisis.asp). Between these two institutions, they guarantee more than two-thirds of all mortgages and 95% of mortgage-backed securities.

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Mortgage Forbearance Agreement|mortgage forbearance agreement]] is a plan made between a [[Lender|lender]] and a borrower who is struggling to make mortgage payments that attempts to allow the borrower to fulfill the mortgage obligation and avoid foreclosure.
-   The agreement generally reduces or entirely suspends mortgage payments for a set time period during which the [[Lender|lender]] agrees not to foreclose on the property.
-   It is intended for borrowers with temporary financial problems and is not considered a long-term solution.
-   In some cases, a [[Lender|lender]] may agree to extend a [[Mortgage Forbearance Agreement|mortgage forbearance agreement]] beyond its initial end date.

## How a [[Mortgage Forbearance Agreement]] Works

A [[Mortgage Forbearance Agreement|mortgage forbearance agreement]] is made [[when a borrower has a difficult time meeting their payments]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/110415/7-solutions-homeowners-struggling-their-mortgage.asp). With the agreement, the [[Lender|lender]] agrees to reduce—or even suspend entirely—mortgage payments for a certain period of time. They also agree not to initiate a [[foreclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp) during the [[Forbearance|forbearance]] period.

The borrower must resume the full payment at the end of the period, plus pay an additional amount to get current on the missed payments, including [[Principal|principal]], interest, taxes, and insurance. The terms of the agreement [[Will|will]] vary among lenders and situations. 

A mortgage [[Forbearance|forbearance]] agreement is not a long-term solution for delinquent borrowers. Rather, it is designed for borrowers who have temporary financial problems caused by unforeseen problems, such as temporary [[Unemployment|unemployment]] or health issues. Borrowers with more-fundamental financial problems––such as having chosen an [[adjustable-rate mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp) on which the interest rate has reset to a level that makes the monthly payments unaffordable––must usually seek other remedies.

A [[Forbearance|forbearance]] agreement may allow a borrower to avoid foreclosure until their financial situation gets better. In some cases, the [[Lender|lender]] may be able to extend the forbearance period if the borrower’s hardship is not resolved by the original agreed-upon end date.

A [[Loan|loan]] modification is meant to be a permanent solution to unaffordable monthly mortgage payments through renegotiation of the mortgage terms rather than the temporary suspension or reduction of payments.

## Mortgage [[Forbearance]] Agreements vs. [[Loan]] Modifications

While a [[Mortgage Forbearance Agreement|mortgage forbearance agreement]] provides short-term relief for borrowers, a [[loan modification agreement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan_modification.asp) is a permanent solution to unaffordable monthly payments. With a [[Loan|loan]] modification, the [[Lender|lender]] can work with the borrower to do a few things—such as reduce the interest rate, convert from a variable interest rate to a [[fixed interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp), or extend the length of the loan term—in order to reduce the borrower’s monthly payments.

In order to be eligible for a [[Loan|loan]] modification, borrowers must show that they cannot make the current mortgage payments because of financial hardship, demonstrate that they can afford the new payment amount by completing a trial period, and provide all required documentation to the [[Lender|lender]]. The documentation the lender requires varies by lender, but it may include a financial statement, proof of income, tax returns, bank statements, and a hardship statement.

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have instituted a number of emergency measures designed to help homeowners dealing with the economic repercussions of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

## Special Considerations

### Special Provisions for COVID-19 Economic Impact

Fannie and Freddie released essentially identical sets of guidelines for borrowers and lenders about single-family mortgages:1 2

-   Homeowners “adversely impacted by this emergency,” in the words of Fannie Mae, “may request mortgage assistance by contacting their mortgage servicer.”
-   Mortgage [[Forbearance|forbearance]] [[Will|will]] be provided to reduce or suspend payments for up to 12 months.
-   Foreclosure sales and evictions are suspended until at least Mar. 31, 2021, as directed by an executive order signed by President Biden on his first day in office.
-   Lenders must suspend reports to credit bureaus of past-due payments for borrowers in a [[Forbearance|forbearance]] plan.
-   There [[Will|will]] be no penalties or late fees for homeowners in a [[Forbearance|forbearance]] plan.
-   After [[Forbearance|forbearance]], the [[Lender|lender]] is mandated to “work with the borrower on a permanent plan to help maintain or reduce monthly payment amounts as necessary, including a [[Loan|loan]] modification,” states Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac is “[[Offering|offering]] loan modification options to provide mortgage payment relief or keep those payments the same after the forbearance period.”
-   Beginning July 1, 2020, Freddie Mac is “[[Offering|offering]] a payment deferral solution in which your deferred payments [[Will|will]] be due at the end of the [[Loan|loan]].” Fannie Mae promises that “following your [[Forbearance|forbearance]], you are _not required_ to repay missed payments all at once, but you have that option.”3
