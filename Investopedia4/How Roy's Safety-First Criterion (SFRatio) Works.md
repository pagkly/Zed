[[How Roy's Safety-First Criterion (SFRatio) Works]]
## What Is Roy's Safety-First Criterion – SFRatio?

Roy's safety-first criterion, also known as the SFRatio, is an approach to investment decisions that sets a minimum required [[Return|return]] for a given level of [[risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]].asp). Roy's safety-first criterion allows investors to compare potential [[Portfolio|portfolio]] investments based on the probability that the portfolio returns [[Will|will]] fall below their minimum desired return threshold.

## The Formula for the SFRatio Is

SFRatio\=re−rmσpwhere:re\=Expected [[Return|return]] on portfoliorm\=Investor’s minimum required returnσp\=Standard deviation of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]]\\begin{aligned} &SFRatio = \\frac{r\_e-r\_m}{\\sigma\_p}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &r\_e = \\text{Expected return on portfolio}\\\\ &r\_m = \\text{Investor's minimum required return}\\\\ &\\sigma\_p = \\text{[[Standard Deviation|Standard deviation]] of the portfolio}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

## How to Calculate Roy's Safety-First Criterion – SFRatio

The SFRatio is calculated by subtracting the minimum desired [[Return|return]] from the [[expected return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] and dividing the result by the [[standard deviation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) of [[portfolio returns]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio-return.asp). The optimal portfolio [[Will|will]] be the one that minimizes the probability that the portfolio's return will fall below a threshold level.

## What Does Roy's Safety-First Criterion Tell You?

The SFRatio provides a probability of getting a [[minimum-required return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp) on a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. An investor's optimal decision is to choose the portfolio with the highest SFRatio. Investors can use the formula to calculate and evaluate various scenarios involving different asset-class weights, different investments and other factors that affect the probability of meeting their minimum [[Return|return]] threshold.

Some investors feel that Roy's safety-first criterion is a [[risk-management]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032415/how-investment-[[Risk|risk]]-quantified.asp) philosophy in addition to being an evaluation method. By choosing investments that adhere to a minimum acceptable [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Return|return]], an investor can sleep at night knowing that her investment [[Will|will]] achieve a minimum return, and anything above that is "gravy."

The SFRatio is very similar to the [[Sharpe ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp); for normally distributed returns, the minimum [[Return|return]] is equal to the [[Risk|risk]]-free rate.

-   Roy's safety-first rule measures the minimum [[Return|return]] threshold an investor has for a [[Portfolio|portfolio]].
-   Also known as the SFRatio, investors can use the formula to compare different investing scenarios to choose the one most likely to hit their required minimum [[Return|return]].

## Example of Roy's Safety-First Criterion

Assume three portfolios with various expected returns and standard deviations. [[Portfolio]] A has an expected [[Return|return]] of 12% with a [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of 20%. Portfolio B has an expected return of 10% with a standard deviation of 10%. Portfolio C has an expected return of 8% with a standard deviation of 5%. The threshold return for the investor is 5%.

Which [[Portfolio|portfolio]] should the investor choose? SFRatio for A: (12 - 5) / 20 = 0.35; B: (10 - 5) / 10 = 0.50; C: (8 - 5) / 5 = 0.60. Portfolio C has the highest SFRatio and thus should be selected.
