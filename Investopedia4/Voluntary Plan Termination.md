[[Voluntary Plan Termination]]
## What Is [[Voluntary Plan Termination]]?

[[Voluntary Plan Termination|Voluntary plan termination]] is the discontinuance of a [[defined-benefit plan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedbenefitpensionplan.asp) by an employer. Since an employer is not legally required to provide a retirement plan to employees, it can terminate an established plan.

However, an employer can terminate a voluntary plan only if all of the requirements for a standard termination or distress termination are followed by the plan administrator. Section 4041 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations addresses voluntary plan terminations.

### Key Takeaways:

-   An employer can terminate a voluntary retirement plan since they are not legally required to provide a retirement plan to employees.
-   An employer might terminate a plan if they are facing bankruptcy, involved in a merger acquisition, or switching to another plan.
-   The plan administrator must follow Section 4041 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations when conducting a [[Voluntary Plan Termination|voluntary plan termination]].
-   Affected participants can usually roll over the distributed money to another qualified plan.

## Understanding [[Voluntary Plan Termination]]

According to the [[Internal Revenue Service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS), since an employer isn’t required by law to provide a retirement plan for employees, it can terminate its retirement plan.

An employer might terminate a plan for the following reasons:

-   A decision to terminate the plan
-   If the firm is facing bankruptcy
-   If the business is to be sold to another company or purchased by another company
-   If the employer is switching to an alternative retirement plan

Under a [[Voluntary Plan Termination|voluntary plan termination]], the assets must be distributed to participants in a manner described by federal law. The employer has the unilateral right to modify or end the retirement plan at any time. This right is set out by the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erisa.asp).

The allocation of plan assets is usually done by the plan administrator or [[Trustee|trustee]]. An employer must distribute assets from a terminated plan as soon as administratively feasible after the plan is terminated. Affected participants can usually roll over the distributed money to another qualified plan or [[individual retirement account]](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-590-a) (IRA).

The IRS states: "For terminated defined benefit plans with insufficient money to pay all of the benefits, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [[Will|will]] guarantee the payment of vested pension benefits up to limits set by law.

For terminated defined contribution plans (for example, 401(k), 403(b) or profit-sharing), participants generally receive the full amount of their vested account balance upon plan termination."1

In a defined benefit plan termination, Form 6088 (reporting the distributable benefits) must be submitted along with a signed and dated actuary’s certification of the adjusted funding target percentage.

### Partial Plan Termination

A plan may be partially terminated if more than 20% of plan participants were laid off in a particular year. Partial terminations may be connected with a significant corporate event such as a closed office location or as a result of adverse [[Economic Conditions|economic conditions]].

The law requires all affected employees to be fully vested in their account balance as of the date of a full or partial plan termination.
