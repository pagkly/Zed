[[Hull-White Model]]
## What Is the [[Hull-White Model]]?

The [[Hull-White Model|Hull-White model]] is a single-factor interest model used to price [[derivatives]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp). The Hull-White model assumes that short rates have a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] and that the short rates are subject to mean reversion. [[Volatility]] is likely to be low when short rates are near zero, which is reflected in a larger mean reversion in the model. The Hull-White model extends the [[Vasicek Model]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vasicek-model.asp) and [[Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cox-ingersoll-ross-model.asp) model.

## The [[Hull-White Model]] Explained

Investments whose values are dependent upon interest rates, such as bond options and mortgage-backed securities, have grown in popularity as financial systems have become more sophisticated. Determining the value of these investments often entailed using different models, with each model having its own set of assumptions. This made it difficult to match the [[Volatility|volatility]] parameters of one model with another model, and also made it difficult to understand [[Risk|risk]] across a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of different investments.

Like the Ho-Lee model, the [[Hull-White Model|Hull-White model]] treats interest rates as normally distributed. This creates a scenario in which interest rates are negative, though there is a low probability of this occurring as a model output. The Hull-White model also prices the [[Derivative|derivative]] as a function of the entire [[Yield Curve|yield curve]], rather than at a single point. Because the [[Yield|yield]] curve estimates future interest rates rather than observable market rates, analysts [[Will|will]] [[Hedge|hedge]] against different scenarios that [[Economic Conditions|economic conditions]] might create.

## Who Are Hull and White?

John C. Hull and Alan D. White are [[Finance|finance]] professors at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. Together they developed the model in 1990. Professor Hull is the author of _Risk Management and Financial Institutions_ and _Fundamentals of [[Futures]] and Options Markets_. Professor White, also recognized internationally as an authority on financial engineering, is the Associate Editor of the _Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis_ and the _Journal of Derivatives_.
