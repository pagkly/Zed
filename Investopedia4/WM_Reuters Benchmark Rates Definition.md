WM/Reuters Benchmark Rates Definition
## What are WM/Reuters Benchmark Rates

WM/Reuters FX benchmark rates are spot and forward [[foreign exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp) rates that are used as standard rates for portfolio [[valuation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp) and performance measurement. The WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate service was introduced in 1994 to provide standard [[forex]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp) rates that would enable portfolio valuations to be compared more accurately against each other and financial benchmarks, without having to account for currency [[differentials]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/differential.asp).1

The WM/Reuters FX [[benchmark]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) rates are provided by [[Thomson Reuters]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reuters.asp), which acquired the rate calculation business of the World Markets Company (WM) from State Street in 2016.2 

## Basics of WM/Reuters Benchmark Rates

The original WM/Reuters service provided closing spot rates for 40 currencies daily. The service has since expanded to 155 closing spot currencies covered on an hourly basis. In addition, WM/Reuters also provides closing rates for [[currency forwards]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyforward.asp) and [[non-deliverable forwards]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ndf.asp) (NDF) hourly [[intraday]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intraday.asp) for spot, forward and NDF rates, as well as historical data.1

While most major equity and bond index compilers use the WM/Reuters benchmark rates in their calculations, the rates are also used for other purposes such as calculating benchmark rates for the settlement of financial [[derivatives]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp). Some banks also provide a service to their clients by providing a guarantee to trade at the WM/Reuters rates.

### Key Takeaway

-   The WM/Reuters Benchmark rates are spot and forward exchange rates used as standard rates for portfolio valuation and performance measurement.

## How Rates are Determined

The WM/Reuters benchmark rates are determined over a five-minute fix period, from 2 minutes 30 seconds before to 2 minutes 30 seconds after the time of the fix, which is generally 4 p.m. in London. During this five-minute window, bid and offer rates from the order matching system and actual [[trades]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade.asp) executed are captured. Since trades occur in milliseconds, only a sample is captured, rather than every trade. The [[median]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp) bid and offer are calculated using valid rates over the fix period, and the mid-rate is then calculated from them.1

The importance of these rates lies in the fact that they are used to value trillions of dollars in investments held by [[money managers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymanager.asp) and [[pension funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp). In 2013, the method of fixing the WM/Benchmark rates came under intense scrutiny, after widespread allegations of [[collusion]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collusion.asp) and rate manipulation by traders surfaced.3
