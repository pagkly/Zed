## Understanding the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

The Department of Health and Human Services was originally founded as a Cabinet-level department in 1953 as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). In 1979, the Department of Education Organization Law created a separate Department of Education. The remaining agencies were reorganized as the Department of Health and Human Services on May 4, 1980.3

HHS implements parts of the [[Affordable Care Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affordable-care-act.asp), enforces the [[HIPAA Privacy Rule]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hipaa.asp), ensures that human-subject research conducted by Department-funded institutions obeys regulations, and operates the Head Start program for children.
