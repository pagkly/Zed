[[Home Equity]]
## What Is [[Home Equity]]?

[[Home Equity|Home equity]] is the value of a homeowner’s interest in their home. In other words, it is the [[Real Property|real property]]’s current market value (less any liens that are attached to that property). The amount of [[Equity|equity]] in a house—or its value—fluctuates over time as more payments are made on the [mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) and market forces impact the current value of the property.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Home Equity|Home equity]] is the value of the homeowner’s interest in their home.
-   An owner can [[Leverage|leverage]] their [[Home Equity|home equity]] in the form of [[Collateral|collateral]] to secure either a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]], a traditional home [[Equity|equity]] line of credit (HELOC), or a fixed-rate HELOC.
-   A large down payment on a home (over 20%) [[Will|will]] immediately provide a homeowner with more [[Equity|equity]] in their home than a smaller down payment.

## How [[Home Equity]] Works

If a portion—or all—of a home, is purchased via a mortgage [[Loan|loan]], the lending institution has an interest in the home until the loan obligation has been met. [[Home Equity|Home equity]] is the portion of a home's current value that the owner actually possesses at any given time.

[[Equity]] in a house is initially acquired with the down payment you make during the initial purchase of the property. After that, more equity is achieved through your [[mortgage payments]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-calculator-5084794), since a contracted portion of that payment [[Will|will]] be assigned to bring down the outstanding [[Principal|principal]] you still owe on the [[Loan|loan]]. You can also benefit from property value [[appreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appreciation.asp) because it will cause your equity value to increase.

[[Home Equity|Home equity]] is an asset; it is considered a portion of an individual's [[Net Worth|net worth]], but it is not a [[Liquid Asset|liquid asset]].

## Special Considerations

### [[Home Equity]] Loans

Unlike other investments, [[Home Equity|home equity]] cannot be quickly converted into cash. The [[Equity|equity]] calculation is based on a current market value [[appraisal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp) of your property. But that appraisal is no guarantee that the property would sell at that price. 

However, an owner can [[Leverage|leverage]] their [[Home Equity|home equity]] as [[Collateral|collateral]] to secure either a [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]] or a home [[Equity|equity]] line of credit (HELOC), or [[fixed-rate HELOC]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/fixed-rate-option/), which is a kind of home equity [[Loan|loan]] and HELOC hybrid.

A [[home equity loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequityloan.asp), sometimes referred to as a [[second mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondmortgage.asp), usually allows you to borrow a lump sum against your current [[Home Equity|home equity]] for a fixed rate over a fixed period of time. Many home [[Equity|equity]] loans are used to [[Finance|finance]] large expenditures, such as home repairs or college tuition.

A [[home equity line of credit (HELOC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/) is a revolving line of credit usually with an adjustable interest rate, which allows you to borrow up to a certain amount over a period of time. HELOCs work in a manner similar to credit cards, where you can continuously borrow up to an approved limit while paying off the balance.

## Example of [[Home Equity]]

If a homeowner purchases a home for $100,000 with a 20% down payment (covering the remaining $80,000 with a mortgage), the owner has [[Equity|equity]] of $20,000 in the house. If the market value of the house remains constant over the next two years, and $5,000 of mortgage payments are applied to the [[Principal|principal]], the owner would possess $25,000 in [[Home Equity|home equity]] at the end of the two year period.

If the market value of the home had increased by $100,000 over those two years, and that same $5,000 from mortgage payments were applied to the [[Principal|principal]], the owner would then have a [[Home Equity|home equity]] of $125,000.
