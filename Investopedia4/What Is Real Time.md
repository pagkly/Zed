[[What Is Real Time]]?
## What Is Real-Time?

Real-time is when a system relays information to a user at a speed that is near-instantaneous or has a short delay from when the event occurred. [[Online brokerages]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-brokers-4587872) often provide a real-time data feed that displays [[Stock|stock]] quotes and their respective real-time changes, with a very insignificant lag time, so that clients can base their investing decisions on the most up-to-date information.

### Key Takeaways

-   Real-time refers to information that is relayed at the time it happens, or with only a short delay.
-   In financial markets, real-time is a reference to the price of a [[Security|security]]; the accuracy of the pricing is crucial to market participants.
-   Many financial networks, web sites, and apps provide delayed quotes, which show where a [[Stock|stock]] or currency stood 15 or 20 minutes ago.
-   Some brokerages and certain paid services that traders use provide real-time, up-to-the-minute quotes.

## Understanding Real-Time

While many financial websites do [[Offer|offer]] free [[stock quotes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockquote.asp) to the general public, many of these feeds are not real-time and may be delayed up to 20 minutes. Therefore, when viewing [[Stock|stock]] quotes from any financial website, be aware of the time that is posted near the stock [[Quote|quote]] to verify whether the quote is actually in real-time.

Possessing accurate real-time quotes is especially important for traders, as even the smallest time discrepancy between a provided [[Quote|quote]] and the real-time situation can change a profitable position into a loss.

For rapid intra-day traders, especially, it can be critical to get real-time quotes instead of delayed quotes.

## Real-Time vs. Delayed [[Stock]] Quotes

[[Stock]] quotes reflect the results of actual trading on stock market exchanges, such as the [[New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/103103.asp). Investors and traders can get quotes on the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp), other indices or individual [[Stocks|stocks]] from any number of financial news sources. However, some financial news services don’t report real-time information and instead delay stock quotes for 15 or 20 minutes. 

Actively traded [[Stocks|stocks]] can fluctuate price dramatically from minute to minute or from second to second. That's why knowing the current price is imperative. In a rapidly rising or falling market, also known as a fast market, even real-time quotes can have a hard time keeping up. In that market scenario, a [[Quote|quote]] that’s delayed 15 or 20 minutes is virtually useless, as a [[Stock|stock]] could have moved by a significant percentage in that time frame.  

Delayed quotes are usually enough information for a casual investor who isn’t looking to time the market. For example, if a trader has a long-term [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of [[Stocks|stocks]] they don’t intend to sell, they don’t need up-to-the-second price information. Delayed provide a general ballpark of where stocks and indexes are, and whether they are trending up or down.

Providing real-time quotes takes effort and technology; thus, this service has a cost. If firms don’t want to absorb this cost, they’ll only [[Offer|offer]] delayed quotes. Reuters, for example, provides lots of financial information, but its [[Stock|stock]] quotes are delayed at least 15 minutes.1 Financial news services often offer real-time quotes as a [[Premium|premium]] subscription service.
