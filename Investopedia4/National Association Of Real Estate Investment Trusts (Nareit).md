[[National Association Of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit)]]
## What Is National Association Of Real [[Estate]] Investment Trusts?

The [[National Association Of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit)|National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit)]] is a trade association that deals with [[real estate investment trusts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) (REITs) and serves as the industry’s voice to policymakers, investors and the general public. Nareit represents a diverse industry that includes commercial [[Equity|equity]] REITs, mortgage REITs, REITs traded on major [[Stock|stock]] exchanges, public non-[[Listed|listed]] REITs and private REITs, which collectively own nearly $3 trillion worth of real [[Estate|estate]] assets. Its mission is to advocate for REIT-based real estate investment with policymakers and the global investment community and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from real estate investment.

Based in Washington, D.C., Nareit works as a lobbyist for the industry when dealing with legislators and policymakers from America and around the world. It is run by an independent executive board led by President and CEO Steven A. Wechsler. The organization recently [[updated its brand identity]](https://www.reit.com/nareit/nareit-has-new-look) and messaging, changing itself from being known as NAREIT to Nareit.

## Understanding [[National Association Of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit)]]

Nareit is made up of a community of industry professionals, academics and companies that work together to promote the real [[Estate|estate]] industry and REITs. Nareit represents over 200 member organizations that collaborate to make investing in income-producing real estate simpler and more widely accessible through the purchase of [[Stock|stock]]. Through Nareit, individuals are able to access comprehensive industry data on the overall real estate industry and the performance of member REITs.

On September 14, 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation which created a new approach to income-producing real [[Estate|estate]] investment. On the next day, September 15, 1960, the National Association of Real Estate was incorporated, which later evolved into the organization now known as Nareit. It has since partnered with several foreign entities in its political endeavors, namely the British FTSE Group and the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA). Together, these groups have established the FTSE EPRA/ Nareit Global Real Estate Index Series, which highlights general trends in eligible real estate equities worldwide. In October 2016, Nareit created a [[Real Estate Sustainability Council (RESC)]](https://www.reit.com/nareit/reits-[[Sustainability|sustainability]]) to increase its focus on promoting sustainability and environmental, social and governance best practices.
