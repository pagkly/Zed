[[Omega Defintion]]
## What is Omega?

Omega is a measure of option pricing, similar to the option [[Greeks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greeks.asp) that measures various characteristics of the option itself. Omega measures the percentage change in an option's value with respect to the percentage change in the [[Underlying|underlying]] price. In this way, it measures the [[leverage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Leverage|leverage]].asp) of an options position.

The formula is as follows:

Ω\=Percent Change in VPercent Change in Swhere:V\=Price of the optionS\= [[Underlying]] price\\begin{aligned} &\\Omega = \\frac{\\text{Percent Change in }V}{\\text{Percent Change in }S}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &V = \\text{Price of the option}\\\\ &S = \\text{ Underlying price}\\\\ \\end{aligned}

Omega is the third [[derivative]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Derivative|derivative]].asp) of the option price, and the derivative of gamma. It is also known as [[elasticity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elasticity.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   The third [[Derivative|derivative]] of the option price, Omega measures the effect of an option's [[Leverage|leverage]].
-   Omega is not always reference among option greeks.
-   This variable is used most often by option market makers or other sophisticated, high-volume option traders.

## How Omega Works

Traders use options for many reasons, but one of the most important is [[Leverage|leverage]]. A small investment in a [[call option]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), for example, allows the trader to control a larger dollar value of the [[underlying security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-[[Security|security]].asp). In other words, a call option trading at $25.00 per contract, or $250, could control 100 [[Shares|shares]] of a [[Stock|stock]] trading at $50 per share with a value of $5,000. The holder has the right, but not obligation, to purchase those 100 shares at a specific price (the [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp)) by a certain date.

To see [[Leverage|leverage]] in action, assume Ford Motor Co. [[Shares|shares]] increase 7% in a given period and a Ford call option increases 3% in that same period. The omega of the call option is 3 ÷ 7, or 0.43. This would imply that for every 1% Ford [[Stock|stock]] moves, the call option [[Will|will]] move 0.43%.

## Options Greeks

Omega is calculated based on two of the standard option Greeks, Delta and Gamma. This set of metrics give a sense of an [[options contract's]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) [[Risk|risk]] and reward with respect to different variables. The most common option Greeks are:

[Delta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp) (Δ): Change in option value with respect to change in [[Underlying|underlying]] price.

[Theta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/theta.asp) (Θ): Change in option value with respect to change in time to expiration.

[Rho](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rho.asp) (ρ): Change in option value with respect to change in [[Risk|risk]]-free interest rate.

Omega (Ω): Percent change in option price with respect to percent change in [[Underlying|underlying]] price.

[Vega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vega.asp) (v): Change in option value with respect to change in [[Underlying|underlying]] [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp). (Vega is not the name of a Greek letter.)

Another common Greek is a second-order variable, [[gamma]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp) (Γ): the [[Derivative|derivative]] of delta, it measures the change in delta with respect to the change in the [[Underlying|underlying]] price. 

## Relationship to Delta

An option's gamma is also the [[rate of change]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofchange.asp) in its delta and may be called the delta of the delta.

The equation for omega can also be expressed:

Ω\=∂V∂S×SV\\Omega=\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}\\times\\frac{S}{V}

Given that the equation for delta is:

Δ\=∂V∂S\\Delta=\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}

omega can be expressed in terms of delta as:

Ω\=Δ×SV\\Omega=\\Delta\\times\\frac{S}{V}
