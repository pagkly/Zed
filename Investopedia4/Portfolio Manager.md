[[Portfolio Manager]]
## What Is a [[Portfolio Manager]]?

A [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] is a person or group of people responsible for investing a mutual, exchange traded or closed-end fund's assets, implementing its [[investment strategy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstrategy.asp), and managing day-to-day [[Portfolio|portfolio]] trading. A portfolio manager is one of the most important factors to consider when looking at fund investing. Portfolio management can be active or passive, and historical performance records indicate that only a minority of active fund managers consistently beat the market.1

### Key Takeaways

-   A [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] is a person or group of people responsible for investing a fund's assets, implementing the fund's investment strategies, and managing day-to-day [[Portfolio|portfolio]] management.
-   [[Portfolio]] managers can take an active or passive management role.
-   The ability to originate ideas and to employ excellent research skills are just two factors that influence a [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]]'s success.

## Understanding a [[Portfolio Manager]]'s Role

A [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] holds great influence on a fund, no matter if that fund is a closed or open mutual fund, [[Hedge Fund|hedge fund]], venture capital fund or exchange-traded fund. The manager of the fund's [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Will|will]] directly affect the overall returns of the fund. Portfolio managers are thus usually experienced investors, brokers, or traders, with strong backgrounds in financial management and track records of sustained success.

A [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]], regardless of background, is either an [[active or passive manager]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-[[Portfolio|portfolio]]-management.asp). If a manager takes a passive approach, their investment strategy mirrors a specific [[Market Index|market index]]. Using that market index as a benchmark is extremely important since an investor should expect to see similar returns over the [[Long Term|long term]].

Conversely, a manager can take an active approach to investing, which means that they attempt to consistently beat average market returns. In this scenario, the [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] themselves is extremely important, since their investment style directly results in the fund's returns. Potential investors should look at an active fund's marketing material for more information on the investment approach.

## Characteristics of a Good [[Portfolio Manager]]

Regardless of the investment approach, all [[Portfolio|portfolio]] managers need to have very specific qualities [[in order to be successful]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/121515/portfolio-manager-career-path-qualifications.asp). The first is ideation. If the [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] is active, then the ability to have original investment insight is paramount. With over 7,000 active funds to choose from, active investors need to be smart about where they look.2 If the manager takes a passive approach, the originating insight comes in the form of the [[Market Index|market index]] they've decided to mirror. Passive managers must make smart choices about the index.

Additionally, the way in which a [[Portfolio Manager|portfolio manager]] conducts research is very important. Active managers make a list of thousands of companies and pair it down to a list of a few hundred. The shortlist is then given to fund analysts to analyze the [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] of the potential investments, after which the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] manager assesses the companies and makes an investment decision. Passive managers also conduct research by looking at the various market indices and choosing the one best-suited for the fund.
