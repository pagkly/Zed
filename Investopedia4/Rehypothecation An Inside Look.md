Rehypothecation: An Inside Look
## What Is Rehypothecation?

Rehypothecation is a practice whereby banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as [[Collateral|collateral]] by their clients. Clients who permit rehypothecation of their collateral may be compensated either through a lower cost of borrowing or a [[Rebate|rebate]] on fees. In a typical example of rehypothecation, securities that have been posted with a [[Prime Brokerage|prime brokerage]] as collateral by a [[Hedge Fund|hedge fund]] are used by the brokerage to back its own transactions and trades.

### Key Takeaways

-   Rehypothecation occurs when the [[Lender|lender]] uses its rights to the [[Collateral|collateral]] to participate in its own transactions, often with the hopes of financial [[Gain|gain]].
-   Hypothecation occurs when a borrower promises the right to an asset as a form of [[Collateral|collateral]] in exchange for funds.
-   Rehypothecation was a common practice until 2007, but [[Hedge|hedge]] funds became much more wary about it in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse and subsequent credit crunch in 2008-09.

## Understanding Rehypothecation

Rehypothecation was a common practice until 2007, but [[Hedge|hedge]] funds became much more wary about it in the wake of the [[Lehman Brothers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) collapse and subsequent credit crunch in 2008-09. In the United States, rehypothecation of [[Collateral|collateral]] by broker-dealers is limited to 140% of the [[Loan|loan]] amount to a client, under Rule 15c3-3 of the SEC.

Rehypothecation occurs when a [[Lender|lender]] uses an asset, supplied as [[Collateral|collateral]] on a [[Debt|debt]] by a borrower, and applies its value to cover its own obligations. In order to do so, the lender may have access to a variety of assets promised as collateral including tangible assets and various securities.

## Elements of Rehypothecation and Hypothecation

Rehypothecation happens if a customer leaves a number of securities with a [[broker]](https://www.investopedia.com/broker-awards-4587871) as a deposit, most often in a margin account, and the broker then uses the securities as a pledge for the margin on his own margin account or as backing for a [[Loan|loan]].

[Hypothecation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hypothecation.asp) occurs when a [[borrower]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092315/7-best-peertopeer-lending-websites.asp) promises the right to an asset as a form of [[Collateral|collateral]] in exchange for funds. One common example occurs in the primary housing market, where a borrower uses the home he is purchasing as collateral for a mortgage [[Loan|loan]].

Even though the borrower asserts a level of ownership over the property, the [[Lender|lender]] can seize the asset if payments are not made as required. Similar situations occur in other collateralized loans, such as a vehicle [[Loan|loan]], as well as with the setup of margin accounts to support other trading actions.

With rehypothecation, the asset in question has been promised to an institution outside of the borrowerâ€™s original intent.

For example, if a piece of real [[Estate|estate]] functions as [[Collateral|collateral]] on a mortgage [[Loan|loan]] and the [[Lender|lender]] pledges the asset to another financial institution in exchange for a loan, if the mortgage lender fails, the second financial institution may make a claim on the real estate.
