[[What Are Lipper Indexes]]?
Lipper Indexes are indexes that track the [[financial performance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialperformance.asp) of different types of managed fund strategies. Each index is based on the performance of the largest publicly traded funds in the strategy group.

## Breaking Down Lipper Indexes

Lipper Indexes are constructed and managed by Lipper which is owned by Reuters. Lipper manages indexes for nearly every type of [[mutual fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) strategy in the investable market. Public disclosure of Lipper Index performance is provided by the [[Wall Street Journal]](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/mutualfunds-etfs) and here by [Barron’s](http://www.barrons.com/public/page/9_0210-lippermutfndperfavgs.html).

To construct each index, Lipper averages the returns of funds in the investable market that are managed to the Index’s strategy. Funds used for index [[Return|return]] calculations are chosen by [[assets under management]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp). The number of funds used by Lipper to obtain Lipper Index performance varies broadly. Most Lipper Indexes use approximately 30 to 100 funds to obtain index performance.

Lipper Indexes are often included in mutual fund performance reporting. Investment managers may use Lipper and Lipper Index data in reporting for their clients. A Lipper Index may also be used as a mutual fund’s primary benchmark.
