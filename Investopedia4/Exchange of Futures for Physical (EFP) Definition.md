## Example of Exchange of [[Futures]] for Physical

The most common examples of the exchange of [[Futures|futures]] for physical is in the oil and gas sector. This makes sense, as these types of transactions are not done by small traders and speculators. EFPs [[Will|will]] usually involve large commercial and non-commercial traders. Imagine an oil and gas producer is sitting on an inventory of one million barrels on the assumption that prices are trending up. A refiner who is worried about prices going up wants to secure barrels of oil in the future, so they buy 1,000 contracts representing a contract unit of 1,000 barrels, each for a total of one million barrels.

The refiner and the producer get to talking and they realize that a) they are both bullish on the price of oil and b) they can switch positions to fulfill each other’s needs. They agree to a price and delivery date in the future where the producer hands over the physical oil to the refiner—locking in the refiner’s [[Supply|supply]]—and receives the [[Futures|futures]] in [[Return|return]], allowing the producer to continue the bullish position on oil prices. This large transaction is registered with the exchange, but it doesn't impact the price of oil because pricing information is not disclosed. So the refiner has closed out a futures position and the producer has opened one.

## Advantages of Exchange of [[Futures]] for Physical

The obvious question is why not just do the transaction through the market? The answer is simply for the sake of efficiency. Large transactions impact the market as they are executed. This is why large traders sometimes break up transactions over time to reduce the impact of [[slippage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp). Doing the exchange for [[Futures|futures]] outside the market pricing mechanism allows large, offsetting transactions to take place at a decided price. EFP is also used when the [[market depth]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketdepth.asp) is not able to absorb the transaction—for example, a transaction involving thousands of contracts.
