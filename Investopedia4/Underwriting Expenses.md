[[Underwriting Expenses]]
## What Are [[Underwriting Expenses]]?

[[Underwriting Expenses|Underwriting expenses]] are costs and expenditures associated with [[underwriting]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp) activity. Underwriting expenses include a wide range of expenditures, and the exact definition differs for insurers and investment banks. As a major expense category, the lower these expenditures are as a proportion of underwriting activity, the higher the profitability of the insurer or investment bank.

## Understanding [[Underwriting Expenses]]

[[Underwriting Expenses|Underwriting expenses]] are primarily associated with [[insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp) companies as the cost of doing business, which is underwriting insurance policies. For an insurer, underwriting expenses may include [[direct costs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directcost.asp), such as salaries, commissions, actuarial reviews, and inspections, as well as indirect costs, such as accounting, legal, and customer service expenses.

For an [[investment bank]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentbank.asp), underwriting usually relates to the process of underwriting securities for a company's [[initial public offering]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO). [[Underwriting Expenses|Underwriting expenses]] would include such costs as due diligence activities, research, and legal and accounting fees.

## [[Underwriting Expenses]] and the Expense Ratio

For insurance companies, calculating the [[expense ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp) allows for it to determine the portion of [[insurance premiums]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-[[Premium|premium]].asp) (revenue) that must go towards paying [[Underwriting Expenses|underwriting expenses]]. The expense ratio for an insurer is obtained by dividing underwriting expenses by premiums for a given period. Since the profitability of an insurer has an [[inverse correlation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverse-[[Correlation|correlation]].asp) with the expense ratio, insurers strive to keep this ratio in check in order to remain profitable.

Depending on the insurer, the [[Underwriting Expenses|underwriting expenses]] can be vastly different. If the entity is a well-known insurer, it might not have to [[advertise]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advertising-costs.asp) as much. On the other hand, a new insurance company has to advertise significantly, as well as incur expenses in starting a new business and paying stronger salaries and [[commissions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Commission|commission]].asp) to attract [[Premium|premium]] talent to generate business.

Some insurers have low expense ratios because of [[economies of scale]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp); most notably with large national advertising budgets and well-known brand names that help attract customers. Other insurers employ direct-sales techniques to cut out the insurance agents and [[brokers]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050715/how-does-insurance-broker-make-money.asp) and the [[Underwriting Expenses|underwriting expenses]] that come with them.

In the auto insurance industry, for example, GEICO, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK.A](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=brk.a)), and Progressive ([PGR](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=pgr)) have contributed to their own long-term success by eliminating the middleman, similar to how Dell's ([DELL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=dell)) direct sales method gives it a pricing advantage over competitors. Given the presence of the Internet, direct sales methods are more common than they were.

It's important to stress that any [[claims]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp) that insurance companies pay out on insurance policies written are not included as [[Underwriting Expenses|underwriting expenses]]. The expenses are purely the cost of running a business.
