[[Earned Income Credit (EIC)]]
## What Is the [[Earned Income]] Credit?

The [[Earned Income Credit (EIC)|earned income credit (EIC)]] is a tax credit that helps certain U.S. taxpayers with low earned incomes to report for the tax year. The EIC reduces the amount of tax owed on a dollar-for-dollar basis and may result in a [[refund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refund.asp) to the [[taxpayer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/[[Taxpayer|taxpayer]].asp) if the amount of the credit is greater than the amount of tax owed.

Jan. 31 is IRS EITC Awareness Day. Celebrate it by seeing if you or anyone in your network is eligible for the [[Earned Income|earned income]] tax credit.1

## Understanding the [[Earned Income]] Credit

The [[earned income]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/011915/what-difference-between-gross-income-and-earned-income.asp) credit, also known as the [[Earned Income|earned income]] tax credit (EITC) was introduced to keep families out of [[Poverty|poverty]] while encouraging everyone to work.2 The EIC is only available to low-income earners and some middle-income families.

Households that qualify for the EIC can reduce their [[Tax Liability|tax liability]] to zero, in which case they [[Will|will]] owe no [[income taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp) and will be refunded any taxes that were withheld during the year. If the income tax owed is reduced to below zero, the government will issue a tax refund for the difference.3

## How Tax Credits Work

A [[tax credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxcredit.asp) reduces the value of a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]’s [[Liability|liability]], dollar for dollar. For example, an individual with a tax bill of $2,900 who can claim a $529 credit [[Will|will]] owe $2,900 – $529 = $2,371. That lower amount is the total the taxpayer must pay to the [[Internal Revenue Service (IRS)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) for the year.

A tax credit, depending on its size, may even entitle the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] to a refund of taxes paid during the year.

The EIC is one of the most important tax credits available to individual taxpayers.4 The amount of credit that any one individual can claim depends on the person's annual [[income earned]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnedincome.asp) for the tax year and the number of [[qualified dependents]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent.asp) that the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] has. A qualified dependent, according to the IRS, is a child that is related to the taxpayer by birth, adoption, or fostering. The child can also be a sibling or the child of a sibling such as a niece or a nephew. A qualified dependent should be younger than 19, or younger than 24 if a full-time student. In any case, the taxpayer must be older than the dependent, unless the dependent is permanently disabled.5

## Qualifying for [[Earned Income]] Credit

To qualify for the EIC, a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]]’s [[Earned Income|earned income]] and [[adjusted gross income (AGI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp) must be below certain income limits. For the 2020 tax year, the maximum amount of EIC that could be claimed by a single or married taxpayer depending on the number of children in the household is shown in the table below:6

From the table above, a single filer with no dependents earning less than $15,570 is eligible for up to $529 in [[Earned Income|earned income]] credit. On the other hand, a [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] with two children and [[filing jointly]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfj.asp) with her spouse can claim up to a maximum of $5,828 in EIC if the total of the couple’s earned income in 2019 falls below $52,952. A [[spouse who is filing separately]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfs.asp) would not qualify for earned income credit.7

When it's time to pay 2021 taxes, the figures [[Will|will]] increase slightly.8

In addition to the child qualification guidelines and income limits required to qualify a household for the EIC, a number of other eligibility requirements must be met. For instance, to be eligible, the [[Taxpayer|taxpayer]] must be between the ages of 25 and 65 and live in the U.S. for more than half of the tax year if the person does not have qualifying dependents.9
