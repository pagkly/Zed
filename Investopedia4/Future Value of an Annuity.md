[[Future Value of an Annuity]]
## What Is the [[Future Value of an Annuity]]?

The [[Future Value of an Annuity|future value of an annuity]] is the value of a group of recurring payments at a certain date in the future, assuming a particular rate of [[Return|return]], or [[discount rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp). The higher the [[Discount Rate|discount rate]], the greater the annuity's future value.

### Key Takeaways

-   The [[Future Value of an Annuity|future value of an annuity]] is a way of calculating how much money a series of payments [[Will|will]] be worth at a certain point in the future.
-   By contrast, the [[Present Value of an Annuity|present value of an annuity]] measures how much money [[Will|will]] be required to produce a series of future payments.
-   In an [[Ordinary Annuity|ordinary annuity]], payments are made at the end of each agreed-upon period. In an annuity due, payments are made at the beginning of each period.

## Understanding the [[Future Value of an Annuity]]

Because of the [[time value of money]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp), money received or paid out today is worth more than the same amount of money [[Will|will]] be in the future. That's because the money can be invested and allowed to grow over time. By the same logic, a lump sum of $5,000 today is worth more than a series of five $1,000 annuity payments spread out over five years.

Ordinary annuities are more common, but an annuity due [[Will|will]] result in a higher future value, all else being equal.

## Example of the [[Future Value of an Annuity]]

The formula for the future value of an [[ordinary annuity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryannuity.asp) is as follows. (An [[Ordinary Annuity|ordinary annuity]] pays interest at the end of a particular period, rather than at the beginning, as is the case with an [[annuity due]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuitydue.asp).)

P\=PMT×((1+r)n−1)rwhere:P\=Future value of an annuity streamPMT\=Dollar amount of each annuity paymentr\=Interest rate (also known as discount rate)n\=Number of periods in which payments [[Will|will]] be made\\begin{aligned} &\\text{P} = \\text{PMT} \\times \\frac { \\big ( (1 + r) ^ n - 1 \\big ) }{ r } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{P} = \\text{[[Future Value of an Annuity|Future value of an annuity]] stream} \\\\ &\\text{PMT} = \\text{Dollar amount of each annuity payment} \\\\ &r = \\text{Interest rate (also known as [[Discount Rate|discount rate]])} \\\\ &n = \\text{Number of periods in which payments will be made} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

For example, assume someone decides to invest $125,000 per year for the next five years in an annuity they expect to [[compound]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp) at 8% per year. The expected future value of this payment stream using the above formula is as follows:

Future value\=$125,000×((1+0.08)5−1)0.08\=$733,325\\begin{aligned} \\text{Future value} &= \\$125,000 \\times \\frac { \\big ( ( 1 + 0.08 ) ^ 5 - 1 \\big ) }{ 0.08 } \\\\ &= \\$733,325 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

With an annuity due, where payments are made at the beginning of each period, the formula is slightly different. To find the [[Future Value of an Annuity|future value of an annuity]] due, simply multiply the formula above by a factor of (1 + r). So:

P\=PMT×((1+r)n−1)r×(1+r)\\begin{aligned} &\\text{P} = \\text{PMT} \\times \\frac { \\big ( (1 + r) ^ n - 1 \\big ) }{ r } \\times ( 1 + r ) \\\\ \\end{aligned}

If the same example as above were an annuity due, its future value would be calculated as follows:

Future value\=$125,000×((1+0.08)5−1)0.08×(1+0.08)\=$791,991\\begin{aligned} \\text{Future value} &= \\$125,000 \\times \\frac { \\big ( ( 1 + 0.08 ) ^ 5 - 1 \\big ) }{ 0.08 } \\times ( 1 + 0.08 ) \\\\ &= \\$791,991 \\\\ \\end{aligned}

All else being equal, the [[Future Value of an Annuity|future value of an annuity]] due [[Will|will]] be greater than the future value of an [[Ordinary Annuity|ordinary annuity]] because it has had an extra period to accumulate compounded interest. In this example, the future value of the annuity due is $58,666 more than that of the ordinary annuity.
