[[Diversification]]
## What Is [[Diversification]]?

[[Diversification]] is a [[risk management]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp) strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or [[Risk|risk]]. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets [[Will|will]], on average, [[Yield|yield]] higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or [[Security|security]].

## The Basics of [[Diversification]]

[[Diversification]] strives to smooth out [[Unsystematic Risk|unsystematic risk]] events in a [[Portfolio|portfolio]], so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the [[negative performance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-[[Return|return]].asp) of others. The benefits of diversification [[Hold|hold]] only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly [[correlated]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Correlation|correlation]].asp)—that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.

Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified [[Portfolio|portfolio]] of 25 to 30 [[Stocks|stocks]] yields the most cost-effective level of [[Risk|risk]] reduction. The investing in more securities generates further [[Diversification|diversification]] benefits, albeit at a drastically smaller rate.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Diversification]] is a strategy that mixes a [[wide variety]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wide-variety.asp) of investments within a [[Portfolio|portfolio]].
-   [[Portfolio]] [[Holdings|holdings]] can be diversified across asset classes and within classes, and also geographically—by investing in both domestic and foreign markets.
-   [[Diversification]] limits [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Risk|risk]] but can also mitigate performance, at least in the short term.

## [[Diversification]] by Asset Class

Fund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] to allocate to each. Classes can include:

-   [[Stocks]]—[[Shares|shares]] or [[Equity|equity]] in a publicly traded company
-   [[Bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp)—government and corporate fixed-income [[Debt|debt]] instruments
-   Real [[Estate|estate]]—land, buildings, natural resources, agriculture, livestock, and water and mineral deposits
-   Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—a marketable basket of securities that follow an index, commodity, or sector
-   [[Commodities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp)—basic goods necessary for the production of other products or services
-   Cash and short-term cash-equivalents (CCE)—Treasury bills, certificate of deposit (CD), [[Money Market|money market]] vehicles, and other short-term, low-[[Risk|risk]] investments

They [[Will|will]] then diversify among investments within the assets classes, such as by selecting [[Stocks|stocks]] from various sectors that tend to have low [[Return|return]] [[Correlation|correlation]], or by choosing stocks with different [[market capitalizations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp). In the case of bonds, investors can select from investment-grade corporate bonds, U.S. Treasuries, state and municipal bonds, high-[[Yield|yield]] bonds and others. 

## Foreign [[Diversification]]

Investors can reap further [[Diversification|diversification]] benefits by investing in foreign securities because they tend to be less closely correlated with domestic ones. For example, forces depressing the U.S. economy may not affect Japan's economy in the same way. Therefore, holding Japanese [[Stocks|stocks]] gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an American economic downturn.

## [[Diversification]] and the Retail Investor

Time and budget constraints can make it difficult for noninstitutional investors—i.e., individuals—to create an adequately diversified [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. This challenge is a key reason why [[mutual funds]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/introduction-mutual-funds/) are so popular with retail investors. Buying [[Shares|shares]] in a mutual fund offers an inexpensive way to diversify investments.

While mutual funds provide [[Diversification|diversification]] across various asset classes, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) afford investor access to narrow markets such as commodities and international plays that would ordinarily be difficult to access. An individual with a $100,000 [[Portfolio|portfolio]] can spread the investment among ETFs with no overlap.

## Disadvantages of [[Diversification]]

Reduced [[Risk|risk]], a [[Volatility|volatility]] buffer: The pluses of [[Diversification|diversification]] are many. However, there are drawbacks, too. The more [[Holdings|holdings]] a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] has, the more time-consuming it can be to manage—and the more expensive, since buying and selling many different holdings incurs more transaction fees and brokerage commissions. More fundamentally, diversification's spreading-out strategy works both ways, lessening both the risk and the reward.

Say you've invested $120,000 equally among six [[Stocks|stocks]], and one [[Stock|stock]] doubles in value. Your original $20,000 stake is now worth $40,000. You've made a lot, sure, but not as much as if your entire $120,000 had been invested in that one company. By protecting you on the downside, [[Diversification|diversification]] limits you on the [[Upside|upside]]—at least, in the short term. Over the [[Long Term|long term]], diversified portfolios do tend to post higher returns (see example below).

Pros

-   Reduces [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Risk|risk]]
    
-   Hedges against market [[Volatility|volatility]]
    
-   Offers higher returns long-term
    

Cons

-   Limits gains short-term
    
-   Time-consuming to manage
    
-   Incurs more transaction fees, commissions
    

## [[Diversification]] and [[Smart Beta]]

[Smart beta strategies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-beta.asp) [[Offer|offer]] [[Diversification|diversification]] by tracking [[Underlying|underlying]] indices but do not necessarily weigh [[Stocks|stocks]] according to their market cap. ETF managers further screen [[Equity|equity]] issues on [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]] and rebalance portfolios according to objective analysis and not just company size. While [[Smart Beta|smart beta]] portfolios are unmanaged, the primary goal becomes outperformance of the index itself.

For example, as of March 2019, the iShares Edge [[MSCI]] USA Quality Factor ETF holds 125 large- and mid-cap U.S. [[Stocks|stocks]]. By focusing on [[Return|return]] on [[Equity|equity]] (ROE), [[Debt|debt]]-to-equity (D/E) ratio, and not solely market cap, the ETF has returned 90.49% cumulatively since its inception in July 2013. A similar investment in the [[S&P 500 Index]] grew by 66.33%.

## Real World Example

Say an [[aggressive investor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggressiveinvestmentstrategy.asp) who can assume a higher level of [[Risk|risk]], wishes to construct a [[Portfolio|portfolio]] composed of Japanese equities, Australian bonds, and cotton [[Futures|futures]]. He can purchase stakes in the iShares [[MSCI]] [[Japan ETF]], the Vanguard Australian Government Bond Index ETF, and the iPath Bloomberg Cotton Subindex Total [[Return]] ETN, for example.

With this mix of ETF [[Shares|shares]], due to the specific qualities of the targeted asset classes and the transparency of the [[Holdings|holdings]], the investor ensures true [[Diversification|diversification]] in their holdings. Also, with different correlations, or responses to outside forces, among the securities, they can slightly lessen their [[Risk|risk]] exposure.
