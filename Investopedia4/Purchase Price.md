[[Purchase Price]]
## What Is the [[Purchase Price]]?

The [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] is the price an investor pays for an investment, and the price becomes the investor’s [[cost basis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp) for calculating [[Gain|gain]] or loss when selling the investment. The purchase price includes any [[commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Commission|commission]].asp) or sales charges paid for the investment, and the [[Weighted|weighted]] average cost is used for multiple purchases of the same [[Security|security]].

## Understanding [[Purchase Price]]

Assume, for example, an investor buys 100 [[Shares|shares]] of Ford [[Common Stock|common stock]] on three different dates over a five-year period, including 100 shares purchased at a market price of $40, $60 and $80 per share. To determine the cost basis of the purchases, the investor needs to calculate the [[Weighted|weighted]] average cost, which is the total dollar amount of the purchases divided by the number of shares purchased.

At 100 [[Shares|shares]] each, the dollar amounts of Ford [[Stock|stock]] purchases are $4,000, $6,000, and $8,000, or a total of $18,000, and the purchase total is divided by 300 shares to equal $60 per share. If the investor adds to the stock position, they can calculate a new [[Weighted|weighted]] average price by adding the dollar amount of the new purchases and the additional shares to the calculation.

The formula can also be adjusted for [[Stock|stock]] sales if the investor only sells a portion of the [[Holdings|holdings]]. With [[Commission|commission]] costs added, the investor’s [[Weighted|weighted]] average cost might approximate $62 per share.

## The Differences Between Realized and Unrealized Gains

Investors use the [[Purchase Price|purchase price]] of an investment to calculate [[realized gains]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realizedprofit.asp) or losses for tax purposes, and they report that activity on [[Schedule D]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scheduled.asp) of IRS form 1040. An investor reports a [[Realized Gain|realized gain]] if they sell some or all of their investment [[Holdings|holdings]]. If they sell no securities, the investor has an [[Unrealized Gain|unrealized gain]] or loss, which is not reported for tax purposes.

Assume, for example, an investor sells 100 [[Shares|shares]] of Ford [[Stock|stock]] at a sale price of $80 per share and uses the [[Weighted|weighted]] average cost of $62 to calculate a [[Realized Gain|realized gain]] of $18 per share. The investor reports the number of shares, along with the weighted average cost and the sale price per share, on Schedule D. The total realized [[Gain|gain]] of $1,800 is [[Long Term|long term]] because the investor held the shares for over one year. The $1,800 long-term capital gain is offset by any capital losses, and the net gain is taxable using [[capital gains tax]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) rates.
