[[Laggard Definition]]
## What Is a Laggard?

A laggard is a [[Stock|stock]] or [[Security|security]] that is underperforming relative to its benchmark or peers. A laggard [[Will|will]] have lower-than-average returns compared to the market. A laggard is the opposite of a leader.

### Key Takeaways

-   A laggard underperforms its benchmark, in terms of an investment's returns.
-   If an investor holds laggards in their [[Portfolio|portfolio]], these are generally the first candidates for selling.
-   Investors may mistake a laggard for a bargain, but these [[Will|will]] carry excess [[Risk|risk]].

## Understanding Laggards

In most cases, a laggard refers to a [[Stock|stock]]. The term can also, however, describe a company or individual that has been underperforming. It is often used to describe good vs. bad, as in "leaders vs. laggards." Investors want to avoid laggards, because they achieve less-than-desired [[rates of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp). In broader terms, the term _laggard_ connotes resistance to progress and a persistent pattern of falling behind. As an example of a laggard, consider stock ABC that consistently posts annual returns of only 2 percent when other [[Stocks|stocks]] in the industry post average returns of 5 percent. Stock ABC would be considered a laggard.

If an investor's [[Portfolio|portfolio]] contains laggards, these are most likely to be sold off first. Holding a [stock](http://www.investinganswers.com/node/5150) that returns 2 percent instead of one that returns 5 percent costs you 3 percent each year. Unless there is some solid reason to believe that a catalyst [[Will|will]] lift [[Shares|shares]] of a [[Stock|stock]] that has historically lagged its competition, continuing to [[Hold|hold]] the laggard costs money. The reason for a laggard's subpar performance is usually specific to the company. Maybe they lost a big contract. Maybe they are currently dealing with management or labor issues. Maybe their earnings are eroding in an increasingly competitive environment, and they haven't found a way to counteract the trend.

## Risks of Buying Laggard [[Stocks]]

How does a [[Stock|stock]] become a laggard? Perhaps the company continually misses earnings or sales estimates or shows shaky [[Fundamentals|fundamentals]]. Lower-priced [[Stocks|stocks]] also carry more [[Risk|risk]] because they often feature less dollar-based trading [[Liquidity|liquidity]] and exhibit bigger spreads between the bid and ask prices.

Everybody loves a bargain. But when it comes to investing, a cheap or laggard [[Stock|stock]] may not be the best deal. You could very well end up getting what you paid for. While a stock share at $2, $5 or $10 may seem like it has lots of [[Upside|upside]], most [[Stocks|stocks]] selling for $10 or less are cheap for a reason. They have had some sort of deficiency in the past, or they have something wrong with them now.

A better strategy may be to to buy fewer [[Shares|shares]] of an institutional-quality [[Stock|stock]] that’s rising soundly, rather than thousands of shares of a cheap stock. Top mutual funds and other big players prefer companies with sound earnings and sales track records, and share prices of at least $15 on the [[Nasdaq]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/[[Nasdaq|nasdaq]].asp) and $20 on the [[NYSE]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp). They also prefer volumes to be at least 400,000 shares a day, which allows funds to make trades with less impact on the share price.
