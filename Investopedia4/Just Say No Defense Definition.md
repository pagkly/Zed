"Just Say No" Defense Definition
## What Is a "Just Say No" Defense?

A "just say no" defense is a strategy employed by [[boards of directors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp) to discourage [[hostile takeovers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hostiletakeover.asp) by simply refusing to negotiate and rejecting outright whatever the prospective buyer might [[Offer|offer]].

The legality of a “just say no” defense may depend on whether the target company has a long-term strategy it is pursuing, which can include a merger with a firm other than the one making the takeover bid, or if the takeover bid undervalues the company.

### Key Takeaways

-   A "just say no" defense is a strategy used by boards of directors to discourage hostile takeovers by rejecting outright the takeover bid.
-   Named after Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" anti-drug campaign, this strategy gives the board power to decide whether to accept an acquisition proposal or not.
-   Such a stance may be taken to render a takeover impossible or to encourage better offers either from the same bidder or, better yet, from a friendly white knight.
-   The legality of a "just say no" defense may depend on whether the target company has a long-term strategy or if the takeover bid undervalues the company.

## Understanding a "Just Say No" Defense

The origins of the "just say no" defense can be traced to the 1980s. Back then, [[raiders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/raider.asp) with deep pockets became famous for buying undervalued companies and then dismembering them to squeeze out a quick [[profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp), prompting defenseless corporate America to come up with strategies to thwart their advances.

Named after former First Lady Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign, the "just say no" defense left it up to the board to decide whether to accept or reject a bid, regardless of how much was being offered. Reasons could include anything from fear of job [[Security|security]] to a general dislike of the [[acquirer]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquirer.asp).

An early use of the term occurred in 1990 when NCR Corp. rejected AT&T's initial $6.08 billion $90-a-share tender [[Offer|offer]], claiming that it intended to "just say no" to the telephone giant.

The target company's board could deal with an unwanted bid by refusing to negotiate and waive potential defense strategies such as a [[poison pill]](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/poison-pill/). This stance may be taken to render a takeover impossible. Alternatively, it might be pursued to extract a better [[Offer|offer]], either from the same bidder or, better yet, from a friendly [[white knight]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/whiteknight.asp). 

## Example of a "Just Say No" Defense

The case of Paramount Communications vs. Time helped establish the "just say no" defense as a viable [anti-takeover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anti-takeovermeasure.asp) strategy. Time was close to [[merging]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger.asp) with Warner Communications, but then received a bid from Paramount that its board rejected because the publishing company had already negotiated a long-term plan with Warner.

In July 1989, the case was heard in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, DE. In two previous cases, the Delaware courts had established precedents for corporate board actions during [[mergers and acquisitions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) (M&A). In the 1986 Revlon case, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that if the board decides to sell a company, it must accept the highest bid and not show any favoritism. Meanwhile, in a 1985 case involving Unocal, the court ruled that directors defending their company from a raider may respond only in a reasonable way.

Fortunately for Time, the judge supported its board as the corporation's fiduciaries in this matter, even if [[shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) might well have preferred to accept Paramount's bid, adding that corporate law does not compel directors to follow the wishes of the majority of the [[Shares|shares]]. To support his decision for the Time-Warner merger, [he wrote](http://fortune.com/2012/11/21/the-inside-story-of-time-warner/): "Directors, not shareholders, are charged with the duty to manage the firm." On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the decision unanimously.

## Criticism of a “Just Say No” Defense

A "just say no" defense isn't necessarily in the best interest of shareholders since board members can employ it even if an [[Offer|offer]] is made at a significant [premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-a-[[Premium|premium]].asp) to the current share price.

Adding to this frustration is a number of stories of companies using this tactic to [[Hold|hold]] firm and rebuff offers that, in retrospect, they would have better off accepting. One example is Yahoo, which engaged in a "just say no" battle to fight off a $44.6 billion bid from Microsoft ([MSFT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=msft)) in 2008 and then ended up selling off its core business several years later for $4.8 billion.

## Special Considerations

There is a significant [[Risk|risk]] that a "just say no" defense won't be accepted by the courts. If the price offered looks fair and shareholders support it, the board's option to "just say no" may not be viable.

Still, that doesn't mean that directors won't give it a go. Yes, failure is possible. But so, too, is the prospect of securing the company's freedom or, failing that, at least squeezing out a better price for the business.
