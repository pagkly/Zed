[[What Is a Recourse Loan]]?
## [[What Is a Recourse Loan]]?

The term recourse [[Loan|loan]] refers to a type of [[loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp) that can help a [[Lender|lender]] recoup its investment if a borrower fails to pay and the value of the [[underlying asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-asset.asp) is not enough to cover it. A recourse loan is a form of secured financing. It lets the lender go after the [[Debtor|debtor]]'s other assets that were not used as loan [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp) or to take legal action in case of [[Default|default]] in order to pay off the full [[Debt|debt]].

### Key Takeaways

-   A recourse [[Loan|loan]] allows the [[Lender|lender]] to seize the [[Collateral|collateral]] and any other assets the borrower has if they [[Default|default]].
-   Assets that a [[Lender|lender]] may seize for a recourse [[Loan|loan]] include deposit accounts and income sources.
-   Resource [[Loan|loan]] contracts generally outline which assets the [[Lender|lender]] may pursue.
-   Most hard money loans are recourse loans.
-   Lenders prefer recourse loans while borrowers prefer non-recourse loans—loans that only allow the seizure of the [[Collateral|collateral]].

## Understanding Recourse Loans

Borrowers have several options available to them when they need [[financing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp). One type of [[Loan|loan]] is a secured facility. This kind of [[Debt|debt]] requires [[Collateral|collateral]]—an [[asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) that a borrower puts down as [[Security|security]]. The [[Lender|lender]] is able to seize this asset and sell it to satisfy the debt in case the borrower [[defaults]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp).

A recourse [[Loan|loan]] is a type of secured [[Debt|debt]] commonly found in some [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/real-[[Estate|estate]]-investing-guide/) and automobile loans. They give lenders a higher degree of power because they have fewer limits on what assets lenders can go after for loan [[repayment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp). In fact, a recourse loan allows the [[Lender|lender]] to seize the [[Collateral|collateral]] as well as any other assets of the [[Debtor|debtor]]. The lender may also take legal action against the borrower as well.

A recourse [[Loan|loan]] may be easier for borrowers to obtain, but it also puts more of their assets at [[Risk|risk]] in the event of a [[Default|default]].

The [[Lender|lender]] can seize money from the borrower’s savings, checking, or other financial [[accounts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/account.asp). They also [[Grant|grant]] the lender the right to tap into certain [[income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp) sources of the borrower. This can include garnishing their wages. [[Garnishment]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/[[Garnishment|garnishment]].asp) is a legal procedure in which a lender obtains a court order requiring the person's employer to withhold a portion of their earnings in order to pay the [[Debt|debt]]. These earnings can include wages, [[commissions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Commission|commission]].asp), [[bonuses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bonus.asp), and even income from a pension or retirement program.

The contract and terms of a recourse [[Loan|loan]] generally outline the types of assets that a [[Lender|lender]] can go after if a [[Debtor|debtor]] fails to live up to their financial [[obligations]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp). For instance, a full recourse loan allows the lender to go after any and all assets. In limited recourse loans, the lender can only pursue assets that are named specifically in the contract.

## Types of Recourse Loans

Certain types of financing can be classified as recourse loans. For example, [[hard money loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard_money_loan.asp) for [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp) [[acquisitions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp) would be considered recourse loans. The terms of a hard money [[Loan|loan]] give lenders the opportunity to take possession of the property in the event of [[Default|default]] and then resell it themselves. Lenders may even agree to provide this financing with the hope of taking ownership of the property because they believe they can resell it for a greater [[Gain|gain]].

## Recourse [[Loan]] vs. Non-Recourse Loan

[Non-recourse loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonrecoursedebt.asp) are also secured forms of financing but they are inherently different from recourse loans. If a borrower defaults, the [[Lender|lender]] is only allowed to seize the [[Collateral|collateral]] used to secure the [[Loan|loan]] and nothing else. This means any balance that remains after the [[Security|security]] is sold must be written off. Many traditional mortgages are non-recourse loans, using only the home itself as collateral. So, if the homeowner defaults, the lender may seize the home but not any other assets belonging to the borrower.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Recourse Loans

Lenders that [[Offer|offer]] hard money loans may approve borrowers that other [[financial institutions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp) would reject. For that reason, borrowers with a limited or poor [[credit history]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp) might turn to this type of [[Loan|loan]]. The leniency regarding approvals comes with a caveat for borrowers. The [[Lender|lender]] could go after the [[Debtor|debtor]]'s other assets in the event of a [[Default|default]]. Note, though, that there can be limits on the types of assets the lender may attach to the loan—a good reason to read any contract carefully.

From the [[Lender|lender]]'s point of view, a recourse [[Loan|loan]] reduces the perceived [[risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]].asp) associated with less creditworthy borrowers. The potential for the lender to seize property beyond the initial [[Collateral|collateral]] can quell some concerns that the borrower [[Will|will]] not make good on the [[Debt|debt]]. But recourse loans such as hard money loans are often more expensive for the borrower than traditional financing provided by banks at the going rate. This is why lenders typically prefer issuing recourse loans, while borrowers prefer non-recourse loans.

## Example of a Recourse [[Loan]]

Here's a hypothetical example of a recourse [[Loan|loan]]. Suppose a homeowner takes out a recourse loan for $500,000 to purchase a home and then goes into [[foreclosure]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp) after the local housing market declines. If the value of the home is now down to $400,000 and it was purchased with a recourse loan, the lending institution can go after the borrower's other assets in order to make up the outstanding $100,000 and pay off the loan to close it.
