[[Voluntary Lien]]
## What Is a [[Voluntary Lien]]?

A [[Voluntary Lien|voluntary lien]] is a claim that one person has over the property of another as [[Security|security]] for the payment of a [[Debt|debt]]. Liens are attached to the property and not to a person. A voluntary [[lien]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lien|lien]].asp) is contractual or consensual, meaning that the lien is created by an action taken by the [[Debtor|debtor]], such as a mortgage [[Loan|loan]] to buy real [[Estate|estate]].

## Understanding [[Voluntary Lien]]

A [[Voluntary Lien|voluntary lien]] is a type of [[Lien|lien]] that exists because of an action taken by a [[debtor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/[[Debtor|debtor]].asp). This is the opposite of an involuntary lien that occurs by law, such as a tax or special assessment lien that is imposed by a regulatory authority. Naturally the holder of property cannot legally sell the property while a lien is in place. The lien should reflect the real value of the property in question that is being used as [[Collateral|collateral]]. Should there be a [[Default|default]] on the [[Debt|debt]], the lien holder can take possession of the property—for example, through foreclosure proceedings in real [[Estate|estate]] or through a repossession of vehicles.

## Different Ways Voluntary Liens Are Applied

In addition, [mortgages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) for real [[Estate|estate]], voluntary liens come into play with financing for other transactions, such as loans for cars. Oftentimes the physical property acts as [[Collateral|collateral]] under the [[Lien|lien]]; however, there are examples where a [[Voluntary Lien|voluntary lien]] is applied to business loans, personal loans with collateral other than cars or homes, credit agreements, and even rent-to-own appliances.

The nature of the [[Lien|lien]] might be structured to be placed on something other than property that is procured through the [[Loan|loan]] that was taken out. Instead, some sort of property that is already owned is put as [[Collateral|collateral]] for a line of credit or cash advance that [[Will|will]] be used for other purposes.

For instance, a [[Lien|lien]] could be put on a valuable painting that is put up as [[Collateral|collateral]] for a cash advance to fund another purchase. A homeowner who has already paid off a mortgage might need more cash-in-hand and seek a [[Home Equity|home equity]] line of credit. Just as with a mortgage, the house would serve as collateral with the lien holder getting an interest. Moreover, a business could have a [[Voluntary Lien|voluntary lien]] on it if the business owner takes out a line of credit to cover various operational costs and projects. In this case, they would not take possession of the business. Instead, they would receive a [[Security|security]] interest in it.
