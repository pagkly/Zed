[[Nostro Account]]
## What Is a [[Nostro Account]]?

A [[Nostro Account|nostro account]] refers to an account that a bank holds in a foreign currency in another bank. Nostros, a term derived from the Latin word for "ours," are frequently used to facilitate [[foreign exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp) and trade transactions. The opposite term "[vostro accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vostroaccount.asp)," derived from the Latin word for "yours," is how a bank refers to the accounts that other banks have on its books in its home currency.

## How a [[Nostro Account]] Works

A [[Nostro Account|nostro account]] and a [[Vostro Account|vostro account]] actually refer to the same entity but from a different perspective. For example, Bank X has an account with Bank [[Y]] in Bank Y's home currency. To Bank X, that is a nostro, meaning "our account on your books," while to Bank Y, it is a vostro, meaning "your account on our books." These accounts are used to facilitate international [[transactions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction.asp) and to settle transactions that [[Hedge|hedge]] [[exchange rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp) [[Risk|risk]].

### Key Takeaways

-   Nostro accounts simplify the process of exchanging and trading in foreign currencies.
-   Major examples of convertible currencies are the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, the [[euro]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp), and the Japanese yen.
-   The bank that is holding a nostro or [[Vostro Account|vostro account]] may be called the "facilitator" bank.
-   Nostro accountsÂ are not the same as standard demand deposit accounts because these types of accounts are denominated in foreign currencies.

Prior to the advent of the euro as a currency for financial settlements on Jan. 1, 1999, banks needed to [[Hold|hold]] nostro accounts in all the countries that now use the euro. Since that date, one nostro for the entire [[Eurozone|eurozone]] has been sufficient. If a country were to leave the eurozone, either voluntarily or involuntarily, banks would need to re-establish nostros in that country in its new currency in order to continue making payments.

## Example of a Payment Using a [[Nostro Account]]

The following example illustrates the process of making a payment using a [[Nostro Account|nostro account]]. Bank A in the United States enters into a spot foreign exchange contract to buy British pounds from Bank B, which is in Sweden. On the [[settlement date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlementdate.asp), Bank B must deliver pounds from its nostro account in the United Kingdom to the nostro account of Bank A, also in the United Kingdom. On the same day, Bank A must pay dollars in the United States to the nostro account of Bank B.

## Special Considerations

The [[central banks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) of many developing countries limit the buying and selling of their currencies, which is usually to control imports and exports and to control the exchange rate. Banks generally do not [[Hold|hold]] nostro accounts in those countries, as there is little or no foreign exchange business. When a bank needs to make a payment in a country where it does not hold a [[Nostro Account|nostro account]], it can use a bank with which it has a correspondent relationship to make the payment on its behalf.
