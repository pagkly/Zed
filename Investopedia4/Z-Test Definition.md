[[Z-Test Definition]]
## What Is a [[Z]]-Test?

A [[Z|z]]-test is a statistical test used to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and the sample size is large. The test statistic is assumed to have a [[normal distribution]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp), and nuisance parameters such as [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] should be known in order for an accurate z-test to be performed.

A [[Z|z]]-statistic, or z-score, is a number representing how many standard deviations above or below the mean population a score derived from a z-test is.

### Key Takeaways

-   _A [[Z|z]]-test is a statistical test to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and the sample size is large._
-   _It can be used to test hypotheses in which the [[Z|z]]-test follows a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]._
-   _A [[Z|z]]-statistic, or z-score, is a number representing the result from the z-test._
-   _Z-tests are closely related to t-tests, but t-tests are best performed when an experiment has a small sample size._
-   _Also, t-tests assume the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] is unknown, while [[Z|z]]-tests assume it is known._

## How [[Z]]-Tests Work

Examples of tests that can be conducted as [[Z|z]]-tests include a one-sample location test, a two-sample location test, a paired difference test, and a maximum likelihood estimate. Z-tests are closely related to t-tests, but t-tests are best performed when an experiment has a small sample size. Also, t-tests assume the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] is unknown, while z-tests assume it is known. If the standard deviation of the population is unknown, the assumption of the sample variance equaling the population variance is made.

## Hypothesis Test

The [[Z|z]]-test is also a hypothesis test in which the z-statistic follows a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]. The z-test is best used for greater-than-30 samples because, under the central limit theorem, as the number of samples gets larger, the samples are considered to be approximately normally distributed. When conducting a z-test, the null and alternative hypotheses, alpha and [[z-score]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zscore.asp) should be stated. Next, the test statistic should be calculated, and the results and conclusion stated.

## One-Sample [[Z]]-Test Example

Assume an investor wishes to test whether the average daily [[Return|return]] of a [[Stock|stock]] is greater than 1%. A simple random sample of 50 returns is calculated and has an average of 2%. Assume the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the returns is 2.5%. Therefore, the null hypothesis is when the average, or mean, is equal to 3%.

Conversely, the alternative hypothesis is whether the mean [[Return|return]] is greater or less than 3%. Assume an alpha of 0.05% is selected with a [[two-tailed test]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two-tailed-test.asp). Consequently, there is 0.025% of the samples in each tail, and the alpha has a critical value of 1.96 or -1.96. If the value of [[Z|z]] is greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96, the null hypothesis is rejected.

The value for [[Z|z]] is calculated by subtracting the value of the average daily [[Return|return]] selected for the test, or 1% in this case, from the observed average of the samples. Next, divide the resulting value by the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] divided by the square root of the number of observed values. Therefore, the test statistic is calculated to be 2.83, or (0.02 - 0.01) / (0.025 / (50)^(1/2)). The investor rejects the null hypothesis since z is greater than 1.96 and concludes that the average daily return is greater than 1%.
