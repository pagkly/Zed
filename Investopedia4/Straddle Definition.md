[[Straddle Definition]]
## What Is a Straddle?

A straddle is a [[Neutral|neutral]] options strategy that involves simultaneously buying both a [[put]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) option and a [[call]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call.asp) option for the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] with the same [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) and the same [[expiration date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expiration-date.asp).

A trader [[Will|will]] profit from a long straddle when the price of the [[Security|security]] rises or falls from the strike price by an amount more than the total cost of the [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp) paid. Profit potential is virtually unlimited, so long as the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] security moves very sharply.

### Key Takeaways

-   A straddle is an options strategy involving the purchase of both a put and call option for the same expiration date and strike price on the same [[Underlying|underlying]].
-   The strategy is profitable only when the [[Stock|stock]] either rises or falls from the strike price by more than the total [[Premium|premium]] paid.
-   A straddle implies what the expected [[Volatility|volatility]] and trading range of a [[Security|security]] may be by the expiration date.

## Understanding Straddles

More broadly, straddle strategies in [[Finance|finance]] refer to two separate transactions which both involve the same [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]], with the two component transactions offsetting one another. Investors tend to employ a straddle when they anticipate a significant move in a [[Stock|stock]]'s price but are unsure about whether the price [[Will|will]] move up or down.

A straddle can give a trader two significant clues about what the options market thinks about a [[Stock|stock]]. First is the [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) the market is expecting from the [[Security|security]]. Second is the expected trading range of the stock by the expiration date.

## Putting Together a Straddle

To determine the cost of creating a straddle one must add the price of the put and the call together. For example, if a trader believes that a [[Stock|stock]] may rise or fall from its current price of $55 following earnings on March 1, they could create a straddle. The trader would look to purchase one put and one call at the $55 strike with an expiration date of March 15. To determine the cost of creating the straddle, the trader would add the price of one March 15 $55 call and one March 15 $55 put. If both the calls and the puts trade for $2.50 each, the total outlay or [[Premium|premium]] paid would be $5.00 for the two contracts.

The [[Premium|premium]] paid suggests that the [[Stock|stock]] would need to rise or fall by 9% from the $55 strike price to earn a profit by March 15. The amount the stock is expected to rise-or-fall is a measure of the future expected [[Volatility|volatility]] of the stock. To determine how much the stock needs to rise or fall, divide the premium paid by the strike price, which is $5 / $55, or 9%.

## Discovering the Predicted Trading Range

Option prices imply a predicted trading range. To determine the expected trading range of a [[Stock|stock]], one could add or subtract the price of the straddle to or from the price of the stock. In this case, the $5 [[Premium|premium]] could be added to $55 to predict a trading range of $50 to $60. If the stock traded within the zone of $50 to $60, the trader would lose some of their money but not necessarily all of it. At the time of expiration, it is only possible to earn a profit if the stock rises or falls outside of the $50 to $60 zone.

## Earning a Profit

If the [[Stock|stock]] fell to $48, the calls would be worth $0, while the puts would be worth $7 at expiration. That would deliver a profit of $2 to the trader. However, if the stock went to $57, the calls would be worth $2, and the puts would be worth zero, giving the trader a loss of $3. The worst-case scenario is when the stock price stays at or near the strike price.

## Real World Example

On Oct. 18, 2018, the options market was implying that AMD’s [[Stock|stock]] could rise or fall 20% from the $26 strike price for expiration on Nov. 16, because it cost $5.10 to buy one put and call. It placed the stock in a trading range of $20.90 to $31.15. A week later, the company reported results and [[Shares|shares]] plunged from $22.70 to $19.27 on Oct. 25.1 In this case, the trader would have earned a profit because the stock fell outside of the range, exceeding the [[Premium|premium]] cost of buying the puts and calls.
