[[Swingline Loan Definition]]
## What is a Swingline [[Loan]]?

A swingline [[Loan|loan]] is a short-term loan made by financial institutions that provides businesses with access to funds to cover [[Debt|debt]] commitments. A swingline loan can be a sub-limit of an existing credit facility or a [[syndicated]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/syndicatedloan.asp) credit line, which is financing offered by a group of lenders. Swingline loans typically have short operating durations that can range from five to 15 days on average.

Swingline loans are helpful to companies since they provide much-needed cash relatively quickly. However, swingline loans often carry higher interest rates than traditional lines of credit, and the funds are limited to covering [[Debt|debt]] obligations.

## How a Swingline [[Loan]] Works

Financial institutions make swingline loans to both businesses and individuals. A swingline [[Loan|loan]] for individuals is similar to a [[payday loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payday-loans.asp), providing cash quickly. However, fast access to credit comes at a cost in the form of a significantly higher interest rate than other forms of credit, such as bank-issued personal loans.

Companies can use swingline loans to cover temporary shortfalls in [[Cash Flow|cash flow]], and in that sense, they are similar to other lines of credit in how they function. However, the funds provided by this type of [[Loan|loan]] are meant to be used only for paying down existing debts. In other words, the funds can not be used for expanding the business, acquiring new assets, or investments in research and development.

The limitation of the use of funds differentiates swingline loans from traditional lines of credit, which can be used for almost any purpose such as buying goods and [[Debt|debt]] repayments.

Swingline loans can be tapped or drawn down on the same day a request is made to the [[Lender|lender]] and be issued for smaller amounts than the existing credit facility.

A swingline [[Loan|loan]] can take the form of [[revolving credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revolvingcredit.asp), which is a line of credit that the borrower can draw on, and payback, repeatedly. Though the loan normally has an upward limit, as long as the funds are paid back as agreed, they can be withdrawn as needed on very short notice. Often, borrowers can receive funds on the same day they request them, and the cycle of repayment and withdrawal can continue as long as all the conditions of borrowing are met and both parties choose to keep the line open.

[[Revolving Credit|Revolving credit]] lines, including swingline loans, can be closed at the discretion of either the borrower or the [[Lender|lender]]. Lenders have the option to close any line of credit that they consider to be too risky. Swingline loans are best suited for use in cases where normal processing delays make other forms of loans impractical.
