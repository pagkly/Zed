[[Price Controls]]
## What Are [[Price Controls]]?

[[Price Controls|Price controls]] are government-mandated legal minimum or maximum prices set for specified goods. They are usually implemented as a means of direct economic intervention to manage the affordability of certain goods.

## Understanding [[Price Controls]]

Governments most commonly implement [[Price Controls|price controls]] on staples—essential items, such as food or energy products. Price controls that set maximum prices are [[price ceilings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-ceiling.asp), while price controls that set minimum prices are price floors.

### Key Takeaways

-   [[Price Controls|Price controls]] are government-mandated minimum or maximum prices set for specific goods and are typically put in place to manage the affordability of the goods.
-   At best, [[Price Controls|price controls]] are only effective on an extremely short-term basis.
-   Over the [[Long Term|long term]], [[Price Controls|price controls]] can lead to problems such as shortages, [[Rationing|rationing]], inferior product quality, and black markets.

Over the [[Long Term|long term]], [[Price Controls|price controls]] inevitably lead to problems such as [[shortages]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortage.asp), [[rationing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Rationing|rationing]].asp), deterioration of product quality, and [[black markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackmarket.asp) that arise to [[Supply|supply]] the price-controlled goods through unofficial channels.

Examples in the United States are the [[Price Controls|price controls]] set on gasoline during the Nixon administration, which eventually led to major shortages in [[Supply|supply]] and long, slow lines at gas pumps.

## Example of [[Price Controls]]

Rent control is another frequently cited example of the ineffectiveness of [[Price Controls|price controls]]. Rent-control policies widely implemented in New York City were intended to help maintain an adequate [[Supply|supply]] of affordable housing. However, the actual effect has been to reduce the overall supply of available rental space, which in turn has contributed (among other factors) to even higher prices in the market of available rental housing.

Some economists argue that the net effect of [[rent control]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rent-control.asp) has been to discourage real [[Estate|estate]] [[Entrepreneurs|entrepreneurs]] from becoming landlords. This has created a [[Supply|supply]] situation in which there is less rental housing available than the amount that would have been created by a [[free market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp), thereby putting continued upward pressure on rental rates.

Controlled rental rates, it is argued, has also discouraged landlords from making the necessary expenditures to maintain or improve rental properties, leading to deterioration in the quality of rental housing.

Some economists believe that [[Price Controls|price controls]]—based on a reading of the use of such measures—have shown that, at best, they are effective only on an extremely short-term basis.

## Criticism of [[Price Controls]]

As a government measure, [[Price Controls|price controls]] may be enacted with the best of intentions, but in actual practice, they often don't work. Most attempts to control prices often struggle to overcome the economic forces of [[Supply|supply]] and demand for any significant length of time.

When prices are established by [[Commerce|commerce]] in a free market, prices shift to maintain the balance between [[Supply|supply]] and demand. However, when a government imposes [[Price Controls|price controls]], the eventual consequence can be the creation of excess demand in the case of price ceilings, or excess supply in the case of price floors.

Again, the gasoline [[Price Controls|price controls]] of the 1970s provide a classic example. No government attempting to cap the price of gasoline could change the fact that gasoline producers were only willing to sell an extremely limited [[Supply|supply]] of gasoline for the price set by the government. This resulted in extreme shortages in gasoline.
