[[Open-End Mortgage Definition]]
## What Is an Open-End Mortgage?

An open-end mortgage is a type of [[mortgage]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) that allows the borrower to increase the amount of the mortgage [[Principal|principal]] outstanding at a later time. Open-end mortgages permit the borrower to go back to the [[lender]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/[[Lender|lender]].asp) and borrow more money. There is usually a set dollar limit on the additional amount that can be borrowed.

### Key Takeaways

-   An open-end mortgage is a type of mortgage that allows the borrower to increase the amount of the mortgage [[Principal|principal]] outstanding at a later time.
-   An open-end mortgage allows a borrower to take a portion of the [[Loan|loan]] value for which they have been approved to cover the costs of their home; by taking only a portion, the borrower can pay a lower interest rate since they are only obligated to make interest payments on the outstanding balance.
-   An open-end mortgage is advantageous for a borrower who qualifies for a higher [[Loan|loan]] [[Principal|principal]] amount than may be needed to buy the home.

## How an Open-End Mortgage Works

An open-end mortgage is similar to a delayed draw term [[Loan|loan]]. It also has features similar to [[revolving credit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revolvingcredit.asp). Open-end mortgages are unique in that they are a loan agreement that is secured against a real [[Estate|estate]] property with funds going only toward investment in that property.

The process for application is similar to other credit products, and the terms of the [[Loan|loan]] are determined by a borrower’s [[Credit Score|credit score]] and credit profile. In some cases, co-borrowers may have a higher chance of approval for an open-end mortgage if they present a lower [[default risk]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp).

Open-end mortgages can give a borrower a maximum [[Principal|principal]] amount for which they can obtain over a specified time. The borrower can take a portion of the [[Loan|loan]] value for which they have been approved to cover the costs of their home. Taking only a portion allows the borrower to pay lower interest since they are only obligated to make interest payments on the outstanding balance. In an open-end mortgage, the borrower can receive the loan principal at any time specified in the terms of the [[loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp). The amount available to borrow may also be tied to the value of the home.

An open-end mortgage is different from a delayed draw term [[Loan|loan]] because the borrower usually does not have to meet any specific milestones in order to obtain additional funds. An open-end mortgage differs from [[Revolving Credit|revolving credit]] because the funds are usually available only for a specified time. The terms of revolving credit specify that the funds stay open indefinitely, with the exception being if a borrower defaults.

In an open-end mortgage, the drawdowns from the available credit can also only be used against the [[secured collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp). Therefore, payouts must go toward the real [[Estate|estate]] property for which the [[Lender|lender]] has the title.

## Advantages of an Open-End Mortgage

An open-end mortgage is advantageous for a borrower who qualifies for a higher [[Loan|loan]] [[principal]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Principal|principal]].asp) amount than may be needed to buy the home. An open-end mortgage can provide a borrower with a maximum amount of credit available at a favorable loan rate. The borrower has the advantage of drawing on the loan principal to pay for any property costs that arise during the entire life of the loan.

## Example of an Open-End Mortgage

For example, assume a borrower obtains a $200,000 open-end mortgage to purchase a home. The [[Loan|loan]] has a term of 30 years with a fixed interest rate of 5.75%. They receive rights to the $200,000 [[Principal|principal]] amount but they do not have to take the full amount at once. The borrower may choose to take $100,000, which would require making interest payments at the 5.75% rate on the outstanding balance. Five years later, the borrower may take another $50,000. At that time, the additional $50,000 is added to the outstanding principal and they begin paying 5.75% interest on the total outstanding balance.
