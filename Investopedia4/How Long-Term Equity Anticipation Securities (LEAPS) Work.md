[[How Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) Work]]
## What Are Long-Term [[Equity]] Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)?

Long-term [[Equity|equity]] anticipation securities (LEAPS) are publicly traded [[options contracts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) with [[expiration dates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expiration-date.asp) that are longer than one year, and typically up to three years from issue. They are functionally identical to most other [[Listed|listed]] options, except with longer times until expiration. They were first introduced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1990, and are now ubiquitous.

As with all options contracts, a LEAPS contract grants a buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell (depending on if the option is a call or a put, respectively) the [[underlying asset]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-asset.asp) at the predetermined price on or before its expiration date.

### Key Takeaways

-   Long-term [[Equity|equity]] anticipation securities (LEAPS) are [[Listed|listed]] options contracts that expire in more than a year.
-   These contracts are ideal for options traders looking to trade a prolonged trend.
-   LEAPS can be [[Listed|listed]] on a particular [[Stock|stock]] or an index as a whole.
-   LEAPS are often used in hedging strategies and can be particularly effective for protecting retirement portfolios.

## Understanding Long-Term [[Equity]] Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)

LEAPS are no different from short-term options, except for the later expiration dates. Lengthier times until [[maturity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp) allow long-term investors to [[Gain|gain]] exposure to prolonged price movements.

As with many short-term options contracts, investors pay a [[premium]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Premium|premium]].asp)—upfront fee—for the ability to buy or sell above or below the option's [[strike price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp). The strike is the decided upon price for the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset at which it converts at expiry. For example, a $25 strike price for a GE call option would mean an investor could buy 100 [[Shares|shares]] of GE at $25 at expiry. The investor [[Will|will]] exercise the $25 option if the market price is higher than the strike price. Should it be less, the investor will allow the option to expire and will lose the price paid for the premium. Also, remember each options contract—put or call—equates to 100 shares of the underlying asset.

An investor must understand that they [[Will|will]] be tying funds up in these long-term contracts. Changes in the market [[interest rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) and market or asset [[Volatility|volatility]] may make these options more or less valuable, depending on the holding and the direction of movement.

## Long-Term [[Equity]] Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) Premiums

Premiums are the non-refundable cost associated with an options contract. The premiums for LEAPS are higher than those for standard options in the same [[Stock|stock]] because the further out expiration date gives the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset more time to make a substantial move and for the investor to make a healthy profit. Known as the [[time value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalue.asp), option marketplaces use this lengthy timeframe and the [[intrinsic value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp) of the contract to determine the value of the option.

Intrinsic value is the calculated or estimated value of how likely the option is to make a [[profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp) based on the difference between the asset's market and strike price. This value may include profit that already exists in the contract before purchase. The contract writer [[Will|will]] use [[Fundamental Analysis|fundamental analysis]] of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset or business to help place the intrinsic value.

As mentioned earlier, the option contract has a basis of 100 [[Shares|shares]] of the asset. So, if the [[Premium|premium]] for Facebook ([FB](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/[[Quote|quote]]?tvwidgetsymbol=fb)) is $6.25, the option buyer [[Will|will]] pay $625 total premium ($6.25 x 100 = $625).

Other factors that can affect the [[Premium|premium]] price include the [[volatility]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/[[Volatility|volatility]].asp) of the [[Stock|stock]], the market interest rate, and if the asset returns [[dividends]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp). Finally, throughout the life of the contract, the option [[Will|will]] have a theoretical value derived from the use of various pricing models. This fluctuating price indicates what the holder may receive if they sell their contract to another investor before expiration.

## Long-Term [[Equity]] Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) vs. Shorter-Term Contracts

LEAPS also allow investors to [[Gain|gain]] access to the long-term options market without needing to use a combination of shorter-term option contracts. Short-term options have a maximum expiration date of one year. Without LEAPS, investors who wanted a two-year option would have to buy a one-year option, let it expire, and simultaneously purchase a new one-year options contract.

This process—called rolling contracts over—would expose the investor to market changes in the prices of the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset as well as additional option premiums. LEAPS provide the longer-term [[trader]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) with exposure to a prolonged trend in a particular [[Security|security]] with one trade.

## Long-Term [[Equity]] Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) Calls

[[Equity]]—another name for [[Stocks|stocks]]—LEAPS [[call options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) allow investors to benefit from potential rises in a specific [[Stock|stock]] while using less capital than purchasing [[Shares|shares]] with cash upfront. In other words, the cost of the [[Premium|premium]] for an option is lower than the cash needed to buy 100 shares outright. Similar to short-term call options, LEAPS calls allow investors to [[exercise]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp) their options by purchasing the shares of the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock at the strike price.

Another advantage of LEAPS calls is that they let the holder sell the contract at any time before the expiration. The difference in premiums between the purchase and sale prices can lead to a profit or loss. Also, investors must include any fees or commissions charged by their [[broker]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) to buy or sell the contract.

## Long-Term [[Equity]] Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) Puts

LEAPS puts provide investors with a long-term [[hedge]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/[[Hedge|hedge]].asp) if they own the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]]. [[Put options]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) [[Gain|gain]] in value as an underlying stock's price declines, potentially offsetting the losses incurred for owning [[Shares|shares]] of the stock. In essence, the put can help cushion the blow of falling asset prices.

For example, an investor who owns [[Shares|shares]] of XYZ Inc. and wishes to [[Hold|hold]] them for the [[Long Term|long term]] might be fearful that the [[Stock|stock]] price could fall. To allay these concerns, the investor could purchase LEAPS puts on XYZ to [[Hedge|hedge]] against unfavorable moves in the [[long]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) stock position. LEAPS puts help investors benefit from price declines without the need to [[short sell]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) shares of the [[Underlying|underlying]] stock.

[[Short Selling|Short selling]] involves borrowing [[Shares|shares]] from a broker and selling them with the expectation that the [[Stock|stock]] [[Will|will]] continue to depreciate by expiry. At expiry, the shares are purchased—hopefully at a lower price—and the position is netted out for a [[Gain|gain]] or loss. However, short selling can be extremely risky if the stock price rises instead of falling, leading to significant losses.

## Index Long-Term [[Equity]] Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)

A [[market index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp) is a theoretical [[Portfolio|portfolio]] made up of several [[Underlying|underlying]] assets that represent a [[Market Segment|market segment]], industry, or other groups of securities. There are LEAPS available for [[Equity|equity]] indexes. Similar to the single equity LEAPS, index LEAPS allow investors to [[Hedge|hedge]] and invest in indices such as the [[Standard & Poor's 500 Index]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) (S&P 500).

Index LEAPS give the holder the ability to track the entire [[stock market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp) or specific industry sectors and take a [[bullish]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp) stance using call options or a bearish stance using put options. Investors could also [[Hedge|hedge]] their portfolios against adverse market moves with index LEAPS puts.

## Real World Example of Long-Term [[Equity]] Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)

Let's say an investor holds a [[portfolio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Portfolio|portfolio]].asp) of securities, which primarily includes the S&P 500 constituents. The investor believes there may be a market [[correction]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Correction|correction]].asp) within the next two years and, as a result, purchases index LEAPS puts on the [[S&P 500 Index]] to [[Hedge|hedge]] against adverse moves.

The investor buys a December 2021 LEAPS put option with a strike price of 3,000 for the S&P 500 and pays $300 upfront for the right to sell the index [[Shares|shares]] at 3,000 on the option's expiration date.

If the index falls below 3,000 by expiry, the [[Stock|stock]] [[Holdings|holdings]] in the [[Portfolio|portfolio]] [[Will|will]] likely fall, but the LEAPS put will increase in value, helping to offset the loss in the portfolio. However, if the S&P 500 rises, the LEAPS put option will expire worthless, and the investor would be out the $300 [[Premium|premium]].
