[[Revocable Trust]]
## What Is a [[Revocable Trust]]?

A revocable [[trust]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp) is a trust whereby provisions can be altered or canceled dependent on the [[grantor]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grantor.asp) or the originator of the trust. During the life of the trust, income earned is distributed to the grantor, and only after death does property transfer to the [[beneficiaries of the trust]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary-of-trust.asp).

A [[Revocable Trust|revocable trust]] is helpful since it provides flexibility and income to the living grantor (also called the trustor). Provisions of the trust can be changed, and the [[estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/[[Estate|estate]].asp) [[Will|will]] be transferred to the beneficiaries upon the trustor's death.

### Key Takeaways

-   Trusts are created by individuals assigning a [[Trustee|trustee]] to manage and distribute the assets to the beneficiaries after the owner's death.
-   Revocable trusts let the living grantor change instructions, remove assets, or terminate the trust.
-   Irrevocable trusts cannot be changed; assets placed inside them cannot be removed by anyone for any reason.
-   Revocable trusts allow beneficiaries to avoid [[Probate|probate]] court and guardianship or conservatorship proceedings.
-   However, revocable trusts have upfront costs, involve many steps to fund, and don't exempt the owner from needing a [[Will|will]].

## How a [[Revocable Trust]] Works

A [[revocable trust]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/012916/revocable-trusts-101-how-they-work.asp) is a part of [[estate planning]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp) that manages and protects the assets of the grantor as the owner ages. The trust can be amended or revoked as the grantor desires and is included in [[estate taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estatetax.asp). Depending on the trust’s directions, a [[trustee]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/[[Trustee|trustee]].asp) might be assigned to manage the assets or property within the trust. The trustee is also charged with distributing the assets to the beneficiaries. The trust remains private and [[becomes irrevocable]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071615/what-difference-between-revocable-trust-and-living-trust.asp) upon the grantor’s death.

The money or property held by the [[Trustee|trustee]] for the benefit of someone else is called the [[Principal|principal]] of the trust. The value of the principal can change due to the trustee’s expenses or the investment’s appreciation or depreciation in the financial markets. The collective assets comprise the [[trust fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust-fund.asp). The person or people benefiting from the trust are the beneficiaries. Because a [[Revocable Trust|revocable trust]] lists one or more beneficiaries, the trust avoids [[probate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/[[Probate|probate]].asp), which is the legal process of distributing assets of a [[will]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/[[Will|will]].asp).

All trusts are either revocable–living trusts, that can be changed by the grantor if need be, or irrevocable—fixed trusts that cannot be changed once established.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of a [[Revocable Trust]]

There are several advantages of establishing a [[Revocable Trust|revocable trust]]. If the grantor experiences health concerns through the aging process, a revocable trust allows the grantor’s chosen manager to take control of the [[Principal|principal]]. If the grantor owns [[real estate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp) outside the state of the grantor's [[domicile]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/domicile.asp) and the real [[Estate|estate]] is included in the trust, the ancillary [[Probate|probate]] of the real estate is avoided.

If a beneficiary is not of legal age and cannot [[Hold|hold]] property, the minor’s assets are held in the trust rather than having the court appoint a guardian. If the grantor believes a beneficiary [[Will|will]] not use the assets wisely, the trust allows a set amount of money to be distributed on a regular basis.

There are some disadvantages to revocable trusts. Implementing a [[Revocable Trust|revocable trust]] involves much time and effort. Assets must be retitled in the name of the trust to avoid [[Probate|probate]]. The grantor’s entire [[Estate|estate]] plan [[must be monitored annually]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-[[Finance|finance]]/070815/10-questions-ask-your-estate-planning-attorney.asp) to ensure the trust’s objectives are being met. Costs of maintaining a revocable trust are greater than other [[Estate Planning|estate planning]] tools such as a [[will]](https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-[[Will|will]]-makers-4843732). A revocable trust does not [[Offer|offer]] the grantor tax advantages. Since not all assets will be included in the revocable trust, the grantor must create a [[will]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060915/what-happens-when-will-and-revocable-trust-conflict.asp) to designate beneficiaries for the remaining assets, to avoid probate. During the grantor’s lifetime, [[creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Creditor|creditor]].asp) can still reach the property in a revocable trust.
