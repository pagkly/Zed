# High Ratio [[Loan]] Definition

[[How to Calculate a High-Ratio Loan and What it Means to Investors]]
## What Is a High-Ratio [[Loan]]?

A high ratio [[Loan|loan]] is a loan whereby the loan value is high relative to the property value being used as [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/[[Collateral|collateral]].asp). Mortgage loans that have high loan ratios have a loan value that approaches 100% of the value of the property. A high ratio loan might be approved for a borrower who is unable to put down a large [[down payment.]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down_payment.asp)

For mortgages, a high ratio [[Loan|loan]] usually means the loan value exceeds 80% of the property's value. The calculation is called the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which is an [assessment of lending risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/[[Risk|risk]]-assessment.asp) that financial institutions use before approving a mortgage.

### Key Takeaways

-   A high-ratio [[Loan|loan]] is a loan whereby the loan value is high relative to the property value being used as [[Collateral|collateral]].
-   Mortgage loans that have high [[Loan|loan]] ratios have a loan value that approaches 100% of the value of the property.
-   A high-ratio [[Loan|loan]] usually means the loan value exceeds 80% of the property's value. The calculation is called the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.

## The Formula for a High-Ratio [[Loan]] using LTV

Although there's no specific formula to calculate a high ratio [[Loan|loan]], investors should first calculate the [[loan-to-value ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp) in their situation to determine if the loan exceeds the 80% LTV threshold.

[[Loan]] to Value Ratio\=Mortgage amountAppraised property value\\text{Loan to Value Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Mortgage amount}}{\\text{Appraised property value}}

## How to Calculate a High-Ratio [[Loan]] Using LTV

1.  The LTV ratio is calculated by dividing the amount borrowed by the [appraised](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp) value of the property.
2.  Multiply the result by 100 to express it as a percentage. 
3.  If the value of the [[Loan|loan]] after your downpayment exceeds 80% of the LTV, the loan is considered a high ratio loan.

## What Does a High Ratio [[Loan]] Tell You?

Lenders and financial providers use the LTV ratio to measure the level of [[Risk|risk]] associated with making a mortgage [[Loan|loan]]. If a borrower can't make a sizable downpayment and as a result, the loan value approaches the value of the appraised value of the property, it'll be considered a high ratio loan. In other words, as the loan value gets closer to 100% of the property value, lenders might consider the loan too risky and deny the application.

The [[Lender|lender]] is at [[Risk|risk]] of borrower [[Default|default]] particularly if the LTV is too high. The bank might not be able to sell the property to cover the amount of the [[Loan|loan]] given to the defaulted borrower. Such a scenario can easily occur in an economic downturn when housing properties typically decrease in value. If the loan given to the borrower exceeds the value of the property, the loan is said to be underwater. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, the bank [[Will|will]] lose money when they go to sell the property for a lower value than the outstanding mortgage balance. Banks monitor LTV to prevent such a loss.

As a result, most high ratio home loans require some form of insurance coverage in order to protect the [[Lender|lender]]. The insurance is called [[private mortgage insurance (PMI)]](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-guide/mortgage-insurance/), which the borrower would need to purchases separately to help protect the lender.

### High-Ratio [[Loan]] History

Up until the 1920s, people bought homes not by going to a bank, but by saving their own money until they had enough for at least a piece of land or land with a house on it. Then, along came the building and [[Loan|loan]] company, which would lend people the money to buy a house then have them pay it back in installments over many years. Even then, loans typically were for half the value of the house or less. 

By the end of the 1920s, banks were making high-ratio loans for up to 80% of the value of the house. [[Private mortgage insurance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage-insurance.asp) came into being to protect the banks, but all that went by the wayside in the 1930s when jobless people stopped making payments and the banks and the PMI companies went under as well.

Congress enacted the Home Owners’ [[Loan]] Corp., which began guaranteeing mortgages and ratios sunk to 15%. Later, through the [[Federal Housing Administration]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-housing-administration.asp) and other agencies, down payments fell to the low single digits and even 0% to encourage home ownership.

This system thrived until around 2007-2008 when the [[mortgage crisis of 2008]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-meltdown.asp) took [[Hold|hold]]. The sharp increase in high-[[Risk|risk]] mortgages that went into [[Default|default]] beginning in 2007 contributed to the most severe recession in decades. The housing boom of the mid-2000s—combined with low interest rates at the time—prompted many lenders to [[Offer|offer]] home loans to individuals with poor credit. After the real [[Estate|estate]] bubble burst, many borrowers were unable to make payments on their [subprime mortgages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime_mortgage.asp).

### High-Ratio Loans Offered

The [[Federal Housing Administration]](https://www.hud.gov/federal_housing_administration) offers programs through which borrowers can get [[FHA loans]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/082616/whats-difference-between-fha-and-conventional-loans.asp) with an LTV ratio of up to 96.5%. In other words, the program requires a 3.5% downpayment. However, the program requires a minimum [[Credit Score|credit score]] to get approved for a high ratio [[Loan|loan]]. There are other offers whereby a lower credit score is allowed with a 10% downpayment.

Also, the FHA loans require [mortgage insurance [[Premium|premium]] (MIP)](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/qualified-insurance-premium/). However, you can refinance once the LTV falls below 80% and the [[Loan|loan]] is no longer considered a high ratio loan, which would eliminate the insurance.

## Example of a High-Ratio [[Loan]]

Let's say a borrower plans to buy a home and it has a $100,000 appraised value. The borrower makes a $10,000 [down payment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down_payment.asp), and the remaining $90,000 [[Will|will]] be borrowed. The result is a [[Loan|loan]]-to-value ratio of 90% or (90,000 / 100,000), which would be considered a high ratio loan.

## The Difference between High-Ratio Loans and [[Home Equity]] Loans

A [[home-equity loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequityloan.asp) is a home-[[Equity|equity]] installment [[Loan|loan]] or a [second mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondmortgage.asp) that allows homeowners to borrow against their equity in their residence. The loan is based on the difference between the homeowner's equity and the home's current market value. 

A [[Home Equity Loan|home equity loan]] is for those borrowers who already have a mortgage, and have paid down some of the mortgage balance, and whereby the property value exceeds the [[Loan|loan]] balance. In other words, a [[Home Equity|home equity]] loan allows homeowners to borrow based on the [[Equity|equity]] in the house. A high-ratio loan, on the other hand, can have a loan value that approaches 100% of the value of the property.

## Limitations of Using a High-Ratio [[Loan]]

High-ratio loans can have higher interest rates, especially if borrowers have a low [[Credit Score|credit score]]. Your credit score is a numeric value that represents your ability to pay back [[Debt|debt]] and shows lenders how much of a [[Risk|risk]] you are of defaulting. If your score is low, your interest rate [[Will|will]] likely be higher.
