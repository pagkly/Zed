[[Understanding Tier 1 Capital Ratio]]
## What Is the Tier 1 Capital Ratio?

The tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of a bank’s core [[tier 1 capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier1capital.asp)—that is, its [[Equity|equity]] capital and disclosed reserves—to its total [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets. It is a key measure of a bank's financial strength that has been adopted as part of the [[Basel III Accord]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basel_accord.asp) on bank regulation.

The tier 1 capital ratio measures a bank’s core [[Equity|equity]] capital against its total [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets—which include all the assets the bank holds that are systematically weighted for credit risk. For example, a bank’s cash on hand and government securities would receive a weighting of 0%, while its mortgage loans would be assigned a 50% weighting.

Tier 1 capital is core capital and is comprised of a bank's [[Common Stock|common stock]], [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]], [[accumulated other comprehensive income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulatedother.asp) (AOCI), noncumulative perpetual [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] and any regulatory adjustments to those accounts.

### Key Takeaways

-   The tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of a bank’s core tier 1 capital—that is, its [[Equity|equity]] capital and disclosed reserves—to its total [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets.
-   It is a key measure of a bank's financial strength that has been adopted as part of the Basel III Accord on bank regulation.
-   To force banks to increase capital buffers and ensure they can withstand financial distress before they become insolvent, Basel III rules would tighten both tier-1 capital and [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets (RWAs). 

## The Formula for the Tier 1 Capital Ratio Is:

Tier 1 Capital Ratio\=Tier 1 CapitalTotal [[Risk]] [[Weighted]] Assets\\text{Tier 1 Capital Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Tier 1 Capital}}{\\text{Total Risk Weighted Assets}}

## What Does the Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tell You?

The tier 1 capital ratio is the basis for the Basel III international capital and [[Liquidity|liquidity]] standards devised after the [[Financial Crisis|financial crisis]], in 2010. The crisis showed that many banks had too little capital to absorb losses or remain liquid, and were funded with too much [[Debt|debt]] and not enough [[Equity|equity]].

To force banks to increase [[capital buffers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-buffer.asp), and ensure they can withstand financial distress before they become insolvent, Basel III rules would tighten both tier 1 capital and [[risk-weighted assets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskweightedassets.asp) (RWAs). The [[Equity|equity]] component of tier-1 capital has to have at least 4.5% of RWAs. The tier 1 capital ratio has to be at least 6%.

Basel III also introduced a minimum [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]]—with tier 1 capital, it must be at least 3% of the total assets—and more for global systemically important banks that are too big to fail. The Basel III rules have yet to be finalized due to an impasse between the U.S. and Europe.

A firm's [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets include all assets that the firm holds that are systematically weighted for credit risk. Central banks typically develop the weighting scale for different asset classes; cash and government securities carry zero risk, while a [[mortgage loan]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/first_mortgage.asp) or car [[Loan|loan]] would carry more risk. The risk-weighted assets would be assigned an increasing weight according to their credit risk. Cash would have a weight of 0%, while loans of increasing credit risk would carry weights of 20%, 50% or 100%.

The tier 1 capital ratio differs slightly from the [tier 1 common capital ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-common-capital-ratio.asp). Tier 1 capital includes the sum of a bank's [[Equity|equity]] capital, its disclosed reserves, and non-redeemable, non-cumulative [preferred stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp). Tier 1 common capital, however, excludes all types of [[Preferred Stock|preferred stock]] as well as non-controlling interests. Tier 1 common capital includes the firm's [[Common Stock|common stock]], [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] and other [[Comprehensive Income|comprehensive income]].

## Example of the Tier 1 Capital Ratio

For example, assume that bank ABC has [shareholders' equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp) of $3 million and [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] of $2 million, so its tier 1 capital is $5 million. Bank ABC has [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets of $50 million. Consequently, its tier 1 capital ratio is 10% ($5 million/$50 million), and it is considered to be well-capitalized compared to the minimum requirement.

On the other hand, bank DEF has [[Retained Earnings|retained earnings]] of $600,000 and stockholders' [[Equity|equity]] of $400,000. Thus, its tier 1 capital is $1 million. Bank DEF has [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets of $25 million. Therefore, bank DEF's tier 1 capital ratio is 4% ($1 million/$25 million), which is undercapitalized because it is below the minimum tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III.

Bank GHI has tier 1 capital of $5 million and [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets of $83.33 million. Consequently, bank GHI's tier 1 capital ratio is 6% ($5 million/$83.33 million), which is considered to be adequately capitalized because it is equal to the minimum tier 1 capital ratio.

## The Difference Between the Tier 1 Capital Ratio and the Tier 1 [[Leverage Ratio]]

The [[tier 1 leverage ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-[[Leverage|leverage]]-ratio.asp) is the relationship between a banking organization's core capital and its total assets. The tier 1 [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]] is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by a bank's average total consolidated assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. Similarly to the tier 1 capital ratio, the tier 1 leverage ratio is used as a tool by central monetary authorities to ensure the capital adequacy of banks and to place constraints on the degree to which a financial company can leverage its capital base but does not use [[Risk|risk]]-[[Weighted|weighted]] assets in the denominator.
