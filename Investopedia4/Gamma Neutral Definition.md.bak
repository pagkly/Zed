[[Gamma Neutral Definition]]
## What Is Gamma [[Neutral]]?

A gamma [[Neutral|neutral]] options position is one that has been immunized to large moves in an [[underlying security]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/[[Underlying|underlying]]-[[Security|security]].asp). Achieving a gamma neutral position is a method of managing [[Risk|risk]] in options trading by establishing an asset [[Portfolio|portfolio]] whose delta's rate of change is close to zero even as the underlying rises or falls. This is known as [[gamma hedging]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma-hedging.asp). A gamma-neutral portfolio is thus hedged against second-order time [[price sensitivity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-sensitivity.asp).

[Gamma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp) is one of the "options [[Greeks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greeks.asp)" along with [[delta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp), [[rho]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rho.asp), [[theta]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/theta.asp), and [[vega]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vega.asp). These are used to assess the different types of [[Risk|risk]] in options portfolios.

### Key Takeaways

-   A gamma [[Neutral|neutral]] [[Portfolio|portfolio]] is an options position that does not change its delta even if the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Security|security]] moves significantly up or down.
-   Gamma [[Neutral|neutral]] is achieved by adding additional options contracts to a [[Portfolio|portfolio]], usually in contrast to the current position in a process known as gamma hedging.
-   Delta-gamma hedging is often used to lock in profits by creating a gamma-[[Neutral|neutral]] position that is also delta-neutral.

## Understanding Gamma Neutrality

The directional [[Risk|risk]] of an options [[Portfolio|portfolio]] can be managed through [[delta hedging]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp), creating a [[delta neutral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp), or directionally ambivalent portfolio. The issue is that an option's delta itself [[Will|will]] change as the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] moves, meaning that a [[Delta Neutral|delta neutral]] position could [[Gain|gain]] or lose deltas and become a directional bet, especially if the underlying moves substantially. Gamma hedging tries to neutralize such a change in the delta.

A gamma [[Neutral|neutral]] [[Portfolio|portfolio]] can be created by taking positions with offsetting gamma values. This helps to reduce variations due to changing [[market prices]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) and conditions. A gamma neutral portfolio is still subject to [[Risk|risk]], however. For example, if the assumptions used to establish the portfolio turn out to be incorrect, a position that is supposed to be neutral may turn out to be risky. Furthermore, the position has to be re-balanced as prices change and time passes.

Gamma [[Neutral|neutral]] options strategies can be used to create new [[Security|security]] positions or to adjust an existing one. The goal is to use a combination of options leaving the overall gamma value as close to zero as possible. At a value near zero, the delta value should not move when the price of the [[Underlying|underlying]] security moves.

Note that if the goal is to achieve a durable, [[Delta Neutral|delta neutral]] strategy, one would employ [[delta-gamma hedging]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltagamma-hedging.asp). But, alternatively, a trader may want to maintain a specific delta position, in which it could be delta positive (or negative) but gamma [[Neutral|neutral]].

Locking in profits is a popular use for gamma [[Neutral|neutral]] positions. If a period of high [[Volatility|volatility]] is expected and an options trading position has made a good profit to date, instead of locking in the profits by selling the position and reaping no further rewards, a [[Delta Neutral|delta neutral]] or gamma neutral [[Hedge|hedge]] can effectively seal in the profits.

## Gamma [[Neutral]] vs. [[Delta Neutral]]

A simple delta [[Hedge|hedge]] could be created by purchasing call options and shorting a certain number of [[Shares|shares]] of the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] at the same time. If the stock's price remains the same but [[Volatility|volatility]] rises, the trader may profit unless time value [[Erosion|erosion]] destroys those profits. A trader could add a short call with a different [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) to the strategy to offset time value decay and protect against a large move in delta. Adding that second call to the position is a gamma hedge.

As the [[Underlying|underlying]] [[Stock|stock]] rises and falls in value, an investor may buy or sell [[Shares|shares]] in the stock if they wish to keep the position [[Neutral|neutral]]. This can increase the trade's [[Volatility|volatility]] and costs. Delta and gamma hedging don't have to be completely neutral, and traders may adjust how much positive or negative gamma they are exposed to over time.
