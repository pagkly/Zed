Examples of residual income include royalties, rental/real [[Estate|estate]] income, interest and dividend income, and income from the ongoing sale of consumer goods (such as music, digital art, or books), among others. In corporate [[Finance|finance]], residual income can be used as a measure of corporate performance, whereby a company's management team evaluates the income generated after paying all relevant costs of capital. Alternatively, in [[Personal Finance|personal finance]], residual income can be defined as either the income received after substantially all of the work has been completed, or as the income left over after paying all personal debts and obligations.

## How [[Residual Income]] Works 

[[Residual Income|Residual income]] measures net income after taking into account all required costs of capital related to generating that income.

Although [[Residual Income|residual income]] is sometimes known as [[Passive Income|passive income]], side hustles can be used to boost personal residual income. 

## Types of [[Residual Income]] 

### [[Equity]] Valuation

In [[Equity|equity]] valuation, [[Residual Income|residual income]] represents an economic earnings stream and valuation method for estimating the intrinsic value of a company's [[Common Stock|common stock]]. The residual income valuation model values a company as the sum of book value and the present value of expected future residual income. Residual income attempts to measure economic profit, which is the profit remaining after the deduction of [[opportunity costs]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp) for all sources of capital.

[[Residual Income|Residual income]] is calculated as net income less a charge for the [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]]. The charge is known as the [[Equity|equity]] charge and is calculated as the value of equity capital multiplied by the [[Cost of Equity|cost of equity]] or the required rate of [[Return|return]] on equity. Given the opportunity cost of equity, a company can have positive net income but negative residual income.

### Corporate [[Finance]]

Managerial accounting defines [[Residual Income|residual income]] in a corporate setting as the amount of leftover [[Operating Profit|operating profit]] after paying all costs of capital used to generate the revenues. It is also considered the company's net operating income or the amount of profit that exceeds its [[required rate of return]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredrateofreturn.asp). Residual income is typically used to assess the performance of a capital investment, team, department, or business unit.

The calculation of [[Residual Income|residual income]] is as follows: Residual income = operating income - (minimum required [[Return|return]] x operating assets).

### [[Personal Finance]]

In [[Personal Finance|personal finance]], [[Residual Income|residual income]] is known as disposable income. The residual income calculation occurs monthly after paying all monthly debts. As a result, residual income often becomes an essential component of securing a [[Loan|loan]].

A lending institution assesses the amount of [[Residual Income|residual income]] remaining after paying other debts each month. The greater the amount of residual income, the more likely the [[Lender|lender]] is to approve the [[Loan|loan]]. Adequate levels of residual income establish that the borrower can sufficiently cover the monthly loan payment.
