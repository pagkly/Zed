[[What Is a Roll Yield]]
## What Is Roll [[Yield]]?

Roll [[Yield|yield]] is the amount of [[Return|return]] generated in the [[Futures|futures]] market after an investor rolls a short-term contract into a longer-term contract and profits from the [[convergence]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convergence.asp) of the futures price toward a higher spot or cash price. Roll yield is positive when a futures market is in [[backwardation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backwardation.asp), which occurs when a futures contract trades at a higher price as it approaches expiration, compared to when the contract is further away from expiration.

## Understanding Roll [[Yield]]

Roll [[Yield|yield]] is a profit that can be generated when investing in the [[Futures|futures]] market due to the price difference between futures contracts with different [[expiration dates]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp). When investors purchase futures, they have both the right and the obligation to buy the asset [[Underlying|underlying]] the futures investment at a specified date in the future, unless they sell their position (to offset the long futures position) ahead of the [[delivery date]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deliverydate.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   Roll [[Yield|yield]] is the [[Return|return]] from adjusting a [[Futures|futures]] position from one futures contract to a longer-dated contract.
-   Positive roll [[Yield|yield]] exists when a [[Futures|futures]] market is in backwardation, which occurs when the short-term contracts trade at a [[Premium|premium]] to longer-dated contracts.
-   When the market is in contango, the longer-term contracts are more expensive than short-term contracts and roll [[Yield|yield]] [[Will|will]] be negative.

Most [[Futures|futures]] investors do not want to take delivery of the physical asset that the futures investment represents, so they close the position before expiration or roll their near-term expiring futures investments into other [[futures contracts]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp) with expiration dates further in the future. Rolling the position allows the investor to maintain their investments in the assets without having to take physical delivery.

## Backwardation vs. Contango

When the market is in backwardation, the future price of an asset is below the expected cash or [[spot price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotprice.asp). In this case, an investor profits when the position is rolled to the contract with a later expiration date because the investor is effectively paying less money than expected by the [[Spot Market|spot market]] for the [[Underlying|underlying]] asset that the [[Futures|futures]] investment represents.

For example, imagine that an investor holds 100 [[crude oil]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crude-oil.asp) contracts and wants to buy 100 again for expiration at a later date. If the contract's future price is below the spot price, the investor is actually rolling into the same quantity of an asset for a lower price.

Negative roll [[Yield|yield]] occurs when a market is in [[contango]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contango.asp), which is the opposite of backwardation. When a market is in contango, the future price of the asset is above the expected future spot price, and so the investor [[Will|will]] lose money when rolling contracts.

Returning to the example of an investor with 100 oil contracts, if the investor wants to roll into 100 oil contracts with a later expiration date as the contract nears expiration, the investor [[Will|will]] pay more money for the oil contracts compared to the [[Spot Market|spot market]]. They would, therefore, have to pay more money to maintain the same number of contracts. Negative roll yields have sometimes led to significant losses by [[Hedge|hedge]] funds and [[exchange traded funds that hold futures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity-etf.asp).
