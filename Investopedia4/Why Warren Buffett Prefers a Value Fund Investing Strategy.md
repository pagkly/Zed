[[Why Warren Buffett Prefers a Value Fund Investing Strategy]]
## What Is a Value Fund?

A value fund is a [[fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fund.asp) that follows a value investing strategy and seeks to invest in [[Stocks|stocks]] that are deemed to be [undervalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp) in price based on fundamental characteristics. Value investing is often compared with growth investing, which focuses on emerging companies with high growth prospects.

## How a Value Fund Works

Value funds and [[value investing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp) are often synonymous with strategies developed by notable value investors Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. Value managers choose [[Stocks|stocks]] for value funds based on the fundamental characteristics associated with a [[Stock|stock]]’s intrinsic value. Value funds are typically used as long-term investing allocations that have the potential to grow steadily over time. Value fund investing is thus often associated with investment due diligence and patience.

Nearly every large fund family offers a value fund. Value funds are often broken down by varying components. One of the most popular categories for variation is [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp). For example, investors may choose from a fund family that includes small-, mid-, and large-cap value funds.

The premise behind value investing is that the market has some inherent inefficiencies causing specific companies to trade at levels below their actual worth for various reasons. Value fund managers are skilled in identifying these market inefficiencies. In theory, once the market corrects these inefficiencies, the value investor [[Will|will]] [[Gain|gain]] from an increase in the share price. Often [[value stocks]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuestock.asp) are also associated with dividend payments since they are usually well-established companies with committed dividend distribution programs.
