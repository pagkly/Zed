Capital Markets: What You Should Know
## What Are Capital Markets?

[Capital markets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021615/whats-difference-between-capital-market-and-[[Stock|stock]]-market.asp) are venues where savings and investments are channeled between the suppliers who have capital and those who are in need of capital. The entities that have capital include retail and [[institutional investors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) while those who seek capital are businesses, governments, and people.

Capital markets are composed of primary and secondary markets. The most common capital markets are the [[stock market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp) and the [[bond market.]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp)

Capital markets seek to improve transactional efficiencies. These markets bring those who [[Hold|hold]] capital and those seeking capital together and provide a place where entities can exchange securities.

### Key Takeaways

-   Capital markets refer to the places where savings and investments are moved between suppliers of capital and those who are in need of capital.
-   Capital markets consist of the primary market, where new securities are issued and sold, and the secondary market, where already-issued securities are traded between investors.
-   The most common capital markets are the [[Stock|stock]] market and the bond market.

## Understanding Capital Markets

The term capital market broadly defines the place where various entities trade different financial instruments. These venues may include the [[Stock|stock]] market, the bond market, and the currency and foreign exchange markets. Most markets are concentrated in major financial centers including New York, London, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

Capital markets are composed of the suppliers and users of funds. Suppliers include households and the institutions serving them—pension funds, life insurance companies, charitable foundations, and non-financial companies—that generate cash beyond their needs for investment. Users of funds include home and motor vehicle purchasers, non-financial companies, and governments financing infrastructure investment and operating expenses. 

Capital markets are used to sell financial products such as equities and [[Debt|debt]] securities. Equities are [[Stocks|stocks]], which are ownership [[Shares|shares]] in a company. Debt securities, such as bonds, are interest-bearing IOUs.

These markets are divided into two different categories: [[primary markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarymarket.asp)—where new [[Equity|equity]] [[Stock|stock]] and bond issues are sold to investors—and [[secondary markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp), which trade existing securities. Capital markets are a crucial part of a functioning modern economy because they move money from the people who have it to those who need it for productive use.

## Primary vs. Secondary Markets

Capital markets are composed of primary and secondary markets. The majority of modern primary and secondary markets are computer-based electronic platforms.

Primary markets are open to specific investors who buy securities directly from the issuing company. These securities are considered primary offerings or [[initial public offerings]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPOs). When a company goes public, it sells its [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds to large-scale and institutional investors such as [[Hedge|hedge]] funds and mutual funds.

The secondary market, on the other hand, includes venues overseen by a regulatory body like the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) where existing or already-issued securities are traded between investors. Issuing companies do not have a part in the secondary market. The [[New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)]] and [[Nasdaq]] are examples of the secondary market.

The secondary market serves an important purpose in capital markets because it creates [[Liquidity|liquidity]], giving investors the confidence to purchase securities.

## Capital Markets Expanded

Capital markets can refer to markets in a broad sense for any financial asset.

### Corporate [[Finance]]

In this realm, the capital market is where investable capital for non-financial companies is available. Investable capital includes the external funds included in a [[Weighted|weighted]] average [[Cost of Capital|cost of capital]] calculation—common and preferred [[Equity|equity]], public bonds, and private [[Debt|debt]]—that are also used in a [[Return|return]] on invested capital calculation. Capital markets in corporate [[Finance|finance]] may also refer to equity funding, excluding debt.

### Financial Services

Financial companies involved in private rather than public markets are part of the capital market. They include [[investment banks, private equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/what-are-major-differences-between-investment-banking-and-private-[[Equity|equity]].asp), and [[venture capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp) (VC) firms in contrast to broker-dealers and public exchanges.

### Public Markets

Operated by a regulated exchange, capital markets can refer to [[Equity|equity]] markets in contrast to [[Debt|debt]], bond, fixed income, money, derivatives, and commodities markets. Mirroring the corporate [[Finance|finance]] context, capital markets can also mean equity as well as debt, bond, or fixed income markets.

Capital markets may also refer to investments that receive [[capital gains tax]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) treatment. While short-term gains—assets held under a year—are taxed as income according to a tax bracket, there are different rates for long-term gains.1 These rates are often related to transactions arranged privately through investment banks or private funds such as private [[Equity|equity]] or venture capital.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are Capital Markets the Same as Financial Markets?

While there is a great deal of overlap at times, there are some fundamental distinctions between these two terms. [[Financial markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp) encompass the broad range of venues where people and organizations exchange assets, securities, and contracts with one another, and are often [[secondary markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012615/whats-difference-between-primary-and-secondary-capital-markets.asp). Capital markets, on the other hand, are used primarily to raise funding, usually for a firm, to be used in operations or for growth.

### What Is a Primary vs. Secondary Market?

New capital is raised via [[Stocks|stocks]] and bonds that are issued and sold to investors in the [primary capital market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarymarket.asp), while traders and investors subsequently buy and sell those securities among one another on the secondary capital market but where no new capital is received by the firm.

### What Markets Do Firms Raise Capital With?

Companies that raise [[Equity|equity]] capital can seek private placements via angel or venture capital investors, but are able to raise the largest amount through an initial public [[Offering|offering]] (IPO) when [[Shares|shares]] become [[Listed|listed]] publicly on the [[Stock|stock]] market for the first time. [[Debt]] capital can be raised through bank loans or via securities issued in the bond market.
