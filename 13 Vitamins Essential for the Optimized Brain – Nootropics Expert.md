[![Essential Vitamins for the Optimized Brain](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essential-Vitamins-for-the-Optimized-Brain.jpg)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essential-Vitamins-for-the-Optimized-Brain.jpg)

Have you ever tried a [nootropic](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#nootropic) supplement and been disappointed with the result?

The latest racetam or herbal supplement was supposed to provide better [focus](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#focus) and [memory](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#long-term-memory). But it was a dud.

At first there is the temptation to blame the supplier for a bad product. Or you may think that nootropic just wasn’t for you.

But chances are the product was pure. And under different circumstances may have worked very well for the benefit you were looking for.

The problem is often a _lack of support by simple vitamins and minerals our bodies need every day_. Nutrients that are fundamental to our health and how our brain works.

For example, a recommended [stack](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#nootropic-stack) suggests using [_CDP-Choline_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/cdp-choline/) or [_Alpha GPC_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/alpha-gpc/) to provide the [_acetylcholine_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#acetylcholine) your brain needs for a [racetam](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#racetams) like [Aniracetam](https://nootropicsexpert.com/aniracetam/) to work.

But _acetylcholine_ requires [_Vitamin B1 (thiamine)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b1-thiamine/), and [_Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b5-pantothenic-acid/) for synthesis. And Vitamin C _induces the release_ of acetylcholine from [synaptic vesicles](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#synapses) on [neurons](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#neurons). Which means _Vitamin C is required for neuronal signaling transmission_.

Aniracetam did not provide the promised benefit because your body did not have an adequate supply of Vitamin B1, B5 and Vitamin C.

Another example, you try [_tryptophan_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/tryptophan/) with the hope of increasing and getting the benefits of more [_serotonin_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#serotonin). But you will not experience the benefit of this nootropic without adequate levels of [_Vitamin B6 (P-5-P)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b6-pyridoxine/) which _is a cofactor and required for the synthesis of serotonin_.

In this post we investigate the vitamins that are essential to a fully optimized brain. And why a quality multivitamin may be the key to getting better results from the nootropic supplements you use daily.

And because of the length of this post, you can find all about the minerals your brain needs for optimal function here – [_**13 Minerals Essential for the Optimized Brain**_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-minerals-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/)

Here’s the multi I use every day and highly recommend: [Performance Lab NutriGenesis® Multi](https://www.performancelab.com/pages/nutrigenesis-multi/?a_aid=5c0957016035e&a_bid=a2ad38c1) for men or women. It contains all 13 vitamins covered in this post at dosages that your body and brain need every day.

## **What are vitamins?**

Vitamins are a group of organic compounds essential for human life but are not synthesized in your body. So, you need to get adequate amounts of all 13 vitamins from your diet, or as a supplement.

We require four [_fat-soluble_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#fat-soluble) vitamins A, [D](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-d/), E and K. And nine _water soluble_ vitamins which include Vitamin C, and the eight B-Vitamins; [thiamine (B1)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b1-thiamine/), riboflavin (B2), [niacin (B3)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b3-niacin/), [pantothenic acid (B5)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b5-pantothenic-acid/), [pyridoxine (B6)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b6-pyridoxine/), biotin (B7), [folate (B9)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b9-folate/) and [cobalamin (B12)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b12-cobalamin/).

Although most vitamins in your diet are derived from plants, you often get them from higher up the food chain including meat, dairy and eggs.

[![What vitamins are good for the brain?](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/what-vitamins-are-good-for-the-brain.jpg)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/what-vitamins-are-good-for-the-brain.jpg)

## **Why we need a daily multivitamin**

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2008 found over 40% of adults surveyed had inadequate intake of basic vitamins and minerals. A large portion of adults were deficient in Vitamin A, C, D, and E.[\[i\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn1)

But even the most dedicated biohacker would be hard pressed to get the vitamins and minerals needed from their diet. The problem starts with our food supply.

One study evaluated the changes in food composition for 43 garden crops in the USA from 1950 to 1999. The researchers found a _drastic decline in the levels of vitamins and minerals_ we assume we would get from good quality food.[\[ii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn2)

Our body and brain require replenishment of vitamins and minerals every single day. Especially the water-soluble vitamins that our bodies cannot store.

_A perfect, brain-healthy diet demands we supplement with a high-quality multivitamin_.

The remainder of this post investigates exactly what each vitamin does in our brain. And why your [nootropic stack](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#nootropic-stack) is not complete without a full compliment of these essential vitamins.

## **13 essential vitamins for optimal brain health**

### **Vitamin A**

**_Vitamin A_** is a [_fat-soluble_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#fat-soluble) vitamin and potent _antioxidant_. It comes in two forms; _pre-formed_ Vitamin A (_retinol, retinyl ester_) which is found in meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products and is used directly by your body.

_[![how vitamin A works in the brain](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/how-vitamin-a-works-in-the-brain-300x200.jpg)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/how-vitamin-a-works-in-the-brain.jpg)Pro-formed_ Vitamin A (_carotenoids, beta-carotene_) is found in fruit and vegetables and must be converted in your body to retinol and retinoic acid before it can be used.

In your brain, Vitamin A is involved in [_long-term potentiation_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#long-term-potentiation) which affects [memory](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#long-term-memory) formation. And _long-term depression_ which affects mood. _Retinoic acid_ is involved in [_neurogenesis_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#neurogenesis), [_neuroplasticity_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#neuroplasticity), cell differentiation, [_synaptic_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#synapses) signaling[\[iii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn3) and inhibits [_beta amyloid_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#amyloid-plaques) deposits.

Because Vitamin A is fat-soluble, your body can store excess amounts. And these levels can accumulate. Excess ‘pre-formed’ Vitamin A can be toxic. But excess ‘pro-formed’ Vitamin A (i.e. beta-carotene) does not seem to be a problem.

Too much Vitamin A can result in memory disruption and depression. Too little Vitamin A may result in dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.[\[iv\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn4)

Vitamin A deficiency is not much of a problem in our Western society because one sweet potato for example offers 28,058 IU’s of this vitamin. And ½ cup of raw carrots provides 9,189 IU’s.

Recommended daily dosage of Vitamin A are given in _mcg_ of _retinol activity equivalents (RAE)_. But every multivitamin I’ve come across lists Vitamin A in International Units (IU’s).

And it is close to impossible to translate RAE from IU’s because the translation depends on the source of Vitamin A (i.e. retinol vs beta-carotene).[\[v\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn5)

The bottom-line for Vitamin A – you absolutely require this vitamin for optimal brain health. But unless you do not eat meat, dairy, vegetables or fortified processed foods, it is highly unlikely you are deficient in Vitamin A.

But you have no reason to get stressed if your multivitamin contains 6,000 IU’s of beta-carotene.

### **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**

[**_Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)_**](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b1-thiamine/) was the first B Vitamin to be discovered. Hence, its name _Vitamin B1_. You get thiamine from eating beef, brewer’s yeast, legumes (beans, lentils), milk, nuts, oats, oranges, pork, rice, seeds, wheat, whole-grain cereals, and yeast.

Thiamine is directly involved in the [_citric acid (KREB) cycle_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#krebs-cycle) that provides [_adenosine triphosphate (ATP)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#adenosine-triphosphate-atp) energy for your [_mitochondria_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#mitochondria).

Thiamine also plays a role in maintaining optimal levels of the [neurotransmitters](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#neurotransmitter) [_glutamate_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#glutamate), and [_gamma–aminobutyric acid (GABA)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/gaba/). And contributes to the production of the enzyme _pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)_ which is _essential_ in making the neurotransmitter [_acetylcholine_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#acetylcholine).

[![Vitamin B1 (thiamine) or Sulbutiamine for brain fog and motivation](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vitamin-b1-thiamine-sulbutiamine-for-brain-fog-and-motivation-300x218.jpg)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vitamin-b1-thiamine-sulbutiamine-for-brain-fog-and-motivation.jpg)Even “mild thiamine deficiency” can turn your world upside down. Thiamine supplementation boosts attention, energy, and motivation. And a reduction in brain fog along with increased mental clarity and less anxiety.

Those dealing with fibromyalgia and nerve pain report a significant decrease in pain levels.

Most clinical studies use thiamine doses from 300 up to 1,800 mg per day. The bottom-line is thiamine dosing is completely up to you. No side effects are reported even at higher doses.

Recommended nootropic dosage of _Vitamin B1 (thiamine)_ is 50 – 100 mg per day.

Or you can use [**_Sulbutiamine_**](https://nootropicsexpert.com/sulbutiamine/), a fat-soluble synthetic version of thiamine which is much more [bioavailable](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#bioavailability). Recommended dosage of Sulbutiamine is up to 1,500 mg per day.

Some pre-formulated nootropic stacks use **_Benfotiamine_** which is a fat-soluble synthetic S-acyl derivative of thiamine. It is much more bioavailable than the _Thiamine HCI_ found in many lower quality B-Complex vitamin stacks.[\[vi\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn6) Dosage of Benfotiamine is up to 900 mg per day.

### **Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)**

**_Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)_** – the two _flavoprotein coenzymes_ from riboflavin, **_FMN_** _(flavin mononucleotide)_ and **_FAD_** _(flavin adenine dinucleotide)_ are essential to most enzyme processes in every one of your cells.[\[vii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn7)

FAD is required to produce _pyridoxic acid_ from [_Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b6-pyridoxine/) which is the form of B6 your body can use. And is required to convert _Vitamin A (retinol)_ to retinoic acid that your body can use.

FAD is required to convert [_tryptophan_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/tryptophan/) to [_Vitamin B3 (niacin)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b3-niacin/). FMN and FAD are also cofactors in the metabolism of fatty acids in brain cell membranes, the absorption and utilization of iron, and the regulation of thyroid hormones.

Riboflavin is an essential part of [ATP](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#adenosine-triphosphate-atp) production in mitochondria. And research has shown that migraines are at least in part caused by impaired mitochondrial function.

Riboflavin has been investigated as a potential treatment for migraines. In one study, migraine patients received 400 mg of Riboflavin per day for 3 months. The study found a reduction in headache frequency and duration while using this nootropic.[\[viii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn8)

The best food sources of Riboflavin are meat, organ meat, cheese, eggs, green leafy vegetable, beans and some nuts and seeds.

Anti-psychotics, and anticholinergic medications interfere with the body’s ability to absorb Riboflavin or reduces its effectiveness. Tricyclic antidepressants reduce Riboflavin levels. And drugs used to treat certain cancers can interfere with how your body uses Riboflavin.

_Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)_ recommended dose for adults is 1.1 – 1.3 mg per day. It is usually included in multivitamins and B-Complex vitamins. And sold separately in 25, 50 and 100 mg tablets.

Riboflavin is generally considered safe, even at high doses. And does not seem to cause any serious side effects. Very high doses could cause itching, numbness, burning sensations, yellow or orange urine and sensitivity to light.

### **Vitamin B3 (Niacin)**

[**_Vitamin B3 (Niacin_****_, nicotinic acid)_**](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b3-niacin/) is a precursor to the coenzymes _nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)_, and _nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)_.

_NAD_ is needed to catabolize fats, carbohydrates, proteins and alcohol. And NAD is involved in cell signaling and DNA repair.

NAD also converts to [_NADH_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nadh/) which is the primary carrier of electrons in the transfer of food from your diet into energy. This energy is stored as _adenosine triphosphate (ATP)_.

ATP provides the fuel for mitochondria in each of your cells. Not enough NADH leads to ATP depletion, which can eventually lead to cell death.[\[ix\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn9)

Niacin boosts the production of _Nitric Oxide (NO)_ which relaxes blood vessels in your brain increasing [_cerebral blood flow_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#cerebral-circulation). And niacin acts as an antioxidant helping to eliminate [_free radicals_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#free-radicals) that can damage brain cells.[\[x\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn10)

Niacin affects cognitive function by stimulating the production of [dopamine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#dopamine), [norepinephrine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#norepinephrine) and [serotonin](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#serotonin).[\[xi\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn11) These neurotransmitters are involved in memory, learning, [cognition](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#cognition), [recall](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#recall) and mood.

Niacin increases [Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor-bdnf) and stimulates growth hormone.[\[xii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn12)

Niacin naturally occurs in foods like eggs, fish, meat, milk, peanuts, mushrooms, green vegetables, and yeast.

Your body also naturally synthesizes niacin from the [amino acid](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#amino-acids) [_tryptophan_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/tryptophan/) you get from food. This synthesis requires [Vitamin B6](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b6-pyridoxine/), Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and an enzyme containing iron.

The recommended daily dose of niacin depends on what you are treating. Anywhere from 44 mg – 4 grams of niacin per day. See the [full review of Vitamin D3 (Niacin)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b3-niacin/#dosage-notes) for complete dosage recommendations.

See the main niacin review for prevention of niacin flushing and [preferred forms](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b3-niacin/#side-effects) to use to prevent liver toxicity.

[![Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid) is the anti-stress vitamin](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vitamin-B5-pantothenic-acid-the-anti-stress-vitamin.jpg)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vitamin-B5-pantothenic-acid-the-anti-stress-vitamin.jpg)

### **Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)**

[**_Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)_**](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b5-pantothenic-acid/) is essential for the synthesis of _acetylcholine (ACh)_. Adequate levels of _ACh_ can boost [focus](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#focus), [memory](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#working-memory), learning, and reduce brain fog.

Vitamin B5 is at the heart of the [_KREBs cycle_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#krebs-cycle) and electron transport chain which helps convert nutrients from food into energy which is used to make [_adenosine triphosphate (ATP)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#adenosine-triphosphate-atp). ATP is the fuel source within each of your cells. More energy increases mental clarity, alertness, memory and mood.

As a [precursor](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#precursor) in the biosynthesis of _Coenzyme-A (CoA)_, it is involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters [_acetylcholine_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#acetylcholine), [_epinephrine_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#epinephrine), and [_serotonin_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#serotonin). Affecting alertness, [cognition](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#cognition), memory and mood.

_Pantothenic acid_ is often referred to as the “_anti-stress vitamin_”. Your adrenal glands use _CoA_ (made partly from pantothenic acid) along with cholesterol and _Vitamin C_ to manufacture cortisol and _epinephrine_. Vitamin B5 has a reputation for reducing stress, anxiety and depression.

Foods rich in _pantothenic acid_ include animal organs (liver and kidney), fish, shellfish, milk products, eggs, avocados, legumes, mushrooms, and sweet potatoes. Avocados contain the highest amount of pantothenic acid among commonly consumed foods, with one avocado containing about 2 mg.

As a nootropic, _Vitamin B5_ is crucial for converting the [choline](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-list/#choline) in your [nootropic stack](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#nootropic-stack) into _acetylcholine (ACh)_. Without adequate levels of B5 you will not experience the benefits of using [_precursors_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#precursor) to _ACh_ like [Alpha GPC](https://nootropicsexpert.com/alpha-gpc/) and [CDP-Choline](https://nootropicsexpert.com/cdp-choline/).

The recommended dosage of Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) is a one-to-two ratio with a choline supplement. For example, 250 mg of Vitamin B5 with 500 mg of _CDP-Choline_.

When choosing a Vitamin B5 supplement, your basic choice is between _Pantethine_ or _Pantothenic Acid_. Pantethine is by far the more active choice when it comes to producing _CoA_. And for stacking with a choline supplement.

Recommended dosage of Vitamin B5 is up to 1,000 mg per day.

### **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine, P-5-P)**

[**_Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine, P-5-P)_**](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b6-pyridoxine/) is required coenzyme for the synthesis of [dopamine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#dopamine), [epinephrine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#epinephrine), [GABA](https://nootropicsexpert.com/gaba/), [melatonin](https://nootropicsexpert.com/melatonin/), [norepinephrine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#norepinephrine), and [serotonin](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#serotonin).[\[xiii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn13)

As a nootropic, Vitamin B6 is crucial for the synthesis of these neurotransmitters. Even mild deficiency results in down-regulation of _GABA_ and _serotonin_ synthesis.

Leading to poor sleep, behavior, cardiovascular function, and the loss of hypothalamus-pituitary control of hormone secretion.[\[xiv\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn14) And increased anxiety, depression, fatigue and pain.

Vitamin B6 has a direct effect on immune function and gene transcription and expression. And plays a role in brain glucose regulation.

Vitamin B6 is needed to regulate _homocysteine_. High homocysteine levels are linked to inflammation that can lead to blood vessel damage. And possible plaque buildup leading to heart attack or stroke.

Vitamin B6 concentrations in your brain are about 100-times higher than levels in your blood. B6 is critical to the highly optimized brain.

Foods rich in Vitamin B6 include bananas, beef, chickpeas, pistachios, pork, potatoes, and turkey. But the problem is some forms of Vitamin B6 from plants (_pyridoxine glucoside_) are not very [bioavailable](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#bioavailability).

Recommended dosage of **_pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (P-5-P)_** form of Vitamin B6 is up to 100 mg per day. _P-5-P_ is the only ‘active’ form of B6 available and _preferred for nootropic usage_.

Pyridoxine neuropathy (nerve damage) has been reported in doses of Vitamin B6 of 200 mg to 5 grams per day for extended periods. When dosing was stopped, symptoms usually disappeared.[\[xv\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn15)

### **Vitamin B7 (Biotin)**

**_[![Vitamin B7 (biotin) is essential for happiness](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vitamin-B7-biotin-is-essential-for-happiness.jpg)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vitamin-B7-biotin-is-essential-for-happiness.jpg)Vitamin B7 (Biotin, vitamin H)_** is a [coenzyme](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#coenzyme) for carboxylases involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, [amino acids](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#amino-acids) and glucose.[\[xvi\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn16)

Biotin influences the use of _branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)_ in the synthesis and release of [_serotonin_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#serotonin) from [_tryptophan_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/tryptophan/), and [_tyrosine_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/n-acetyl-l-tyrosine/#n-acetyl-l-tyrosine-nalt-vs-l-tyrosine-whats-the-difference) from [_phenylalanine_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/phenylalanine/).[\[xvii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn17)

As a coenzyme, Biotin is required for the synthesis fatty acids for energy production in the brain.[\[xviii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn18) Lack of adequate Biotin can result in fatigue.

Biotin is required for the formation of [myelin](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#myelin) which protects [axons](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#axons).[\[xix\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn19) Not enough Biotin can result in reduced brain cell signaling and symptoms such as seizures, lack of muscle coordination, learning disabilities, hallucinations, depression and fatigue.[\[xx\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn20)

Biotin is required for white blood cell development which is needed for a healthy immune system and to protect the brain and body from infections.[\[xxi\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn21)

And Biotin plays a critical role in chromosome structure by attaching to _histones,_ the structure DNA wraps around. Some of the recent research shows how Biotin plays a role in gene expression within your brain cells.[\[xxii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn22)

You body cannot synthesize Biotin, so you must get adequate amounts daily from your diet, intestinal bacteria or as a supplement.

Biotin is found in foods such as organ meats, egg yolks, some dairy products, and some fruits and vegetables.

We do not have a recommended daily dietary allowance for Biotin. So you see varying amounts in multivitamin and B-Complex formulas.

Biotin is non-toxic and safe to take in reasonable doses. But research has recently shown it wise to stop taking Biotin a few days before blood tests.

Because Biotin raises levels of the thyroid hormones T4 and T3 and elevates levels of anti-thyrotropin receptor antibodies. Mimicking Grave’s Disease (hyperthyroidism).

If you are using Biotin before having thyroid labs done, the lab results may falsely report you as having Grave’s Disease.[\[xxiii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn23)

### **Vitamin B9 (Folate)**

[**_Vitamin B9 (Folate)_**](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b9-folate/) functions as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfers in the synthesis of [DNA](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#dna-deoxyribonucleic-acid) and RNA. And converts homocysteine to methionine which is used in the synthesis of [S-Adenosyl-methionine (SAMe)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/sam-e/).[\[xxiv\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn24)

As a nootropic, folate is also involved in _gene expression_, _[amino acid](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#amino-acids) synthesis_, _[myelin](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#myelin) synthesis_, and is _required_ for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters _dopamine_, _epinephrine_, _norepinephrine_ and _serotonin_.

Folate is used in red blood cell production, helps break down and use proteins, and just about every other process in your body.

_Folate deficiency is found in at least a third of those suffering from depression_. Folate touches nearly everything happening in your brain.

Green leafy vegetables, or ‘foliage’ are rich sources of folate. And how ‘_folate’_ got its name. You can also get folate from citrus fruit juice, legumes, fortified foods and liver.

Many neurohackers, including doctors and other health professionals confuse _folate_ with _folic acid_. They are NOT the same.

For a detailed explanation of why folate vs folic acid is such a big deal, see my full review of [_Vitamin B9 (folate)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b9-folate/). It covers how your body uses both compounds. And what happens if you have problems with the MTHFR gene.

Folate is critically important for the fully optimized brain. And research shows that folate levels even in the “_normal (RDA) range_” may be inadequate for methyl donation and neurotransmitter synthesis.

Supplementing with folate or a multivitamin with adequate levels of folate may help alleviate depression, improve memory and ward off dementia.

Discard or avoid buying any supplement bottle containing _folic acid_. You need _folate_ or _methyl-folate_ which is the type of this vitamin your body will use.

Recommended dosage for _Vitamin B9 (Folate)_ is 500 mcg.

### **Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)**

[**_Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)_**](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b12-cobalamin/) is essential for the synthesis of [DNA](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#dna-deoxyribonucleic-acid), RNA and neurotransmitters, the maintenance of myelin sheaths protecting neurons, and red blood cell formation.

Vitamin B12 is a cofactor in the synthesis of neurotransmitters [dopamine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#dopamine), [GABA](https://nootropicsexpert.com/gaba/), [norepinephrine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#norepinephrine), and [serotonin](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#serotonin). Affecting alertness, [cognition](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#cognition), [memory](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#short-term-memory) and mood.

And Vitamin B12 is needed to regulate homocysteine. High homocysteine levels are linked to inflammation that can lead to blood vessel damage. And possible [plaque buildup](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#amyloid-plaques) leading to heart attack or stroke.

Foods rich in Vitamin B12 include fish, shellfish, meat (especially liver), poultry, eggs, milk and milk products. The two best sources by far of B12 are clams and liver.[\[xxv\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn25)

_You cannot get adequate amounts of Vitamin B12 from plants_. Vegetarians and vegans are especially in danger of B12 deficiency. Regardless of what food and supplement manufacturers say.

Plant foods contain analogs of B12 which are similar to, but not the same as, Vitamin B12. They bind to B12 [receptors](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#receptor) and block your intake of true B12.

Trying to get your Vitamin B12 from yeast products like Red Star Nutritional Yeast or Marmite is also problematic. These products do not naturally contain B12 but are fortified with it.

Typical recommended dosage for nootropic benefit and optimal brain health is 100 mcg or 1 mg of Vitamin B12 per day.

Neurohackers older than 40 and those who have a problem with Vitamin B12 absorption should use 100 – 400 mcg or 1-4 mg of B12 per day.

If you test Vitamin B12 deficient, recommended dosage is 2,000 mcg daily for a week, then 1,000 mcg doses of B12 once per week for a month. Thereafter, your maintenance dose is 1,000 mcg monthly.[\[xxvi\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn26)

Avoid low quality Vitamin B12 supplements, and B12 found in multivitamins or B-Complex formulas, which is called **_cyanocobalamin_**. This form of B12 is not well absorbed and produces a small amount of _cyanide_ in your body (_cyano_cobalamin).

Higher quality Vitamin B12 comes as _methylcobalamin_ or _adenosylcobalamin_ which are the forms of B12 naturally occurring in your body.

### **For the B-Vitamins – How Much Is Enough?**

The B-vitamins are water-soluble. And any excess you take as a supplement will generally be excreted in your urine.

This means the B-vitamins are safer to take at much higher doses than RDA. But it also means you need to take them every day.

But this advice comes with a caveat …

The upper limit of [Vitamin B9](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b9-folate/) as _folic acid_ is 1000 µg/day because higher doses of this vitamin can mask symptoms of Vitamin B12 deficiency.

You shouldn’t be using _folic acid_ in the first place. But even excess levels of _folate_ can mask a Vitamin B12 deficiency.

The upper limit of [Vitamin B3 (niacin)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b3-niacin/) is set at 35 mg in the USA and Canada. Primarily because doses higher than 35 mg can cause flushing. You will not encounter flushing if you use _Inositol hexanicotinate (IH)_ which is an “extended-release niacin” sold as “Flush Free Niacin”.

And doses of _regular_ niacin (nicotinic acid) above 1,500 mg per day can be toxic to your liver.

The upper limit of [Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-b6-pyridoxine/) is 100 mg per day because higher doses can cause nerve damage (pyridoxine neuropathy).[\[xxvii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn27)

### **Vitamin C**

**_Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid)_** is a water-soluble nutrient and electron donor critically important for the healthy brain. The active form of Vitamin C is L-ascorbic acid.

Your brain contains more Vitamin C than any other organ in your body. Lack of adequate Vitamin C results in cognitive impairment at any age.[\[xxviii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn28)

Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, and _reactive oxygen species (ROS)_ scavenger.  And participates in the recycling of other brain antioxidants including _Vitamin E_.

Vitamin C induces the expression of [_brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor-bdnf).[\[xxix\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn29) It contributes to _myelin_ formation and brain cell membrane assembly.[\[xxx\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn30)

Vitamin C is a cofactor in the synthesis of _norepinephrine_ from _dopamine_. It induces the release of _acetylcholine (ACh)_ and _norepinephrine_ from [synaptic](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#synapses) vesicles on [neurons](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#neurons) which means _Vitamin C is involved in neuronal signaling transmission_.

Vitamin C is involved in presynaptic re-uptake of [_glutamate_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#glutamate). And prevents potential neuron damage from excess glutamate at [_NMDA receptors_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#nmda-receptors).

Vitamin C is well-known for its contribution to collagen formation. And is a primary component of the basal membrane in blood vessels contributing to [_cerebral circulation_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#cerebral-circulation).

Supplementing with Vitamin C improves mood, lowers anxiety, reduces fatigue and helps combat depression.

Many biohackers take mega-doses of Vitamin C, but studies show increasing your daily dose from 200 mg to 2,500 mg increases blood levels of this vitamin only marginally.[\[xxxi\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn31)

And there is an ongoing debate on the best form of Vitamin C. When it comes to the [bioavailability](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#bioavailability) of synthetic vs. ‘natural’ sources of Vitamin C; several clinical trials have shown no difference between the two.[\[xxxii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn32)

[![Vitamin D for the brain](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vitamin-D-for-the-brain.jpg)](https://nootropicsexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vitamin-D-for-the-brain.jpg)

### **Vitamin D3**

[**_Vitamin D3_** **_(cholecalciferol or calciol)_**](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-d/) is the [fat-soluble](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#fat-soluble) steroid hormone form of Vitamin D. The “sunshine vitamin” is considered essential. Your skin synthesizes Vitamin _D3_ from ultraviolet-B (UVB) sunlight.

_Vitamin D3_ as a nootropic supplement is critical for optimal cognitive health. It’s an integral part of neurotransmitter synthesis, gene expression, DNA maintenance and repair, and the forms of [neuroplasticity](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#neuroplasticity) needed for [memory](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#short-term-memory) formation and [retrieval](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#recall).

Vitamin D3 with [Omega-3’s](https://nootropicsexpert.com/dha/) is needed for serotonin synthesis, release and function. Regulating [executive function](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#executive-function), sensory gating, and social behavior.

And Vitamin D3 is involved in the synthesis of [GABA](https://nootropicsexpert.com/gaba/), [glutamate](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#glutamate) and [glutamine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/l-glutamine/), and [dopamine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#dopamine) in your brain.[\[xxxiii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn33)

Vitamin D3 protects against DNA damage through prevention of telomere shortening and inhibition of telomerase activity. And prevents [oxidative damage](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#oxidative-stress) to DNA.

And Vitamin D3 is involved in neuromodulation, regulation of neurotrophic factors, neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, and brain development. All in areas of the brain associated with depression. Supplementation could be an important part of depression treatment.[\[xxxiv\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn34)

Vitamin D is mostly made in your skin from sun exposure. Not primarily from food like most of our other vitamins.

You get some Vitamin D from foods like fatty fish (tuna, salmon, and mackerel), beef liver, cheese, egg yolks, and mushrooms. Some foods in the USA are fortified with Vitamin D. It’s added to breakfast cereals, soy beverages, yogurt and margarine. Check the nutrition fact panel on the food label.

The Institute of Medicine recommends 4,000 IU per day for Vitamin D3. _Vitamin D is_ [**_fat-soluble_**](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#fat-soluble). So, make sure you take it with a meal containing healthy fats. Or a tablespoon of extra-virgin [coconut or olive oil](https://nootropicsexpert.com/coconut-mct-oil/).

To achieve optimal blood levels and for specific dosage recommendations, see [Vitamin D dosage notes here](https://nootropicsexpert.com/vitamin-d/#dosage-notes).

### **Vitamin E**

**_Vitamin E_** includes a group of eight structurally-related, fat-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidants: four tocopherols and four tocotrienols: α (alpha), β (beta), γ (gamma) and δ (delta).

α-Tocopherol is the most abundant and bioavailable antioxidant form of vitamin E in human cells. And the form of Vitamin that has received the most research.[\[xxxv\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn35)

But recent research from Karolinska Institute of Stockholm shows that _all forms of Vitamin E play a role in brain health_. The meta-analysis found that _cognitive impairment was lowest in those with the highest levels of tocopherols and tocotrienols_.[\[xxxvi\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn36)

Another study funded by the National Institute of Health found that _d-alpha tocotrienol is 1,000X more potent that d-alpha-tocopherol in protecting brain neurons_.[\[xxxvii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn37)

As a neurohacker, chances are high that you are deficient in Vitamin E. A study showed that Vitamin E supplementation has fallen from 44% in 2002 to about 20% in 2006. And _over 90% of Americans are not consuming enough Vitamin E_.[\[xxxviii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn38)

Vitamin E protects cells from damage associated with [oxidative stress](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#oxidative-stress) caused by [free radicals](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#free-radicals). And even the healthiest brain is highly susceptible to oxidative stress.

_High blood levels of Vitamin E have repeatedly been associated with better cognitive performance_. And research shows that high levels of a-tocopherol and Vitamin A are found in the blood of centenarians.

Another study of 15,000 women aged around 70 years who used Vitamin E and Vitamin C over the last 20 years had significantly better cognition than those who did not supplement with these vitamins. Taking either of these vitamins on their own showed little evidence of providing better cognition.[\[xxxix\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn39)

Vitamin E is fat-soluble and found in plants, some oils, fruits and wheat germ.

Choosing the right Vitamin E is crucial because _using a supplement with only alpha-tocopherol interferes with the absorption of other forms of Vitamin E_ including the tocopherols and tocotrienol that are needed for cognitive health.[\[xl\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn40)

The vast majority of Vitamin E supplements _are synthetic gamma-tocopherol or alpha-tocopherol_ which are not the type of these isomers found in food. And useless to your body and brain.

Vitamin E can be unsafe when taken in high doses (400 IU or more). Especially if you are dealing with heart disease or diabetes.

One serious side effect of Vitamin E is increased risk of bleeding, especially in the brain.

High levels of Vitamin E increase your risk for heart failure (in diabetics), worse bleeding disorders, increased chance of head, neck and prostate cancer, increased bleeding after surgery, and increased chance of death after a heart attack or stroke.

Your best bet is to consciously get all the isomers of Vitamin E in your diet. If you decide to supplement, recommended daily dose of Vitamin E is less than 400 IU per day.

And look for a Vitamin E supplement that is food-sourced with all 8 isomers if you can find it.

### **Vitamin K**

**_Vitamin K_** is a fat-soluble vitamin which got its name from the German word ‘_koagulation’_. Because it plays a primary role in blood clot formation.[\[xli\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn41)

We have two forms of Vitamin K; _K1 (phylloquinone)_ and _K2 (menaquinones)_. The two main types of Vitamin K2 are _MK-4_ and _MK-7_.[\[xlii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn42)

Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of _sphingolipids_ which contribute to the formation of the [_myelin_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#myelin) sheath insulating [_axons_](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#axons) in your brain. _Sphingomyelin_ plays a significant role in cell signaling pathways.[\[xliii\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn43)

Several proteins in your brain are dependent on Vitamin K. For example, _protein Gas6_ is actively involved in [apoptosis](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#apoptosis), [mitogenesis](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#mitochondria), [neuron](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#neurons) and [glial cell](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#glial-cells) growth.

And the vitamer MK-4 plays a unique role in the fight against oxidative stress and inflammation.

Research into the implication of Vitamin K and brain health is ongoing. But so far it is clear that this vitamin is crucial for the optimized brain.

One recent study showed _increased dietary intake of Vitamin K is associated with better memory_. Particularly in older adults.[\[xliv\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn44)

You get Vitamin K2 primarily from meat like chicken, pork, beef, egg yolks, milk and cheese. K2 is higher in meat and dairy products from grass-fed animals. And you get Vitamin K1 from green leafy vegetables.

As a nootropic, find a supplement that includes Vitamin K1 and K2 (both MK-4 and MK-7). Natural health professionals recommend at least 2,000 mcg of K2 of which at least 100 mcg should be in the form of MK-7.

Recent research shows that _all four fat-soluble Vitamins A, D, E and K work synergistically for optimal health and brain function_.[\[xlv\]](https://nootropicsexpert.com/13-vitamins-essential-for-the-optimized-brain/#_edn45)

## **Choosing the Best Multivitamin for Brain Health**

Most multivitamins contain vitamin and mineral dosages based on the government published _‘Recommended Daily Allowance_’ (**_RDA_**).

In the USA, the most recent RDA recommendations were published in 1968. But there is an inherent weakness in the RDA. Because it’s like the ‘authorities’ attempting to create a shirt that would fit 95 out of 100 people.

And consider this …

The minimum RDA of each vitamin and mineral is what the ‘authorities’ considered in 1968 to be the minimum of each nutrient to _sustain life_. Not necessarily to make you feel great. Just to keep you alive.

For the dedicated biohacker working toward optimal health and [cognition](https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#cognition), we look at the clinical data and how we feel to determine what we need.

See my post “[How to Select the Best Multivitamin for Brain Function](https://nootropicsexpert.com/how-to-select-the-best-multivitamin-for-brain-function/)” on what to look for when it comes to quality.

And here’s the multi I use every day and highly recommend: [Performance Lab NutriGenesis® Multi](https://www.performancelab.com/pages/nutrigenesis-multi/?a_aid=5c0957016035e&a_bid=a2ad38c1) for men or women. It contains all 13 vitamins we covered in this post at dosages that your body and brain need every day.

Use the recommended dosages in this post as a general guide when reading multivitamin labels.

_Your body and brain require each of the above 13 vitamins daily for optimal health_. Some you will get from a healthy diet; preferably with organic vegetables and fruit, and grass-fed meat products.

The remainder must be supplied by supplementing with the right multivitamin every day. You’ll feel better and your nootropic stack has a more likely chance of providing the benefits you were looking for.
