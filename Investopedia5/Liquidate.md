Liquidate
## What Does Liquidate Mean?

Liquidate means to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents by selling them on the open market. Liquidate is also a term used in [[bankruptcy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) procedures in which an entity chooses or is forced by a legal judgment or contract to turn assets into a [[liquid]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp) form (cash).

## Understanding Liquidate

In investing, liquidation occurs when an investor closes their position in an asset. Liquidating an asset is usually carried out when an investor or [[portfolio manager]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanager.asp) needs cash to re-allocate funds or [[rebalance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp) a portfolio. An asset that is not performing well may also be partially or fully liquidated. An investor who needs cash for other non-investment obligations_—_such as paying bills, vacation expenses, buying a car, covering tuition, etc._—_may opt to liquidate their assets.

Financial advisors tasked with allocating assets to a portfolio usually consider, among other factors, why someone wants to invest and for how long. An investor who wants to buy a home within five years may hold a portfolio of stocks and bonds designed to be liquidated in five years. The cash proceeds would then be used to make a down payment for a home. The financial advisor would keep that five-year deadline in mind when selecting investments likely to appreciate and protect the capital for the investor.

### Key Takeaways

-   To liquidate simply means to sell an asset for cash.
-   Investors may choose to liquidate an investment for a variety reasons, including needing the cash, wanting to get out of a weak investment, or even simplifying portfolio holdings.
-   In addition to voluntary liquidation, individuals and businesses can be forced to liquidate assets through the bankruptcy process.

## When Companies Liquidate Assets

While businesses can liquidate assets to free up cash even in the absence of financial hardship, asset liquidation in the business world is mostly done as part of a bankruptcy procedure. When a company fails to repay creditors due to financial hardship, a bankruptcy court may order a [[compulsory liquidation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/windingup.asp) of assets if the company is found to be [[insolvent]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insolvency.asp). The [[secured creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secured-creditor.asp) would take over the assets that were pledged as [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp) before the loan was approved. The [[unsecured creditors]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredcreditor.asp) would be paid off with the remaining cash from liquidation, and if any funds are left after settling all creditors, the shareholders will be paid according to [[the proportion of shares each holds]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-preferred-stock-and-common-stock/) with the insolvent company.

Not all liquidation is as a result of insolvency. A company may undergo a voluntary liquidation, which occurs when shareholders elect to wind down the company. The petition for voluntary liquidation is filed by shareholders when it is believed the company has achieved its goals and purpose. The shareholders appoint a [[liquidator]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidator.asp) who dissolves the company by collecting the assets of the solvent company, liquidating the assets, and distributing the proceeds to employees who are owed wages and to creditors in order of priority. Any cash that remains is then distributed to [[preferred shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp) before [[common shareholders]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common_shareholder.asp) get a cut.
