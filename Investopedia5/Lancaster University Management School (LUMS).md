Lancaster University Management School (LUMS) is the business school of Lancaster University in Lancaster, England. Established in 1964, it offers a wide range of subjects from undergraduate degrees to postgraduate degrees including MBAs, Ph.D.s and post-experience executive education.

## Understanding the Lancaster University Management School (LUMS)

Lancaster University Management School (LUMS) is one of the four faculties of Lancaster University and is situated on the university campus, south of the city of Lancaster. The campus consists of new buildings and facilities grouped together near the south end of the campus. The Hub area and atrium of the school is primarily a host to postgraduate studies. The Charles Carter Building provides additional teaching space as well as Ph.D. study facilities. It is home to several academic teaching departments.

LUMS is one of a small group of business schools in the world to have achieved quadruple accreditation by the leading international business school accreditation organizations, including AACSC, EQUIS, Association of MBAs and Small Business Charter.

In 2005, LUMS partnered with Ernst & Young to offer undergraduate degrees in accounting and finance, in which students undertake two periods of paid work-experience with Ernst & Young, in preparation for a [[Chartered Accountant]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ca.asp) career.
