Short Covering Definition
## What Is Short Covering?

Short covering refers to buying back borrowed securities in order to close out an open short position at a profit or loss. It requires purchasing the same security that was initially [[sold short]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp), and handing back the shares initially borrowed for the short sale. This type of transaction is referred to as [[buy to cover]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buytocover.asp).

For example, a trader sells short 100 shares of XYZ at $20, based on the opinion those shares will head lower. When XYZ declines to $15, the trader buys back XYZ to cover the short position, booking a $500 profit from the sale.

### Key Takeaways

-   Short covering is closing out a short position by buying back shares that were initially borrowed to sell short using buy to cover orders.
-   Short covering can result in either a profit (if the asset is repurchased lower than where it was sold) or for a loss (if it is higher).
-   Short covering may be forced if there is a short squeeze and sellers become subject to margin calls. Measures of short interest can help predict the chances of a squeeze.

## How Does Short Covering Work?

Short covering is necessary in order to close an open short position. A short position will be profitable if it is covered at a lower price than the initial transaction; it will incur a loss if it is covered at a higher price than the initial transaction. When there is a great deal of short covering occurring in a security, it may result in a [[short squeeze]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp), wherein short sellers are forced to [[liquidate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidate.asp) positions at progressively higher prices as they lose money and their brokers invoke [[margin calls]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp).

Short covering can also occur involuntarily when a stock with very high short interest is subjected to a “buy-in”. This term refers to the closing of a short position by a broker-dealer when the stock is extremely difficult to borrow and lenders are demanding it back. Often times, this occurs in stocks that are less liquid with fewer shareholders.

## Special Considerations

### Short Interest and Short Interest Ratio (SIR)

The higher the [[short interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp) and [[short interest ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterestratio.asp) (SIR), the greater the risk that short covering may occur in a disorderly fashion. Short covering is generally responsible for the initial stages of a rally after a prolonged [[bear market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp), or a protracted decline in a stock or other security. Short sellers usually have shorter-term holding periods than investors with [[long positions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp), due to the risk of runaway losses in a strong uptrend. As a result, short sellers are generally quick to cover short sales on signs of a turnaround in market sentiment or a security's bad fortunes.

## Example of Short Covering

Consider that XYZ has 50 million shares outstanding, 10 million shares sold short, and an average daily trading volume of 1 million shares. XYZ has a short interest of 20% and a SIR of 10, both of which are quite high (suggesting that short covering could be difficult).

XYZ loses ground over a number of days or weeks, encouraging even greater short selling. One morning before they open, they announce a major client that will greatly increase quarterly income. XYZ gaps higher at the opening bell, reducing short seller profits or adding to losses. Some short sellers want to exit at a more favorable price and hold off on covering, while other short sellers exit positions aggressively. This disorderly short covering, forces XYZ to head higher in a feedback loop that continues until the short squeeze is exhausted, while short sellers waiting for a beneficial reversal incur even higher losses.
