Hard Landing
## What is a Hard Landing?

A hard landing refers to a marked economic slowdown or downturn following a period of rapid growth. The term "hard landing" comes from aviation, where it refers to the kind of high-speed landing that – while not an actual crash – is a source of stress as well as potential damage and injury. The metaphor is used for high-flying economies that run into a sudden, sharp check on their growth, such as a [[monetary policy]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) intervention meant to curb inflation. Economies that experience a hard landing often slip into a stagnant period or even [[recession]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp).

## Understanding Hard Landings

A hard landing is often seen as a result tightening economic policies meant to cool down an economy, but no central bank or government sets out to orchestrate a hard landing for their people. Most officials want to see a [[soft landing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softlanding.asp), where the overheating economy is slowly cooled off without sacrificing jobs or unnecessarily inflicting economic pain on people and corporations carrying debt. Unfortunately, the more heated an economy becomes through [[stimulus]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-stimulus.asp) or other economic interference, the more vulnerable it becomes to a hard landing due to even minor checks on growth.

The Federal Reserve, for example, has hiked interest rates at several points in its history at a pace that the market found unpalatable, leading the economy to slow and/or enter a period of recession. Most recently, there was a hard landing in 2007 resulting from the Fed tightening monetary policy to cool the residential real estate market. The fallout was spectacular, with a [[Great Recession]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp) rather than just a recession, but it is difficult to imagine how a soft landing could take place when the speculative bubble had grown so large.

## China's Oft Mentioned Hard Landing

The term hard landing has often been applied to China, which has enjoyed decades of preternaturally high [[gross domestic product (GDP)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) growth rates that – to some observers – have set it up for a hard landing. High levels of debt, particularly at the local government level, are often pointed to as a potential catalyst for a downturn, as are high property prices in many Chinese cities.

In late 2015, following a rapid [[devaluation]](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/chinese-devaluation-yuan/) of the yuan and softening trade volumes, many observers feared a Chinese hard landing: Société Générale put the odds of at 30%. However, trade volumes recovered and currency markets stabilized. In 2019, the talk of a Chinese hard landing resurfaced with the crack down on [[shadow finance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shadow-banking-system.asp) and speculation on what the loss of that credit source will do to Chinese businesses, growth and jobs. Of course, it is worth noting that China has yet to experience a hard landing, while all the western powers predicting it on their behalf have been through a few.
