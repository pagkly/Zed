Leaseback Definition
## What Is a Leaseback?

A leaseback is an arrangement in which the company that sells an [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) can lease back that same asset from the purchaser. With a leaseback—also called a sale-leaseback—the details of the arrangement, such as the lease payments and lease duration, are made immediately after the [sale of the asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-sales.asp). In a sale-leaseback transaction, the seller of the asset becomes the lessee and the purchaser becomes the lessor.

A sale-leaseback enables a company to sell an asset to raise [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp), then lets the company lease that asset back from the purchaser. In this way, a company can get _both_ the cash and the asset it needs to operate its business.

## Understanding Leasebacks

In sale-leaseback agreements, an asset that is previously owned by the seller is sold to someone else and then leased back to the first owner for a long duration. In this way, a business owner can continue to use a vital asset but ceases to own it.

Another way of thinking of a leaseback is like a corporate version of a pawnshop transaction. A company goes to the pawnshop with a valuable asset and exchanges it for a fresh infusion of [cash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash.asp). The difference would be that there is no expectation that the company would buy back the asset.

## Who Uses Leasebacks and Why?

The most common users of sale-leasebacks are builders or companies with high-cost [fixed assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp)—like property, land, or large expensive equipment. As such, leasebacks are common in the building and transportation [industries](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp), and the real estate and aerospace [sectors](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/industrysector.asp).

Companies use leasebacks when they need to utilize the cash they invested in an asset for other purposes but they still need the asset itself to operate their business. Sale-leasebacks can be attractive as alternative methods of raising capital. When a company needs to raise cash, it typically takes out a loan (incurring [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp)) or effects an [equity financing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityfinancing.asp) (issuing stock).

A loan must be repaid and shows up on the company's [balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) as a debt. A leaseback transaction can actually help improve a company's balance sheet health: The liability on the balance sheet will go down (by avoiding more debt), and current assets will show an increase (in the form of cash and the lease agreement). Although [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) does not need to be paid back, [shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp) have a claim on a company's earnings based on their portion of its stock.

A sale-leaseback is neither [debt nor equity financing](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/debtcheaperthanequity.asp). It is more like a hybrid debt product. With a leaseback, a company does not increase its debt load but rather gains access to needed capital through the sale of assets.

## Example of a Leaseback

There are numerous examples of sale-leasebacks in [corporate finance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatefinance.asp). However, a classic easy-to-understand example lies in the safe deposit vaults that [commercial banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialbank.asp) give us to store our valuables. At the outset, a bank owns all of the physical vaults in its basements. The bank sells the vaults to a leasing company at [market price, which is substantially higher than the book value](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110613/market-value-versus-book-value.asp). Subsequently, the leasing company will offer back these vaults to the same banks to rent on a long-term basis. The banks, in turn, sub-lease these vaults to us, its customers.

## More Benefits of Leasebacks

Sale-leaseback transactions may be structured in various ways that can benefit both the seller/lessee and the buyer/lessor. However, all parties must consider the business and tax implications, as well as the [risks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp) involved in this type of arrangement.
