## Upside Gap Three Methods Trader Psychology

Suppose the market is engaged in a current uptrend. The rally continues on the first candle in a healthy session with the close well above the open, generating a wide range real body. This increases the bull's confidence, while putting bears on the defensive. Their caution is justified because the second candle opens with a gap up and healthy buying pressure that lifts the security to a new high. [Profit-taking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profittaking.asp) causes the third candle to close the gap between the first and second candles. The bulls assume the uptrend will resume now that the gap has filled.

Now suppose the market is engaged in a current downtrend. The decline continues on the first candle in a weak session with the close well below the open, generating a wide range real body. This increases the bear's confidence, while putting bulls on the defensive. Their caution is justified because the second candle opens with a down gap and active selling pressure that drops the security to a new low. [Short covering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp) causes the third candle to close the gap between the first and second candles. The bears assume the downtrend will resume now that the gap has filled.

Paul has spotted an Upside Gap Three Methods pattern on the chart of Cellectis S.A. and wants to use the formation to enter a long position in the direction of the trend and set his risk parameters. He could execute a trade at the closing price of the third candle at $16.39 and place a [stop-loss order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) below the first candle’s low at $15.75. David may decide to take a more conservative approach and enter a [buy stop order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buystoporder.asp) slightly above the second candle’s high at $16.95, waiting for confirmation that the uptrend has resumed. He could then use the low of the third candle at $16.27 as a stop-loss point.
