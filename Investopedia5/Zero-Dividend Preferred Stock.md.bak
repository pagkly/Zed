Owners of zero-dividend [preference shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preference-shares.asp) will not receive a normal dividend but they will still maintain reimbursement priority over [common shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common_shareholder.asp) in the event of a bankruptcy. In such an event, they will get a fixed sum that was agreed upon in advance.

Zero-dividend preferred stock is comparable in some ways to [zero-coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp), though they are regarded as lower tier than bonds. Still, they do have upper-tier preference compared with common shareholders if a bankruptcy occurs. This type of stock is usually backed by the issuer’s assets and can be part of split capital investment trusts as a sort of share to produce fixed capital growth in a defined period.
