Key Currency Definition
## What Is a Key Currency?

A key currency refers to a type of money which is stable, does not fluctuate much, and provides the foundation for exchange rates for international transactions. Because of their global use, key currencies tend to set the value of other currencies. Also, these currencies tend to have a stable valuation over time. A key currency usually comes from a country that is financially strong, economically stable and developed, and one that is involved in the global market.

Key currency rates do nevertheless fluctuate daily, and updated key currency rates can appear in financial institutions and financial reporting outlets.

### Key Takeaways

-   Key currencies are stable, globally used currencies used in international trade and commerce.
-   Other countries may peg their own currency to a key currency, or basket of such monies, and they are often kept as reserves by international central banks.
-   The seven key currencies today include the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, and Mexican peso—although other contenders such as the Chinese yuan also exist.

## Understanding Key Currencies

Key currencies form the reference value for international commerce transactions and as an [exchange rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp) in the foreign exchange (FX) marketplace. An exchange rate is the price of a nation’s currency regarding another country's currency and includes the domestic currency and the foreign currency. International commerce is trade between companies in different countries or trade between different countries.

National central banks hold quantities of key currencies as [reserve currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reservecurrency.asp). Reserve currency helps these nations support investments, complete international business transactions, and pay international debt obligations. These banks may also hold key currency to influence their domestic exchange rate. A large percentage of commodities, such as gold and oil, are priced in the key and reserve currency, causing other countries to hold this currency to pay for these goods. However, while a currency may identify as a reserve currency, it may not be considered a key currency.

As a monetary practice, countries with less-dominant economies will align their exchange rates with the dominant trading partner. The central bank of some developing nations may fix their exchange rate to a key currency. This [pegging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegging.asp) has the effect of limiting monetary policy flexibility but can increase confidence in the country's economy. Essentially, by fixing their own currency exchange rates to key currency rates, they are hoping to make their own economy more stable and make international transactions easier.
