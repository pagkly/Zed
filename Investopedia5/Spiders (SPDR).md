Spiders (SPDR)
## What Does "Spider" Mean?

Spider (SPDR) is a short form name for a Standard & Poor's depository receipt, an [[exchange-traded fund]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (ETF) managed by State Street Global Advisors that tracks the Standard & Poor's 500 index (S&P 500). Each share of an SPDR contains a 10th of the S&P 500 index and trades at roughly a 10th of the dollar-value level of the S&P 500. SPDRs can also refer to the general group of ETFs to which the Standard & Poor's depositary receipt belongs.

### Key Takeaways

-   "Spider" refers to Standard & Poor's Depository Receipts, or SPDR, which is an exchange-traded fund that tracks it's underlying index, the S&P 500.
-   The ETF trades at one-tenth of the value of the S&P. IF the S&P is trading at $3,000, SPDR will trade at $300.
-   SPDRs are the cornerstone of many investor portfolios.
-   Due to the price, the fund is accessible to almost anyone who wishes to invest in the S&P 500 through an ETF.

## How Spiders (SPDRs) Work

Spiders are listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE) after the acquisition of the [[American Stock Exchange]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amex.asp) (AMEX) under the [[ticker symbol]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tickersymbol.asp) SPY. By trading similar to stocks, spiders have continuous [[liquidity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp), can be short sold, bought on margin, provide regular dividend payments and incur regular brokerage [[commissions]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp) when traded.

Spiders are used by large institutions and traders as bets on the overall direction of the market. They are also used by individual investors who believe in [[passive management]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passivemanagement.asp) or index investing. In this respect, spiders compete directly with S&P 500 index funds and provide an alternative to traditional mutual fund investment.

SPDRs can be purchased and sold through a brokerage account, meaning that strategies that use stop-losses and limit orders can be implemented.

SPDRs provide investors with value in much the same way as a mutual fund, but they trade like a common equity. For example, the returns of a SPDR is calculated using net asset value (NAV), just like a fund, which is derived using the aggregate value of the underlying group of investments.

## The Origin of SPDR ETFs

SPDRs arrived in 1993 after the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) issued a 1988 report faulting automated orders for all index stocks for contributing to the "Black Monday" crash of 1987. The report stated that an instrument for trading a basket of stocks at one time could prevent the problem in the future. In response, the AMEX and several other organizations developed the SPY. The original ETF launched with $6.53 million in securities and, after initial difficulty persuading institutions to purchase the product, it soared to $1 billion in three years. The size of the ETF market as of Sept. 30, 2017, has exploded to $3.5 trillion in assets. 

## Examples of SPDR ETFs

Investors can use SPDRs to realize broad diversification to specific portions of the market. For example, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF is an investment vehicle that seeks to provide investment results that track the total return performance of the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. This means that the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF indexes dividend-paying stocks that are a part of the S&P 500. The ETF is made up of a total of 109 companies and tracks performance through its NAV, which is communicated as a price per share.

However, this is not the only SPDR that an investor can use to realize a diversified investment in the S&P 500. Using another real-world example, investors can invest in SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF, which is an investment vehicle that reflects the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that conduct business as regional banks or thrifts. Specifically, the ETF seeks to provide results that match to the total return of the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry Index. The ETF is comprised of 102 companies in the S&P and also derives its value with its NAV, disseminated as a price per share.
