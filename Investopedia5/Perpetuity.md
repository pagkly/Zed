Perpetuity
## What Is Perpetuity?

A perpetuity is a security that pays for an infinite amount of time. In finance, perpetuity is a constant stream of identical cash flows with no end. The formula to calculate the present value of a perpetuity, or security with perpetual cash flows, is as follows:

PV\=C(1+r)1+C(1+r)2+C(1+r)3⋯\=Crwhere:PV\=present valueC\=cash flowr\=discount rate\\begin{aligned} &\\text{PV} = \\frac { C }{ ( 1 + r ) ^ 1 } + \\frac { C }{ ( 1 + r ) ^ 2 } + \\frac { C }{ ( 1 + r ) ^ 3 } \\cdots = \\frac { C }{ r } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{PV} = \\text{present value} \\\\ &C = \\text{cash flow} \\\\ &r = \\text{discount rate} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

The concept of a perpetuity is also used in a number of financial theories, such as in the [[dividend discount model (DDM)]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/ddm.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   A perpetuity, in finance, refers to a security that pays a never-ending cash stream.
-   The present value of a perpetuity is determined using a formula that divides cash flows by some discount rate.
-   An example of a perpetuity is the British consol, which were discontinued in 2015.1

## Understanding Perpetuity

An annuity is a stream of cash flows. A perpetuity is a type of annuity that lasts forever, into perpetuity. The stream of cash flows continues for an infinite amount of time. In finance, a person uses the perpetuity calculation in valuation methodologies to find the present value of a company's cash flows when discounted back at a certain rate.

An example of a financial instrument with perpetual cash flows is the British-issued bonds known as consols, which the Bank of England phased out in 2015. By purchasing a consol from the British government, the bondholder was entitled to receive annual interest payments forever.1 Although it may seem a bit illogical, an infinite series of cash flows can have a finite present value. Because of the time value of money, each payment is only a fraction of the last.

Specifically, the perpetuity formula determines the amount of cash flows in the [[terminal year]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/terminalvalue.asp) of operation. In valuation, a company is said to be a going concern, meaning that it goes on forever. For this reason, the terminal year is a perpetuity, and analysts use the perpetuity formula to find its value.

## Perpetuity Formula

The basic method used to calculate a perpetuity is to divide cash flows by some discount rate. The formula used to calculate the terminal value in a stream of cash flows for valuation purposes is a bit more complicated. It is the estimate of cash flows in year 10 of the company, multiplied by one plus the company’s long-term growth rate, and then divided by the difference between the [[cost of capital]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp) and the growth rate.

Simply put, the terminal value is some amount of cash flows divided by some discount rate, which is the basic formula for a perpetuity.

## Perpetuity Example

For example, if a company is projected to make $100,000 in year 10, and the company’s cost of capital is 8%, with a long-term growth rate of 3%, the value of the perpetuity is as follows:

\=Cash FlowYear 10×(1+g)r−g\=$100,000×1.030.08−0.03\=$103,0000.05\=$2.06 million\\begin{aligned} &= \\frac{ \\text{Cash Flow}\_\\text{Year 10} \\times ( 1 + g ) }{ r - g } \\\\ &= \\frac{ \\$100,000 \\times 1.03 }{ 0.08 - 0.03 } \\\\ &= \\frac{ \\$103,000 }{ 0.05 } \\\\ &= \\$2.06 \\text{ million} \\\\ \\end{aligned}

This means that $100,000 paid into a perpetuity, assuming a 3% rate of growth with an 8% cost of capital, is worth $2.06 million in 10 years. Now, a person must find the value of that $2.06 million today. To do this, analysts use another formula referred to as the present value of a perpetuity.
