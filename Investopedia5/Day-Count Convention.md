Day-Count Convention
## What Is Day-Count Convention?

A day-count convention is the system used on debt securities, such as bonds or [[swaps]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/swaps.asp), to calculate the amount of accrued interest or the present value when the next coupon payment is less than a full coupon period away.

### Key Takeaways

-   A day-count convention is a standardized methodology for calculating the number of days between two dates.
-   The interest on most money market deposits and floating-rate notes is calculated on an actual/360 day-count convention while bonds and notes issued by the U.S. Treasury earn interest calculated on an actual/actual basis.
-   The fixed-rate leg of an interest rate swap and most fixed-rate bonds use either the 30/360 or 30/365 day-count convention while the floating-rate leg uses some variation of an actual/360 or 365 day-count convention.

## Understanding Day-Count Convention

The day-count conventions apply to swaps, mortgages, and forward rate agreements as well as bonds. Many of the rules and definitions for applying the day-count convention are set forth by the International Swap Dealers Association, which provides documentation for a wide range of financial transactions.

For example, an agreed-upon day-count convention would be used to calculate the amount of [[accrued interest]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruedinterest.asp) or the [[present value]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp) (PV) when the next coupon payment is less than a full coupon period away.

Among the most common conventions are 30/360, 30/365, actual/360, actual/365, and actual/actual.

-   30/360 - calculates the daily interest using a 360-day year and then multiplies that by 30 (standardized month).
-   30/365 - calculates the daily interest using a 365-day year and then multiplies that by 30 (standardized month).
-   actual/360 - calculates the daily interest using a 360-day year and then multiplies that by the actual number of days in each time period.
-   actual/365 - calculates the daily interest using a 365-day year and then multiplies that by the actual number of days in each time period.
-   actual/actual - calculates the daily interest using the actual number of days in the year and then multiplies that by the actual number of days in each time period.

Each [[bond market]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp) and financial instrument has its own day-count convention, which varies depending on the type of instrument, whether the interest rate is fixed or floating, and the country of issuance. [[Bonds]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) and notes issued by the U.S. Treasury earn interest calculated on an actual/actual basis. This means all days in a period carry equal value; it also means the length of coupon periods and the resultant payments vary.

The interest on most money market deposits and [[floating-rate notes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frn.asp) is calculated on an actual/360-day basis. The major exception is those denominated in the [[British pound]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/british-pound-what-every-fx-trader-should-know.asp), for which interest is calculated on the actual/365 basis. Currencies that are, or have been, closely related to the British pound, such as the Australian, New Zealand, and Hong Kong dollars, also use 365 days.

The fixed-rate leg of an [[interest rate swap]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp) and most fixed-rate bonds use either the 30/360-day convention or 30/365. This convention stipulates the month will always be treated as having 30 days in it, and the year will consistently be treated as having either 360 or 365 days. [[Swap markets]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/11/introduction-swap-market.asp) using the 30/360 convention for the fixed rate of a swap include the [[U.S. dollar]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/u/usd-united-states-dollar.asp), the [[euro]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp), and the [[Swiss franc]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/c/chf-swiss-franc.asp). Swaps in the British pound and the [[Japanese yen]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jpy.asp) usually use the 30/365 convention; Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong again follow the United Kingdom.

The floating-rate leg of most interest rate swaps uses some variation of an actual day count versus either a 360 or 365-day year. The markets that use 30/360 for the fixed-rate leg, which include the U.S. Dollar markets, use actual/360 for the floating-rate leg. Those that use 30/365 on the fixed-rate leg use actual/365 on the floating-rate leg.

The [[London InterBank Offered Rate]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) (LIBOR) is the most commonly used benchmark interest rate and is posted daily at 11:45 a.m. London time.

The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop publishing one-week and two-month USD LIBOR after Dec. 31, 2021. All other LIBOR will be discontinued after June 30, 2023.1

For most currencies, interest at LIBOR is calculated on the actual/360-day basis; the major exception is again the British pound, which is calculated on the actual/365-day basis.
