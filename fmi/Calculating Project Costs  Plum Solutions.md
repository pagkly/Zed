In this video we apply the financial modelling best practice techniques we have learned so far, using links and correct cell referencing, we create a very simple one-page financial model together. We have the annual salaries for staff members forecast to work on the project, assuming each person works 260 days in the year (net of leave, sick days etc.) and assuming each person must work 60 days on a project, we can calculate the total staff cost of this project.
