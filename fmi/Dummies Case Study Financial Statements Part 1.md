The best way to learn 3-way modelling is to build one! So in this section, we get started on building a very simple set of financial statements.  If you’ve done the Introduction to Financial Modelling course, you will recognise this café as this is an extract from the “Financial Modeling in Excel for Dummies” book.

This first preparatory case study has been split into three parts as it’s quite long. It is an extract from the “[Financial Modeling in Excel for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119357543/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1119357543&linkCode=as2&tag=plumsolufinam-20&linkId=38a7416cc3fe1691dafdb1cf4e549e4e)” book.  If you’ve got a copy of this book, you can find the instructions in chapter 10 but if you don’t, you will still be able to follow along with the video.  Be sure to pause the video and then try to build it on your own first, before watching the solution.
