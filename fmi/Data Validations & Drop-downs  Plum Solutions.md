In this video we investigate how the Excel data validation tool can control what data can be entered into your model, reducing input error and making your model more user-friendly.  We explore how to restrict entry to numbers instead of text, and then use a List to create drop-down boxes which can later be used to create scenario analysis in our financial model.
