In this video we investigate logical functions such as IF, AND and OR which are commonly used in financial modelling, and are particularly useful when multiple functions are nested together in a formula.  Nested formulas can get long and complicated very quickly, so in this section we look firstly at creating a simple logical function, and then cover some techniques for building nested formulas to ensure the syntax remains accurate (i.e. that the brackets and commas are in the correct place!)

This section contains a number of practical exercises:

1.  Using a basic IF statement to accept or reject the deal in a valuation example
2.  Nesting IF statements to evaluate maximum and minimum temperature ranges
