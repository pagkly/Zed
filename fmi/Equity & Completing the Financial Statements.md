_This module forms part of the_ _[](https://www.plumsolutions.com.au/online-courses/financial-modelling-excel-online)_ _[FMI Level 1 – Exam Preparation](https://plumsolutions.com.au/courses/fmi-level-1-exam-preparation/)_ _online course._

There are **5** videos in this module.  You must watch the videos and complete the quiz questions in order to complete the module.

The equity schedule for the Henderson case study that we have been working through is quite simple, so before starting on that, the first video will take you through another sample case study that is far more complex, and that way you’ll be prepared in case the one you get on the day is a difficult one. We’re also focusing on completing the financial statements, and what to do if your balance sheet doesn’t balance.

**Step 1:** Download the Course Materials

-   [Equity Example Case Study](https://plumsolutions.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Equity-Example-Case-Study.xlsx); this case study accompanies the first video “Equity Schedule Case Study” and the completed version is on hidden tabs.
-   [Henderson Equity (Blank and Completed Files)](https://plumsolutions.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Henderson-Equity-Blank-and-Completed.zip); this zip folder contains two files:
    -   (blank) is the ending model from the last module, so you can continue with your own model, or pick this one up to begin with
    -   (completed) is the completed version of what the model should look like by the end of this module.  
        Note that the Henderson models are now macro-enabled files

**Step 2:** Complete each of the lesson topics  
**Step 3:** Take the quiz
