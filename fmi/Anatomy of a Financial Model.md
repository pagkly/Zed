_Note that much of this lesson focusses on the ideal best practice and layout when you’re building a model from scratch. Some of the techniques we use when building the model for the FMI exam do not always follow best practice!_

Typically, modellers will work from back to front when building their model. The output, or the part they want the viewer or user to see, will be at the front, calculations will go in the middle, and source data and assumptions should go at the back.

In this video:

-   The components that make up a financial model structure
