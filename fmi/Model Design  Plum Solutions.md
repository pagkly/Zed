_Note that much of this lesson focusses on the ideal best practice and layout when you’re building a model from scratch. Some of the techniques we use when building the model for the FMI exam do not always follow best practice!_

In this video we discover the considerations for planning and designing your model, such as time series, data collection, model purpose and audience.
