_For the FMI exam, you’ll just need to to know how to to calculate growth factors – it’s unlikely that you’ll need to use “to the power of” to calculate growth rates exponentially._

In this video:

-   Calculating compounding growth rates with a constant growth factor
-   Changing this to a variable growth factor
-   Calculating non-compounding growth rates
-   Using “to the power of” to calculate exponential growth rates

### Additional Resources

-   See the section on ‘Escalation Methods for Modelling’ in Chapter 9, **page 265** of [Using Excel for Business and Financial Modelling](https://plumsolutions.com.au/using-excel-for-business-and-financial-modelling/).

_**Note** In the video, the formula in row 25 is incorrect.  Please refer to the accompanying Excel file Escalation – [Completed – Module 3.3.xls](https://plumsolutions.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Escalation-completed-Module-3.3_0.xls) for the correct formula._
