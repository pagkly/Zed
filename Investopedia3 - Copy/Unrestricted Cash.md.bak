Unrestricted Cash
## What is Unrestricted Cash

Unrestricted cash refers to monetary reserves that are not tied to a particular use. Unrestricted cash can be used for any purpose since it is not earmarked for a specific use and is extremely liquid. Often, in order to satisfy debt [covenants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp), firms will have to maintain a certain level of cash on their [balance sheets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) â€” the amount that exceeds the requirements is referred to as unrestricted cash.

Unrestricted cash is a part of an organization's liquid funds. An organization's liquid funds include [restricted cash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-cash.asp), unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, unrestricted [short-term](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortterm.asp) (ST) investments, plus net short-term borrowing capacity.

## Breaking Down Unrestricted Cash

Cash and [cash equivalents](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashequivalents.asp) represent the money that an organization can spend now, as they are assets readily available for use. In order to spend more than that, a company will have to take on a higher level of liabilities through borrowing, such as through loans or accounts receivable. For some organizations with a varying pattern of [cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp), such as non-profits, unrestricted cash can keep operations active even when funding sources dry up.

## Example of Unrestricted Cash

For example, XYZ Corporation makes widgets. They recently issued debt to raise capital for a new widget press. The debt covenant surrounding the new issue specifies that XYZ Corporation has to keep $300 million in cash on hand at all times. The cash specified by the debt covenant is restricted cash. Cash XYZ Corporation has on the books beyond the $300 million and beyond what is committed to other projects is unrestricted cash.
