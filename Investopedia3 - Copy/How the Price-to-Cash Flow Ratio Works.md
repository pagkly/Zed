How the Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio Works
## What Is the Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio (P/CF)?

The price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio is a stock valuation indicator or multiple that measures the value of a stock’s price relative to its operating cash flow per share. The ratio uses operating cash flow which adds back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization to net income.

P/CF is especially useful for valuing stocks that have positive cash flow but are not profitable because of large [[non-cash charges]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncashcharge.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   The price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio is a multiple that compares a company's market value to its operating cash flow or its stock price per share to operating cash flow per share.
-   The price-to-cash flow multiple works well for companies that have large non-cash expenses such as depreciation.
-   A low P/CF multiple may imply that a stock is undervalued in the market.
-   Some analysts prefer P/CF over price-to-earnings (P/E) since earnings can be more easily manipulated than cash flows.

#### What Is the Price-To-Cash-Flow Ratio?

## The Formula for the Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio Is

Price to Cash Flow Ratio\=Share PriceOperating Cash Flow per Share\\text{Price to Cash Flow Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{Share Price}}{\\text{Operating Cash Flow per Share}}

### How to Calculate the Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio

In order to avoid volatility in the multiple, a 30- or 60-day [[average price]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averageprice.asp) can be utilized to obtain a more stable stock value that is not skewed by random market movements.

The operating cash flow used in the denominator of the ratio is obtained through a calculation of the trailing 12-month operating cash flows generated by the firm divided by the number of shares outstanding.

In addition to doing the math on a per-share basis, the calculation can also be done on a whole-company basis by dividing a firm's total market value by its total operating cash flow.

## What Does the Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio Tell You?

The price-to-cash flow ratio measures how much cash a company generates relative to its stock price, rather than what it records in earnings relative to its stock price, as measured by the [[price-earnings (P/E) ratio]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp). The price-to-cash flow ratio is said to be a better investment valuation indicator than the price-earnings ratio because cash flows cannot be manipulated as easily as earnings, which are affected by accounting treatment for items like [[depreciation]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) and other non-cash charges. Some companies may appear unprofitable because of large non-cash expenses, for example, even though they have positive cash flows.

## Example of the Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio in Use

Consider a company with a share price of $10 and 100 million shares outstanding. The company has an [operating cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingcashflow.asp) of $200 million in a given year. Its operating cash flow per share is as follows: 

$200 Million100 Million Shares\=$2\\frac{\\text{\\$200 Million}}{\\text{100 Million Shares}} = \\$2

The company thus has a price-to-cash flow ratio of its share price of $10 / operating cash flow per share of $2 = 5 or 5x. This means that the company's investors are willing to pay $5 for every dollar of cash flow, or that the firm's market value covers its operating cash flow five times.

Alternatively, calculate the price-to-cash flow ratio on a whole-company level, by taking the ratio of the company’s [[market capitalization]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) to its operating cash flow. The market capitalization is $10 x 100 million shares = $1,000 million. It follows that the ratio can also be calculated as $1,000 million / $200 million = 5.0, or the same result as calculating the ratio on a [[per-share basis]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/persharebasis.asp).

The optimal level of this ratio depends on the sector in which a company operates and its stage of maturity. A new and rapidly growing technology company, for instance, may trade at a much higher ratio than a utility that has been in business for decades.

This is because, although the technology company may only be marginally profitable, investors will be willing to give it a higher valuation because of its growth prospects. The utility, on the other hand, has stable cash flows but few growth prospects and, as a result, trades at a lower valuation.

Although there is no single figure that points to an optimal price-to-cash flow ratio, a ratio in the low single digits may indicate the stock is undervalued, while a higher ratio may suggest potential overvaluation.

## Difference Between the P/CF Ratio and the Price-to-Free-Cash Flow Ratio

The [[price-to-free-cash flow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetofreecashflow.asp) ratio, which takes into account [[free cash flow]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp) (FCF)—or cash flow minus [[capital expenditures]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp)—is a more rigorous measure than the price-to-cash flow ratio. This metric is very similar to price to cash flow but is considered a more exact measure, since it uses free cash flow, which subtracts capital expenditures ([CAPEX](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp)) from a company's total [operating cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingcashflow.asp) (CFO), thereby reflecting the actual cash flow available to fund non-asset-related growth. Companies use this metric when they need to expand their [asset bases](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-base.asp) either in order to grow their businesses or simply to maintain acceptable levels of free cash flow.
