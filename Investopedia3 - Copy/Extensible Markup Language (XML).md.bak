Extensible Markup Language (XML)
## What is Extensible Markup Language (XML)?

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a flexible markup language for structured electronic documents. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a programming language commonly used by data-exchange services (like blog feeds) to send information between otherwise incompatible systems. It is readable by both humans and computers and is based on SGML (standard generalized markup language), an [international standard](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-organization-for-standardization-iso.asp) for electronic documents. Many other languages, such as RSS and XHTML, are based on XML.

## Understanding Extensible Markup Language (XML)

Unlike [HTML](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/html.asp), XML allows users to define their own markup. Using XML, one user could choose to denote a footnote with the tag <footnote>, while another user could opt for <fn>. Using HTML, only one pre-determined tag can be used to denote a specific type of information. XML documents are meant to be easy to read since they contain user-defined tags and since the documents only consist of markup and content. Markup is the text that appears between two pointed brackets (e.g., <footnote>), and content is everything else.
