## Goals of the World Federation of Exchanges

The World Federation of Exchanges aims to be the most important global advocacy group for companies around the world that facilitate the trading of financial assets. Because the financial services industry is heavily regulated, and because those regulations can differ greatly from country to country, the primary goal of the group is to advocate for smart regulation that is harmonized across borders.

The WFE also seeks to provide value to its members through the dissemination of vital information to the industry, and by convening meetings where members of the industry can share information and network. To this end, the World Federation of Exchanges stages several events each year, including The WFE General Assembly & Annual Meeting, which is held each year by one of its member organizations.
