Debit Balance
## What Is a Debit Balance?

The debit balance in a [[margin account]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp) is the total amount of money owed by the customer to a broker or other lender for funds borrowed to purchase [[securities]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp). The debit balance is the amount of cash the customer must have in the account following the execution of a security purchase order so that the transaction can be settled properly.

### Key Takeaways

-   The debit balance in a margin account is the total owed by a customer to a broker for funds borrowed to purchase securities.
-   There are two types of trading accounts: a cash account and a margin account.
-   A cash account only uses the cash available to purchase securities, while a margin account uses borrowed money from the broker to purchase securities.
-   The amount borrowed in the margin account is the debit balance.
-   Borrowing on margin is also known as being leveraged.
-   An adjusted debit balance is the debit balance minus the profits from short sales in the account.

## Understanding a Debit Balance

When [[buying on margin]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buying-on-margin.asp), investors borrow funds from a broker and then combine those funds with their own in order to purchase a greater number of shares and, hopefully, earn a greater profit. This is known as [[leveraging]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) their position.

The two primary types of investment accounts used to buy and sell financial assets are a [cash account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashaccount.asp) and a [margin account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp). In a cash account, an investor can only spend the cash balance on deposit and no more. For example, if the trader only has $1,000 in their cash account, they can only buy securities worth a total value of $1,000.

A margin account allows an investor or trader to borrow money from the broker to purchase additional shares or, in the case of a [[short sale]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp), to borrow shares to sell in the market. An investor with a $1,000 cash balance may want to purchase shares worth $1,800. In this case, their broker can lend them the $800 through a margin account. In this hypothetical case, the debit balance would be $800 since that is the amount owed in the margin account to the broker for funds advanced to purchase securities.

The debit balance can be contrasted with the [[credit balance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditbalance.asp). While a [long margin position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) has a debit balance, a margin account with only [short positions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) will show a credit balance. The credit balance is the sum of the proceeds from a short sale and the [required margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initialmargin.asp) amount.

## Adjusted Debit Balance

A margin account might have both long and short margin positions. An [[adjusted debit balance]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjusteddebitbalance.asp) is the amount in a margin account that is owed to the brokerage firm, minus profits on short sales and balances in a [[special memorandum account]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specialmemorandumaccount.asp) (SMA).

In a margin account, the brokerage customer can borrow funds from the brokerage firm to purchase securities and pledge cash or securities already in the margin account as [[collateral]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp). The adjusted debit balance informs the investor how much would be owed to the broker in the event of a [[margin call]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp), which requires repayment of the borrowed funds to the brokerage firm.

Industry regulations permit an investor to borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of securities on margin, which is stipulated in [[Regulation T]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationt.asp).
