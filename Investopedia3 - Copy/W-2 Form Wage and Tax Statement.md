W-2 Form: Wage and Tax Statement
## What Is Form W-2: Wage and Tax Statement?

Form W-2, also known as the Wage and Tax Statement, is the document an employer is required to send to each employee and the [[Internal Revenue Service]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) at the end of the year. A W-2 reports the employee's annual wages and the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks. A W-2 employee is someone whose employer deducts taxes from their paychecks and submits this information to the government.1

### Key Takeaways

-   Form W-2 reflects the income earned and taxes withheld from the prior year to be reported on your income tax returns.
-   Employers use W-2s to report FICA taxes for employees.
-   The IRS also uses W-2 forms to track individuals' tax obligations.

## Who Files Form W-2: Wage and Tax Statement?

An employer is legally required to send out a W-2 form to every employee to whom they paid a salary, wage, or another form of compensation. This does not include contracted or [[self-employed workers]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed-person.asp), who file taxes with different forms. The employer must send the employee the W-2 form on or before Jan. 31 each year, so that the employee has ample time to file income taxes before the deadline (which is April 15 in most years).23

If you live in Texas, your deadline for filing your 2020 taxes and paying any tax due has been moved to June 15, 2021, due to the snowstorm-related federal disaster declaration. If you don't live in Texas but were affected by the storm, [[you may still be eligible]](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/victims-of-texas-winter-storms-get-deadline-extensions-and-other-tax-relief) for the extension.

Employers must also use W-2 forms to report [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fica.asp) (FICA) taxes for their employees throughout the year. By the end of January, employers must file, for the previous year, Form W-2, along with Form W-3, for each employee with the [[Social Security Administration]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssa.asp) (SSA). The SSA uses the information on these forms to calculate the Social Security benefits to which each worker is entitled.3

Tax documents are filed for the previous year. For example, if you receive a W-2 form in January 2021 it reflects your income earned for 2020.

##  How to File Form W-2: Wage and Tax Statement

If you are an employee of a company and will receive a W-2 for your income taxes, it will be sent to you automatically each year by your employer. Your employer will also submit a copy of your W-2 with the IRS. The information provided on [[Form W-4]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w4form.asp) (or sometimes [[Form W-9]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w9form.asp)) when you are first hired provides the information your company needs to keep track of payroll, tax withholding, employer-provided benefits, and pre-tax contributions to things like a 401(k) retirement plan. The W-4 form [tells the employer](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/081214/purpose-irs-w4-form.asp) the amount of tax to withhold from an employee's paycheck based on the person's marital status, number of allowances and dependents, and other factors. 

When you prepare your income taxes, you will need to input the data found on your W-2 into a [[Form 1040]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp) individual tax return, either by hand or electronically. Online tax preparation software now allows you to directly import the information on your W-2 from your payroll provider in many cases. Note that if you work multiple jobs that provide W-2s, you need to input each separately.

## What Information Does Form W-2: Wage and Tax Statement Include?

Every W-2 has the same fields, no matter the employer. W-2 forms are divided into state and federal sections since employees must file taxes on both levels. Some fields provide the employer's information, including the company's [[Employer Identification Number]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer-identification-number.asp) (EIN) (federal) and the employer's state ID number. The remaining fields are mostly details of the employee's income from the previous year.4

In general, you will receive a W-2 from an employer if you earned at least $600 in a given year.

The employee's total earnings from the employer for the year are included, of course, along with the amount withheld in taxes from the employee's paychecks, separated into the withholding for federal income tax, Social Security tax, and more. If the employee also works for tips, a field shows how much money in tips the employee earned for the year.4

When the employee files taxes, the amount of tax withheld according to the W-2 form is deducted from their gross tax obligation. If more tax was withheld than the employee owes, they may receive a refund.

The IRS also uses Form W-2 to track an employee’s income and tax liability. If the income reported on an employee’s taxes doesn’t match the income reported on the Form W-2, the IRS may audit the taxpayer. However, taxpayers are required to report all salary, wage, and tip income even if that income is not reported on a W-2.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How Can I Get My W-2?

Your employer is required to provide you with copies of your W-2 each year if you are eligible to receive one. The deadline for companies to provide this form is typically by the end of January or early February following the tax year that just ended. W-2s may be sent by mail as a hard copy and/or made available online in electronic form, either through the employer directly or via their payroll provider.

###  How Much Money Do You Need to Make to Get a W2?

In general, you will receive a W-2 from an employer if you earned at least $600 in a given year. You will also receive a W-2 if you had taxes withheld earning any amount from your employer. Note that if you were a contracted individual and not an employee, you will likely receive a 1099 instead of a W-2.

### What Do I Do If I Lost My W2?

If your W-2 is available online, you may access it as many times as you need. If you lose your password or credentials for accessing the online site, you can often request automated password recovery. If you still need help accessing your information online, or if you need to request a new paper copy, you should contact your payroll or HR supervisor.

### What Is the Difference Between a W2 and a W4?

A W-4 is filled out by employees to provide their employer with their tax ID number (usually SSN), marital status, number of allowances and dependents, and how much tax to withhold with each paycheck. The W-4 is filled out when an employee is first hired or if any changes must be made to filing status or withholding. The W-2, in contrast, is filled out by employers at the end of the tax year and sent to employees to input on their tax returns.
