Warrant Premium Definition
## What Is a Warrant Premium?

A warrant premium is the difference between the current traded price of a [warrant](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrant.asp) and its minimum value. A warrant's minimum value is the difference between its [exercise price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp) and the current traded price of its underlying stock.

Alternatively, a warrant premium is the percentage difference between the cost of purchasing shares by exercising the warrant and buying them in the [open market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp) at the current price.

## Understanding Warrant Premium

Warrants have both a price and a [premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp). Typically, the premium will decrease as the price of the warrant rises coupled with the decrease in the time to expiration. A warrant is [in-the-money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp) when the exercise price is less than the current share price. The more in-the-money the warrant is, the lower the warrant premium. High volatility may also cause the warrant premium to be higher.

As with [call options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), the premium can increase or decrease depending on supply and demand factors.

## Calculating the Warrant Premium

For the simple definition, the premium is the amount above the [intrinsic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp), or minimum value.

-   Premium = current price of the warrant - minimum value
-   Minimum value = exercise price - current price of the underlying stock

## Example of Warrant Premium

In this example, if the warrant price is $10, the exercise price is $25, and the current share cost is $30, then the warrant premium would be $10-( $30-$25) = $5.

For the second calculation, the premium, expressed as a percentage, is the difference between buying warrant shares vs. buying shares through the open market.

-   Premium = \[(Warrant Price+Exercise Price-Current Share Price) / Current Share Price\] \* 100

For example, an investor holds a warrant with a price of $10 and an exercise price of $25. The current share price is $30. The warrant premium would be \[( $10+$25-$30) / $30\] \* 100 = 16.7%.

Warrants tend to trade at premiums because [traders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) believe that the underlying stock can increase in price. Therefore, the longer the time until expiration, the longer time the stock has to rise. However, as with [options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), as expiration approaches the premium shrinks.

## Difference Between Options and Warrants

A warrant is similar to an option. It gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy an [underlying security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp) at a specific price, quantity, and at a future time. Warrants are unlike an option in that it is issued by a company, whereas an option is an instrument of the stock exchange. The security represented in the warrant, usually share [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp), is delivered by the issuing company instead of by an investor holding the shares. Traders cannot write warrants.

Companies will often include warrants as part of a [new-issue offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) to entice investors into buying the new security.
