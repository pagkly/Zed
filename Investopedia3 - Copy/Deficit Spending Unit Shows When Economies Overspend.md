Deficit Spending Unit Shows When Economies Overspend
## What Is a Deficit Spending Unit?

A [[deficit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit.asp) spending unit is an economic term used to describe how an economy, or an economic group within that economy, has spent more than it has earned over a specified measurement period. Both companies and governments may experience a deficit spending unit.

When an entity spends more than they take in, they may sell debt to raise funds. Governments sell Treasury notes and other instruments, while companies may sell [[equity]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) or other assets.

Deficit spenders can be individuals, sectors, countries, or even a whole economy. When a deficit spending unit is an entire country, it is often forced to borrow from countries that operate as surplus spenders. The effects of deficit spending, if left unchecked, could be a threat to economic growth. It could force a government to raise taxes and potentially default on its debt.

## The Basics of Deficit Spending Unit Behavior

During times of economic hardship, governments and municipalities are likely to run deficits to shield the effects of a recession and to spur economic growth. Although it is doubtful that an economic unit will operate at a surplus all the time, a prolonged deficit will eventually cause long-term hardship for the economy as debt levels become too high.

According to [[Keynesian economists]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp), the multiplier theory suggests that a dollar of government spending could increase total economic output by more than a dollar. A multiplier, in economic terms, holds that a change will cause a ripple effect into other sectors of the economy.

Keynesians believe that as the government spends, it will cause an increase in the population's income.

In the U.S., households sometimes represent a deficit spending unit, as these households struggle financially and do not have disposable income available. As a result, they may not be able to purchase additional consumer products, hold money in banks, or invest in the stock market without government (or private) assistance.

The opposite of a deficit spending unit is a [[surplus spending unit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/surplus_spending_unit.asp), which earns more than it spends on its basic needs. Therefore, it has money left over for investment into the economy through the form of purchasing goods, investing, or lending. A surplus spending unit can be a household, business, or any other entity that makes more than it pays to sustain itself.

### Key Takeaways

-   A deficit spending unit shows how much a company overspent during a specific time period.
-   The opposite of a deficit spending unit is a surplus spending unit, which leaves money for the company to redistribute.
-   The term deficit spending unit is not only for corporations. It can be used all the way from Fortune 500 companies to household budget balancing.

## Real World Example

According to the governor's office in Illinois, the state's general funds budget deficit for the fiscal year 2020 is [[expected to be approximately $3.2 billion]](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/government/pritzker-illinois-deficit-be-435m-more-rauner-estimated) as of Feb. 8, 2019, which is roughly 16% higher than the official estimate from the end of 2018.
