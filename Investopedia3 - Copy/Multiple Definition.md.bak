## What Is a Multiple?

A multiple measures some aspect of a company's financial well-being, determined by dividing one [metric](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) by another metric. Metrics are quantitative tools that measure a company's performance. The metric in the numerator is typically larger than the one in the denominator. Investors use multiples to quantify a company's growth, productivity, and efficiency. They use multiples to make comparisons among companies and find the best investment opportunities.

For example, a multiple can be used to show how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings, as computed by the [price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp). Assume you are analyzing a stock with $2 of [earnings per share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS), which is trading at $20. This stock has a P/E of 10. This means investors are willing to pay a multiple of 10 times the current EPS for the stock.

This is calculated as:

### Key Takeaways

-   A multiple measures the well-being of a company by comparing two metrics, usually by dividing one by the other.
-   Investors generally rely on two stock valuation methods: one based on cash flow and the other based on a multiple of a performance measure.
-   The most common multiple used in the valuation of stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple.
-   Enterprise value (EV) is a popular performance metric used to calculate different types of multiples, such as the EV to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) multiple and the EV to sales multiple.

## Understanding Multiples

In the world of stock [valuation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp), investors and analysts generally rely on two major methods. One is based on cash flow, while the other is based on a multiple of some performance measure, such as earnings or sales. Valuation based on cash flow (i.e., the [discounted cash flow analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp)) is considered to be an intrinsic valuation. Valuation based on a multiple is considered to be relative because the multiple is relative to some performance measure. The [multiples approach](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiplesapproach.asp) to valuation is a theory based on the concept that similar assets should sell for similar prices.

## Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple

The most common multiple used in the valuation of stocks is the [P/E multiple](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/10/should-you-trust-pe-ratios.asp). It is used to compare a company's market value (price) with its earnings. A company with a price or market value that is high compared to its level of earnings has a high P/E multiple. A company with a low price compared to its level of earnings has a low P/E multiple.

A P/E of 5x means a company’s stock is trading at a multiple of five times its earnings. A P/E of 10x means a company is trading at a multiple that is equal to 10 times earnings. A company with a high P/E is considered to be [overvalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overvalued.asp). Likewise, a company with a low P/E is considered to be [undervalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp).

## EV/EBITDA Multiple

[Enterprise value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp) (EV) is a popular performance metric used to calculate different types of multiples. EV shows how much money would be needed to buy a specific company. The EV of a company is calculated by taking the company's [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp), adding total debt (including long-term and short-term debt), and subtracting all cash and cash equivalents. Many investors see EV as a better performance metric than relying on market capitalization alone because it offers a more complete picture of a company's valuation.

A widely used multiple is the EV to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ([EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp)) multiple, also referred to as [EV/EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/what-considered-healthy-evebitda.asp). This multiple helps investors compare companies in the same industry or sector before making an investment decision.

Many equity analysts consider EV/EBITDA to be a solid measure of cash flow available to a firm.

## EV/EBIT Multiple

The EV to [earnings before interest and taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp) (EBIT) multiple, also referred to as EV/EBIT, is similar to the P/E multiple, but is preferred by some analysts for its ability to give a more complete picture of a company's financial performance and actual worth. The multiple is useful for pinpointing companies that might be undervalued or overvalued. It's best used for less capital-intensive companies, with fewer depreciation and [amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp) expenses.

## EV/Sales Multiple

The EV to sales ratio, also referred to as [EV/sales](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevaluesales.asp), compares the enterprise value of a company to its annual sales. The EV/sales multiple is considered an important valuation tool because it takes into account a company's equity and debt while giving investors a quantifiable metric of how to value a company based on sales. It's also useful in evaluating companies with [negative earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121013/how-value-companies-negative-earnings.asp). To be most effective, investors should compare the EV/sales multiple of the company they are analyzing to that of other companies in the same industry.
