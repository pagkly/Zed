Upstart Definition
## What Is an Upstart?

An upstart is a person who has risen in social rank and/or economic status, but who has yet to be widely accepted by other individuals in his or her newly found social and economic class.

"Upstart" is also the name of an online money lending platform founded in 2012 that provides personal loans using non-traditional credit variables, including education and employment status instead of standard [credit ratings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp). An upstart should also not be confused with a [startup](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp), which is a newly formed business venture.

### Key Takeaways

-   An upstart refers to a person who has had a sudden rise to a new class or status but lacks the social skills and grace that would be appropriate to the new position.
-   Because there is an initial disconnect between the upstart and the social group that he or she joins, they may be rejected for apparent arrogance or misreading of certain norms of etiquette.
-   If the upstart involves a newly promoted employee who cannot fit in with others at the upper levels of a firm, it may ultimately lead to their dismissal.

## Understanding Upstarts

An upstart is a person who has jumped up in social rank or economic class suddenly. For example, an individual could go from the proverbial rags to riches following an inheritance or following a lucky investment in the stock market. The upstart, who has quickly risen in economic status, has yet to learn the social skills necessary to be accepted by other people in his or her new class. Instead of being humbled by this and asking for instruction or attempting to learn, the upstart becomes arrogant and presumptuous, which turns off associates in the new social class. As the upstart is increasingly rejected, they often become increasingly arrogant as they are spurned.

An upstart can also describe a person who has suddenly been moved into a position of power or other position of consequence and is arrogant about the change. As in the case of a person who has suddenly become wealthy, the upstart is uncomfortable with the change in status and responds by being arrogant and awkward. Especially if the new position requires the upstart to manage or lead people, this change can be disastrous if the upstart does not have the skills needed to do well in the new position, while still having an inflated attitude about being in the new position.

## Upstarts as Employees

While an upstart can make for a bad manager, they can make for an even worse employee. As an upstart gains money and position, they are less inclined to self-correct and work as a team player, and more inclined to view their own work more positively than they view others. This can cause a great deal of disharmony and bad feelings in the workplace, as the upstartâ€™s manager and co-workers begin to resent the upstart.

If the upstart is unable to correct and restore healthy working relationships, the upstart will fail in the job, even if they have the technical skills to succeed.
