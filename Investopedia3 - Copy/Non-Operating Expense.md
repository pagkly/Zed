Non-Operating Expense
## What is a Non-Operating Expense?

A non-operating expense is a business expense unrelated to the core operations. The most common types of non-operating expenses are interest charges and losses on the disposition of assets. Accountants sometimes remove non-operating expenses and non-operating revenues to examine the performance of the business, ignoring effects of financing and other irrelevant issues.

### Key Takeaways

-   A non-operating expense is an expense incurred from activities unrelated to core operations.
-   Non-operating expenses are deducted from operating profits and accounted for at the bottom of a company's income statement.
-   Examples of non-operating expenses include interest payments or costs from currency exchanges.

## Understanding Non-Operating Expense

Non-operating expense, like its name implies, is an accounting term used to describe expenses that occur outside of a company's day-to-day activities. These types of expenses include monthly charges like interest payments on debt but can also include one-off or unusual costs. For example, a company may categorize any costs incurred from [[restructuring]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restructuring.asp), [[reorganizing]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reorganization.asp), costs from currency exchange, or charges on [[obsolete inventory]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obsoleteinventory.asp) as non-operating expenses.

Non-operating expenses are recorded at the bottom of a company's [[income statement]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp). The purpose is to allow financial statement users to assess the direct business activities that appear at the top of the income statement alone. It is important for a business' future outlook that its core business operations generate a profit.

## Examples of Non-Operating Expense

Most public companies finance their growth with a combination of debt and equity. Regardless of the allocation, any business that has corporate debt also has monthly interest payments on the amount borrowed. This monthly interest payment is considered a non-operating expense because it does not arise due to a company's core operations.

If a company sells a building, and it is not in the business of buying and selling real estate, the sale of the building is a non-operating activity. If the building sold at a loss, the loss is considered a non-operating expense.

## Recording Non-Operating Expense

When looking at a company's income statement from top to bottom, [[operating expenses]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp) are the first costs displayed just below [[revenue]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp). The company starts the preparation of its income statement with [[top-line]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/topline.asp) revenue. The firm's [[cost of goods sold]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp) (COGS) is then subtracted from its revenue to arrive at its [[gross income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp). After gross income is calculated, all operating costs are then subtracted to get the company's [[operating profit]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_profit.asp), or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Then, after operating profit has been derived, all non-operating expenses are recorded on the financial statement. Non-operating expenses are subtracted from the company's operating profit to arrive at its [[earnings before taxes]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebt.asp) (EBT). Taxes are then assessed to derive the company's [[net income]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp).
