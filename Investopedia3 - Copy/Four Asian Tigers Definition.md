## Understanding the Four Asian Tigers

Also known as the Asian Dragons, the countries that make up the Four Asian Tigers share common characteristics, including a sharp focus on exports, an educated populace, and high savings rates. The economies of the Four Tigers have proven resilient enough to withstand local crises such as the [Asian financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asian-financial-crisis.asp) of 1997 and global shocks like the [credit crunch](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcrunch.asp) of 2008.

The International Monetary Fund includes the Four Asian Tigers in its category of 35 most advanced economies.

In the 1960s, South Korea's per capita gross domestic product was comparable to the poorest countries in Asia and Africa. But in the four decades since then, the country has observed substantial growth, affected in part by a system of close government, directed credit, and import restrictions. As of Dec. 2020, South Korea had a total GDP of $1.59 trillion and a per capita GDP of $30,640 with a growth rate of -1.9% and a population of 51.8 million.1

### Taiwan

Despite its contentious relationship with China, Taiwan has thrived over the last four decades. As of Dec. 2020, Taiwan's GDP per capita was $28,180. Due to pressure from China, the country is not a part of the United Nations, but it has nevertheless emerged as a reliable exporter. Its GDP was $660 billion with a growth rate of 2.5%, making this nation of 23.6 million people one of the strongest economies in Asia.2

The latest reports show that the region ranks exceptionally high on scales measuring economic freedom, boasting a GDP of approximately $340 billion as of Dec. 2020, a GDP per capita of $45,180, a growth rate of 2.9%, and a population of 7.6 million.3

## Special Considerations

Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia are sometimes referred to as the "Tiger Cub Economies," because while they have developed more slowly than the Four Asian Tigers in the decades since the 1950s, they have nonetheless grown at a steady rate.
