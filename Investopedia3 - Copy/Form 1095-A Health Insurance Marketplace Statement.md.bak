Form 1095-A: Health Insurance Marketplace Statement
## What Is Form 1095-A: Health Insurance Marketplace Statement?

Form 1095-A is a form that is sent to Americans who obtain health insurance coverage through a [Health Insurance Marketplace](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/health-insurance-marketplace.asp) carrier.

The form does not have to be returned to the government but serves as a record of the individual's coverage. It includes information such as the effective date of the coverage, the premium amounts paid monthly, and any advance payments of the premium [tax credit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxcredit.asp) or subsidy.

### Key Takeaways

-   If you buy your health insurance through the Marketplace you should receive a Form 1095-A.
-   You don't have to send the form in with your tax return.
-   However, if you are eligible for a subsidy or tax credit, you need to transfer that information to Form 8962 and include it with your tax return.

The form was created with the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affordable-care-act.asp) (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare. People who receive coverage from the Marketplace created by that law may be eligible for subsidized coverage or for a tax credit. A penalty for taxpayers who are not covered by health insurance was abolished at the start of 2019.1

## Who Can File Form 1095-A: Health Insurance Marketplace Statement?

You will receive Form 1095-A if you enrolled in a qualified health plan via the federal Health Insurance Marketplace or a state's exchange. The exchanges use the form to provide participants in different markets with information on their coverage.

You do not have to submit Form 1095-A itself. You have to provide information from the form or acknowledge that you have received one on the federal tax return.

If you are eligible for a premium tax credit, you may have to attach a related form, Form 8962: Premium Tax Credit.

You should keep Form 1095-A for your records. The form is issued, as suggested by its title, by the Health Insurance Marketplace.

The penalty for having no health coverage has been abolished; however, some buyers are still eligible for tax credits for buying it.

## How to File Form 1095-A: Health Insurance Marketplace Statement

When preparing your tax return, you or your tax preparer will use 1095-A to fill out Form 8962: Premium Tax Credit if you are eligible to receive the credit.

According to the IRS, if you are expecting to receive a Form 1095-A, you should wait to file your income tax return until you receive it. Because it deals with claiming or reporting of tax credits, which in turn affects the amount of income tax you owe or any refunds you are due, 1095-A is crucial in the filing process.2

Taxpayers should receive a Form 1095-A by mid-January of the year following the coverage year, either by mail or in their [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/contact-us/) accounts. Individuals who don't receive their forms or see inaccuracies in them can contact HealthCare.gov directly.

The form lists each month for which you received coverage and the amount you paid in premiums. It also contains personal information including your name, address, and Social Security Number. Your policy number and insurance company name also appear on the form.

The complete 1095-A is available on the IRS website.3
